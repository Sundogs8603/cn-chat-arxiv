As a result of this insecure curation pipeline, an adversary can poison or backdoor the resulting model by uploading malicious data to the internet and waiting for a victim to scrape and train on it. Existing approaches for creating poisons and backdoors start with randomly sampled clean data, called base samples, and then modify those samples to craft poisons. However, some base samples may be significantly more amenable to poisoning than others. As a result, we may be able to craft more potent poisons by carefully choosing the base samples. In this work, we use guided diffusion to synthesize base samples from scratch that lead to significantly more potent poisons and backdoors than previous state-of-the-art attacks.

    "translated_abstract": "现代神经网络经常在大规模数据集上进行训练，这些数据集经常不受人工检查而是通过网络抓取得到。由于这种不安全的筛选过程，攻击者可以通过向互联网上传恶意数据并等待受害者抓取和训练它，来污染或植入后门到生成的模型中。现有的创建毒药和后门的方法通常从随机抽取的干净数据（称为基础样本）开始，然后修改这些样本来生成毒药。但是，一些基础样本可能比其他更容易受到毒害。因此，我们可以通过仔细选择基础样本来精心制作更强大的毒药。在这项工作中，我们使用引导扩散从头开始合成基础样本，这些基础样本比先前的最先进攻击产生的更强大的毒药和后门。我们的Guided Diffusion Poisoning (GDP)基础样本可以与任何下游毒害或后门结合使用。",
