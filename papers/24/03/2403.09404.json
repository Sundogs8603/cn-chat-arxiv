Through a series of innovative experiments, including variations of the classic Linda problem and a novel application of the Beauty Contest game, we uncover trade-offs between accuracy maximization and effort reduction that shape the conditions under which AIs transition between exhaustive logical processing and the use of cognitive shortcuts (heuristics). We distinguish between the 'instrumental' use of heuristics to match resources with objectives, and 'mimetic absorption,' whereby heuristics are learned from humans, and manifest randomly and universally. We provide evidence that AI, despite lacking intrinsic goals or self-awareness, manifests an adaptive balancing of precision and efficiency, consistent with principles of resource-rational human cognition as explicated in classical theories of bounded rationality and dual-process theory.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的启发式推理方案，用于人工智能系统。通过一系列创新性实验，包括对经典琳达问题的变体和对美丽比赛游戏的新应用，我们揭示了精度最大化和努力减少之间的权衡，塑造了人工智能在何种条件下在详尽的逻辑处理和使用认知快捷方式（启发式）之间转换。我们区分了启发式的'工具性'使用，以匹配资源与目标，以及'模仿吸收'，即从人类那里学到的启发式，并表现为随机且普遍存在。我们提供证据表明，尽管缺乏内在目标或自我意识，人工智能表现出精度和效率的自适应平衡，符合资源理性人类认知的原则，这是受限理性和双系统理论经典理论的明文阐释。",
