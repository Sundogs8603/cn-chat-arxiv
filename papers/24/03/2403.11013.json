    "translated_abstract": "在$d$维空间中给定一个包含$K$个顶点的单纯形，假设我们在单纯形上测量$n$个带有噪声的点（因此，一些观测点落在单纯形之外）。顶点搜索是估计单纯形的$K$个顶点的问题。一个常用的顶点搜索算法是连续投影算法（SPA）。然而，在强噪声或异常值下，观察到SPA表现不佳。我们提出了伪点SPA（pp-SPA）。它使用投影步骤和去噪步骤生成伪点，并将它们输入到SPA中进行顶点搜索。我们基于（可能是）高维随机向量的极值理论推导了pp-SPA的误差界限。结果表明，pp-SPA比SPA具有更快的收敛速度和更好的数值性能。我们的分析包括对原始SPA的改进非渐近界限，这具有独立的价值。",
