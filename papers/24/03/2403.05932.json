    "translated_abstract": "气候预测和云物理学中的重要不确定性与关于稀疏散射云的观测空隙相关。为了解决这些挑战，需要远程感测它们的三维（3D）异质体积散射内容。这需要进行被动散射计算断层摄影（CT）。我们设计了一个基于学习的模型（ProbCT），通过嘈杂的多视角航天图像实现这类云的CT。ProbCT首次推断出每个3D位置的异质消光系数的后验概率分布，这产生了任意有价值的统计数据，例如最可能的消光的3D场和其不确定性。ProbCT使用神经场表示，实质上可以进行实时推断。ProbCT通过一个新的带标签的基于物理的多类数据库的监督训练，包括云的体积场和相应的图像，以改善其越界性能。",
