    "translated_abstract": "具有复杂语义的环境地图对于促进机器人和人类之间的无缝交互至关重要，使它们能够有效地执行各种任务。开放词汇地图，由视觉-语言模型（VLM）驱动，具有固有优势，包括多模态检索和开放类别。然而，现有的开放词汇地图受限于封闭的室内场景和VLM特征，从而降低了它们的可用性和推理能力。此外，缺乏拓扑关系进一步使得对特定实例的准确查询变得复杂。在这项工作中，我们提出了OpenGraph，这是一种为大规模室外环境设计的开放词汇分层图结构表示。OpenGraph首先利用2D基础模型从视觉图像中提取实例及其标题，并对标题进行特征编码以增强文字推理。随后，3D进",
