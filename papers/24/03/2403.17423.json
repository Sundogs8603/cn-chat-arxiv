    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络在各种计算机视觉应用中取得了显著成功。然而，当数据分布在训练和测试之间发生偏移时，准确性会下降。为了解决这一问题，测试时间适应（TTA）已被广泛研究因为其实用性。虽然TTA方法通过在测试时更新模型来提高在分布偏移下的准确性，但使用高不确定性预测已知会降低准确性。由于输入图像是分布偏移的根源，我们将一个新的视角融入到TTA方法中，通过增强输入图像来减少预测的不确定性。我们假设增强输入图像可以降低预测的不确定性，提高TTA方法的准确性。基于这一假设，我们提出了一种新的方法：测试时间增强器和分类器适应（TECA）。在TECA中，分类模型与增强模型同时训练并在测试时进行适应，以提高测试时性能。",
