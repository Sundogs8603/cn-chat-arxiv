    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的最新进展开辟了许多领域的新路径。然而，在金融投资领域中，LLMs 的完整潜力仍然大部分未被利用。对于量化金融的典型基于深度学习的方法有两个主要挑战。首先，它们在股票走势预测中灵活融合文本和数值信息上存在困难。其次，传统方法缺乏清晰性和可解释性，这妨碍了它们在需要预测理由的场景中的应用。为了解决上述挑战，我们提出了 Ploutos，一个由 PloutosGen 和 PloutosGPT 组成的新型金融LLM框架。PloutosGen 包含多个主要专家，可以分析不同的模态数据，如文本和数值，并从不同角度提供量化策略。然后 PloutosGPT 结合它们的见解和预测，生成可解释性的推理。",
