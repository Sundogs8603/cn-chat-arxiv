    "translated_abstract": "神经主题模型可以成功地在文本数据中找到连贯且多样化的主题。然而，它们在处理多模态数据集（如图片和文本）方面存在局限性。本文首次提出了包含文本和图片的文档的多模态主题建模的系统性和全面评估。在此过程中，我们提出了两种新颖的主题建模解决方案和两种新颖的评估指标。总体而言，我们对一个前所未有的丰富多样的数据集集合进行的评估表明，我们的两个模型都能产生连贯且多样化的主题。然而，一个方法优于另一个方法的程度取决于指标和数据集的组合，这表明未来需要进一步探索混合解决方案。值得注意的是，我们简洁的人工评估与我们提出的指标所确定的结果一致。这种一致不仅加强了我们指标的可信度，也突显了",
