Providing example documents of interest might be easier for a user. However, such query-by-example scenarios are prone to concept drift, and the retrieval effectiveness is highly sensitive to the query generation method, without a clear way to incorporate user feedback. To enable exploration and to support Human-In-The-Loop experiments we propose QueryExplorer -- an interactive query generation, reformulation, and retrieval interface with support for HuggingFace generation models and PyTerrier's retrieval pipelines and datasets, and extensive logging of human feedback.

    "translated_abstract": "有效制定搜索查询仍然是一项具有挑战性的任务，特别是当用户缺乏特定领域的专业知识或不擅长内容的语言时。提供用户感兴趣的示例文档可能更容易一些。然而，通过示例进行查询的情况容易出现概念漂移，并且检索效果对查询生成方法非常敏感，且没有明确的方法来整合用户反馈。为了实现探索并支持人机实验，我们提出了QueryExplorer -- 一个交互式查询生成、重新构造和检索界面，支持HuggingFace生成模型和PyTerrier的检索管道和数据集，以及对人类反馈的详尽记录。为了让用户创建和修改有效的查询，我们的演示支持使用LLMs的互补方法，协助用户在多个阶段进行编辑和反馈。",
