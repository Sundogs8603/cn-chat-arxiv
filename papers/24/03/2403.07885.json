In this paper, we use $\\mathrm{MOD_{YOLO}}$, a multi-label object detection model built upon the state-of-the-art object detection model YOLOv8, which has been published in recent years. In Task 1, we introduce the Corrector Model and Blender Model, two new models that follow after the object detection process, aiming to generate a more constrained output. For Task 2, constrained losses have been incorporated into the $\\mathrm{MOD_{YOLO}}$ architecture using Product T-Norm. The results show that these implementations are instrumental to improving the scores for both Task 1 and Task 2.",
