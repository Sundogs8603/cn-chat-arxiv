    "translated_abstract": "CLIP的最新成功证明了通过将多模态知识转移到像素级分类来进行零样本语义分割的有希望的结果。然而，在现有方法中，利用预先训练的CLIP知识来紧密对齐文本嵌入和像素嵌入仍然存在局限性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了OTSeg，这是一种新颖的多模态注意力机制，旨在增强多个文本提示匹配相关像素嵌入的潜力。我们首先提出了基于最优输运（OT）算法的多提示Sinkhorn（MPS），这使得多个文本提示可以有选择地关注图像像素内的各种语义特征。此外，受到Sinkformers在单模态设置中的成功启发，我们引入了MPS的扩展，称为多提示Sinkhorn注意力（MPSA），它有效地取代了Transformer框架中多模态设置中的交叉注意力机制。",
