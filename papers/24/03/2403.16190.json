This further increases the confidence of the model. Given this, obtaining an explanation of the cause of rejection is important to not blindly trust the obtained results. While most of the related work has developed means to give such explanations for machine learning models, to the best of our knowledge none have done so for when reject option is present.

We evaluate our approach by comparing it to Anchors, which is a heuristic algorithm for generating explanations. Obtained results show that our proposed method gives shorter explanations",

    "translated_abstract": "支持向量分类器（SVC）是一种用于线性分类问题的众所周知的机器学习（ML）模型。它可以与拒绝选项策略结合使用，拒绝难以正确分类的实例，并将它们委托给专家。这进一步增加了模型的信心。因此，获得拒绝原因的解释对于不盲目信任所获结果是重要的。尽管大多数相关工作已经开发出了针对机器学习模型提供这种解释的手段，但就我们所知，尚未有人为存在拒绝选项时提供这种解释。我们提出了一种基于逻辑的方法，对具有拒绝选项的线性SVC的解释进行正确性和极小性的形式保证。我们通过将其与生成解释的启发式算法Anchors进行比较来评估我们的方法。所获结果显示，我们提出的方法给出了更短的解释。",
