    "translated_abstract": "特征归因是一种常用的解释类型，用于在训练模型后事后解释预测。然而，在信息检索领域，这种方法并没有得到很好的研究。重要的是，特征归因很少被严格定义，除了将最重要的特征归因为最高值之外。什么是比其他特征更重要的特征往往被模糊地描述。因此，大多数方法只关注选择最重要的特征，不充分利用甚至忽视特征内的相对重要性。在这项工作中，我们严格定义了排名模型特征归因的概念，并列出了一个有效归因应具备的基本属性。然后，我们提出RankingSHAP作为逐项排名归因方法的具体实例。与目前关注选择的解释评估方案相反，我们提出了两种用于评估归因的新颖评估范式。",
