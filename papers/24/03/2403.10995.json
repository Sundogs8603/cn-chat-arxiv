    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）在从图结构化数据中学习表示方面发挥关键作用，并被证明在许多应用中非常有用。然而，GNN训练流程已被显示容易受到节点特征泄漏和边提取攻击的影响。本文研究了一种情景，其中攻击者旨在从训练过的GNN模型中恢复私有边缘信息。先前的研究采用差分隐私（DP）直接向邻接矩阵或紧凑图表示添加噪声。添加的扰动导致图结构被大幅改变，降低了模型的效用。我们提出了一种新的保护隐私的GNN训练算法Eclipse，该算法在提供强大的隐私保护的同时保持了良好的模型效用。Eclipse基于两个关键观察结果。第一，图结构中的邻接矩阵表现出低秩行为。因此，Eclipse使用低秩的方式训练GNNs。",
