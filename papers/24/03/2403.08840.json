    "translated_abstract": "基于扩散模型的图像插值在创建新颖有趣的图像方面具有很大潜力。高级插值方法主要集中在球面线性插值上，其中图像被编码到噪声空间，然后进行插值以将去噪转换回图像。然而，现有方法在有效插值自然图像（而非扩散模型生成的图像）方面面临挑战，从而限制了它们的实际适用性。我们的实验调查显示，这些挑战源于编码噪声的无效性，可能不再遵循预期的噪声分布，如正态分布。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的方法来校正图像插值中的噪声，NoiseDiffusion。具体而言，NoiseDiffusion通过引入微妙的高斯噪声将无效的噪声逼近到预期的分布，并引入一个约束条件来抑制具有极端值的噪声。",
