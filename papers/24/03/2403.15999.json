    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在具有高斯测量矩阵的痕迹回归模型下，对秩为$r$的矩阵$M \\in \\RR^{d_1\\times d_2}$进行差分隐私（DP）估计。在理论上，精确表征了非私有谱初始化的敏感性，并建立了在Schatten-$q$范数下估计$M$的差分隐私约束极小概率下界。在方法论上，本文引入了一个计算效率高的DP初始化算法，其样本大小为$n \\geq \\wt O (r^2 (d_1\\vee d_2))$。在一定的正则条件下，DP初始化落入围绕$M$的局部球内。我们还提出了一种基于黎曼优化的用于估计$M$的差分隐私算法（DP-RGrad），通过DP初始化和样本大小$n \\geq \\wt O(r (d_1 + d_2))$实现了近最优收敛速度。最后，本文讨论了在差分隐私初始化和样本大小条件下的所估计的$M$之间的非平凡差距。",
