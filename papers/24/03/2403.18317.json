Situations serve as the background for interactions, where relationships between users and items evolve with situation changes. However, existing RecSys treat situations, users, and items on the same level. They can only model the relations between situations and users/items respectively, rather than the dynamic impact of situations on user-item associations (i.e., user preferences). In this paper, we provide a new perspective that takes situations as the preconditions for users' interactions. This perspective allows us to separate situations from user/item representations, and capture situations' influences over the user-item relationship, offering a more comprehensive understanding of situations.

    "translated_abstract": "当用户与推荐系统（RecSys）交互时，当前的情境，比如时间、地点和环境，显著影响他们的偏好。情境作为交互的背景，用户和物品之间的关系随着情境变化而发展。然而，现有的RecSys将情境、用户和物品视为同一级别。它们只能分别建模情境与用户/物品之间的关系，而无法建模情境动态对用户-物品关联（即用户偏好）的影响。本文提出了一种将情境视为用户交互的前提条件的新视角。这个视角使我们能够将情境与用户/物品表示分开，并捕捉情境对用户-物品关系的影响，从而更全面地理解情境。基于此，我们提出了一种新型的面向情境的推荐增强器（SARE），",
