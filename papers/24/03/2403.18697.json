This work presents two new benchmarks to evaluate the models performance on mathematical understanding and language understanding in Italian. These benchmarks are based on real tests that are undertaken by students of age between 11 and 18 within the Italian school system and have therefore been validated by several experts in didactics and pedagogy.   To validate this dataset we evaluate the performance of 9 language models that are the best performing when writing in Italian, including our own fine-tuned models. We show that this is a challenging benchmark where current language models are bound by 60\\% accuracy.   We believe that the release of this dataset paves the way for impr",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管意大利语在所有指标上都是一种高资源语言，但目前并没有一种专门针对该语言进行预训练的语言模型。这导致了可用于评估意大利语语言模型性能的基准数目较少。本文提出了两个新的基准，用于评估模型在意大利语的数学理解和语言理解方面的性能。这些基准基于意大利学校系统内11至18岁学生进行的实际测试，并已由多位教学和教育学专家验证。",
