    "translated_abstract": "使用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行语义解析取得了显著成功，但在遇到幻觉时现有方法可靠性和效率方面存在不足。本文提出了一个名为QueryAgent的框架，通过逐步解决问题并进行逐步自我校正来解决这些挑战。我们引入了一种基于环境反馈的自我校正方法ERASER。与传统方法不同，ERASER利用中间步骤中的丰富环境反馈，在必要时仅进行选择性和差异化的自我校正。实验结果表明，QueryAgent在GrailQA和GraphQ上仅使用一个例子就比所有先前的少样本方法取得了7.0和15.0的F1值提升。此外，我们的方法在效率方面表现出优势，包括运行时间、查询开销和API调用成本。通过利用ERASER，",
