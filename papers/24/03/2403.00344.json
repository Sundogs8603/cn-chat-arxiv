Recent studies have reported encouraging results using deep reinforcement learning (RL) in the healthcare domain. Previous studies showed that assistive tasks can be formulated as multi-agent RL, wherein there are two agents: a caregiver and a care-receiver. However, policies trained in multi-agent RL are often sensitive to the policies of other agents. In such a case, a trained caregiver's policy may not work for different care-receivers. To alleviate this issue, we propose a framework that learns a robust caregiver's policy by training it for diverse care-receiver responses. In our framework, diverse care-receiver responses are autonomously learned through trials and errors. In addition, to robustify the care-giver's policy, we propose a strategy for sampling a care-receiver's response in an adversarial mann",
