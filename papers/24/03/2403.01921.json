The in-depth study manually analyses 133 ASA papers published in the English language between 2002 and 2020 from four academic databases (SAGE, IEEE, Springer, WILEY) and from Google Scholar. The in-breadth study uses modern, automatic machine learning techniques, such as topic modelling and temporal analysis, on Open Access resources, to reinforce themes and trends identified by the prior study, on 2297 ASA publications between 2010-2020.
