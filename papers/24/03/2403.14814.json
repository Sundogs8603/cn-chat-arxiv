    "translated_abstract": "全球心理健康问题的发生率正在上升，人们越来越意识到现有的心理保健模式无法充分扩展以满足需求。随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现，人们对它们具有创造新颖、大规模解决方案以支持心理健康的承诺感到乐观。尽管它们还处于初期阶段，LLMs已被应用于与心理健康相关的任务。本综述总结了已有文献中关于利用LLMs提供心理健康教育、评估和干预的努力，并突出了每个领域中产生积极影响的关键机会。然后，我们强调了将LLMs应用于心理健康领域所伴随的风险，并鼓励采用策略来减轻这些风险。对于心理健康支持的迫切需求必须与负责任的心理健康LLMs的开发、测试和部署相平衡。特别关键的是确保心理健康...",
