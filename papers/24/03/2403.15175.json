However, when additional structure, such as H\\\"{o}lder smoothness, is available then more accurate \"double cross-fit doubly robust\" (DCDR) estimators can be constructed by splitting the training data and undersmoothing nuisance function estimators on independent samples. We study a DCDR estimator of the Expected Conditional Covariance, a functional of interest in causal inference and conditional independence testing, and derive a series of increasingly powerful results with progressively stronger assumptions. We first provide a structure-agnostic error analysis for the DCDR estimator with no assumptions on the nuisance functions or their estimators.

    "translated_abstract": "具有跨拟合交叉的双稳健估计器因其良好的结构无关错误保证而在因果推断中备受青睐。然而，当存在额外结构，例如H\\\"{o}lder平滑时，可以通过在独立样本上对训练数据进行拆分和下调nuisance函数估计器来构建更精确的“双交叉固定双稳健”（DCDR）估计器。我们研究了预期条件协方差的DCDR估计器，在因果推断和条件独立性检验中是一个感兴趣的函数，并得出了一系列逐渐更强假设的结果。首先，我们对DCDR估计器提供无需对nuisance函数或它们的估计器做出假设的结构无关错误分析。然后，假设nuisance函数是H\\\"{o}lder平滑，但不假设知晓真实平滑级别或协变量密度。",
