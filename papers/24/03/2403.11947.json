    "translated_abstract": "随着能源转型的不断发展，需求侧灵活性成为现代电网的重要组成部分，为提供电网支持并促进可持续能源的进一步整合。除了传统能源来源外，住宅部门是另一个主要且尚未充分利用的灵活性来源，主要受到太阳能光伏、家庭电池和电动汽车的日益普及推动。然而，释放住宅这种能源灵活性具有挑战性，因为这需要一个可以有效管理家庭能源消耗并在保持用户舒适的同时能够在不同各种房屋之间容易扩展的控制框架。我们旨在解决这一具有挑战性的问题，并引入了一种使用可微分决策树的强化学习方法。该方法将数据驱动的强化学习的可伸缩性与可解释性的（可微分）决策树相结合。这样就产生了一个控制器，可以...",
