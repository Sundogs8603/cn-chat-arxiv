    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.00354v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the task of aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP), generative methods for predicting sentiment quads have shown promising results. However, they still suffer from imprecise predictions and limited interpretability, caused by data scarcity and inadequate modeling of the quadruplet composition process. In this paper, we propose Self-Consistent Reasoning-based Aspect-sentiment quadruple Prediction (SCRAP), optimizing its model to generate reasonings and the corresponding sentiment quadruplets in sequence. SCRAP adopts the Extract-Then-Assign reasoning strategy, which closely mimics human cognition. In the end, SCRAP significantly improves the model's ability to handle complex reasoning tasks and correctly predict quadruplets through consistency voting, resulting in enhanced interpretability and accuracy in ASQP.",

    "translated_abstract": "在方面情感四元预测（ASQP）任务中，用于预测情感四元的生成方法显示出了有希望的结果。然而，它们仍然受到不精确预测和有限可解释性的困扰，这是由数据稀缺性和四元组合成过程建模不足引起的。本文提出了自洽推理-基于方面情感四元预测（SCRAP），优化其模型以按顺序生成推理和相应的情感四元。 SCRAP采用提取-然后-分配推理策略，紧密模仿人类认知。最后，SCRAP通过一致性投票显著改善了模型处理复杂推理任务以及通过一致性投票正确预测四元组的能力，从而提高了ASQP中的可解释性和准确性。",
