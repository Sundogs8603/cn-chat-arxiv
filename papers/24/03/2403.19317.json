However, prior approaches mainly focused on training and evaluating these models within the same jurisdiction. In this study, we explore the cross-jurisdictional generalizability of legal case summarization models.Specifically, we explore how to effectively summarize legal cases of a target jurisdiction where reference summaries are not available. In particular, we investigate whether supplementing models with unlabeled target jurisdiction corpus and extractive silver summaries obtained from unsupervised algorithms on target data enhances transfer performance. Our comprehensive study on three datasets from different jurisdictions highlights the role of pre-training in improving transfer performance. We shed light on the pivotal influence of jurisdictional similarity in selecting optimal source",

    "translated_abstract": "法律专业人士面临管理海量冗长判决的挑战，自动化法律案例摘要变得至关重要。然而，先前的方法主要集中在同一司法管辖区内训练和评估这些模型。本研究探讨了法律案例摘要模型的跨辖区普适性。具体来说，我们探讨了如何有效地总结目标司法管辖区的法律案例，在那里参考摘要不可用。我们特别调查了用未标记的目标司法管辖区语料库和通过对目标数据使用无监督算法获得的抽取式银标摘要来补充模型是否增强了转移性能。我们对来自不同司法管辖区的三个数据集所进行的综合研究突显了预训练在提高转移性能方面的作用。我们揭示了在选择最佳来源时，司法相似性在起关键作用的影响。",
