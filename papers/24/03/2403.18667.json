Many current solutions leverage knowledge graphs to tackle these issues by combining both item-based and user-item collaborative signals. A common trend in these approaches focuses on improving ranking performance at the cost of escalating model complexity, reducing diversity, and complicating the task. It is essential to provide recommendations that are both personalized and diverse, rather than solely relying on achieving high rank-based performance, such as Click-through Rate, Recall, etc. In this paper, we propose a hybrid multi-task learning approach, training on user-item and item-item interactions.

    "translated_abstract": "处理与数据稀疏性、冷启动问题和推荐系统多样性相关的挑战既至关重要又具有挑战性。许多当前的解决方案利用知识图来解决这些问题，结合基于项目和用户-项目协作信号。这些方法的一个普遍趋势是专注于提高排名性能，但会增加模型复杂性、降低多样性并使任务变得更复杂。提供既个性化又多样化的推荐是至关重要的，而不仅仅依赖于实现高排名性能，比如点击率、召回率等。本文提出了一种混合多任务学习方法，通过在用户-项目和项目-项目交互上进行训练。我们在描述性文本上应用基于项目的对比学习，根据项目元数据对正负样本进行抽样。我们的方法使模型能更好地理解关系",
