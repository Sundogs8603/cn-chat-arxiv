    "translated_abstract": "现有的神经响应生成模型已经在双方对话方面取得了令人瞩目的进展，假设话语是按顺序组织的。然而，许多现实世界中的对话涉及多方参与者，对话上下文的结构要复杂得多，例如，来自不同参与者的话语可能“并行”发生。面对这一挑战，有研究致力于建模话语或参与者之间的关系，以便以更清晰的上下文进行响应生成。然而，这些方法严重依赖这些关系，都假设这些关系是预先给定的，这在实践中是不切实际的，也妨碍了这些方法的普适性。在这项工作中，我们建议通过对话上下文中微妙线索进行关系推断，引导神经响应生成，而无需任何人工标签。具体而言，我们首先通过关系思维自动推断出这些关系，然后利用这些关系来指导神经响应生成。",
