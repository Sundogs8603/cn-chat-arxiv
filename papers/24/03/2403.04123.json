    "translated_abstract": "云软件系统越来越复杂，导致事件管理已成为软件开发生命周期的一个重要组成部分。根本原因分析（RCA）是事件管理过程的关键部分，对值班工程师来说是一项严峻的任务，需要深入的领域知识和对团队特定服务的广泛经验。自动化RCA可以显著节省时间，并减轻值班工程师在事件管理上的负担。最近，研究人员利用大型语言模型（LLMs）执行RCA，并取得了令人期待的成果。然而，这些方法无法动态收集额外的诊断信息，如与事件相关的日志、指标或数据库，严重限制了它们诊断根本原因的能力。在这项工作中，我们探讨了LLM代理用于RCA以解决此限制的使用。我们提出了一项彻底的实证评估。",
