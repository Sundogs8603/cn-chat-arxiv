    "translated_abstract": "目标检测器通常表现不佳于与其训练集不同的数据。最近，领域自适应目标检测（DAOD）方法已经展示了在应对这一挑战上的强大结果。遗憾的是，我们发现了系统化的基准测试陷阱，这些陷阱对过去的结果提出质疑并阻碍了进一步的进展：（a）由于基线不足导致性能高估，（b）不一致的实现实践阻止了方法的透明比较，（c）由于过时的骨干和基准测试缺乏多样性，导致缺乏普遍性。我们通过引入以下问题来解决这些问题：（1）一个统一的基准测试和实现框架，Align and Distill（ALDI），支持DAOD方法的比较并支持未来发展，（2）一个公平且现代的DAOD训练和评估协议，解决了基准测试的陷阱，（3）一个新的DAOD基准数据集，CFC-DAOD，能够在多样化的真实环境中进行评估。",
