    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.03863v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, few-shot and zero-shot learning, which learn to predict labels with limited annotated instances, have garnered significant attention. Traditional approaches often treat frequent-shot (freq-shot; labels with abundant instances), few-shot, and zero-shot learning as distinct challenges, optimizing systems for just one of these scenarios. Yet, in real-world settings, label occurrences vary greatly. Some of them might appear thousands of times, while others might only appear sporadically or not at all. For practical deployment, it is crucial that a system can adapt to any label occurrence. We introduce a novel classification challenge: X-shot, reflecting a real-world context where freq-shot, few-shot, and zero-shot labels co-occur without predefined limits. Here, X can span from 0 to positive infinity. The crux of X-shot centers on open-domain generalization and devising a system versatile enough to manage various label scena",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，少样本和零样本学习引起了人们的极大关注，传统方法通常将频繁出现、少样本和零样本学习视为不同的挑战，仅为其中一种情况优化系统。然而，在真实世界的环境中，标签出现的频率差异很大。为了实现实际部署，关键在于系统能够适应任何标签出现。我们引入了一个新颖的分类挑战：X-shot，反映了一个实际环境，其中频繁出现、少样本和零样本标签在没有预定义限制的情况下共同出现。在这里，X可以从0到正无穷大。X-shot的关键在于开放领域泛化和设计一个足够灵活的系统来管理各种标签情景。",
