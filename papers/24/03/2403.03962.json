    "translated_abstract": "在网络中识别关键节点是一个经典的决策任务，许多方法在可适应性和效用之间难以取得平衡。因此，我们提出了一种方法，将进化算法（EA）与大型语言模型（LLMs）相结合，生成一个名为“score_nodes”的函数，该函数可以进一步用于根据其分配的分数识别关键节点。我们的模型包括三个主要组成部分：手动初始化、群体管理和基于LLMs的进化。它从最初的人口群体中演化出一组手动创建的设计节点评分函数。LLMs利用其强大的上下文理解能力和丰富的编程技能对个体执行交叉和突变操作，生成出色的新函数。然后对这些函数进行分类、排名和消除，以确保群体的稳定发展同时保持多样性。",
