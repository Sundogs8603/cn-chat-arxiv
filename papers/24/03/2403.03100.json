Considering speech intricately encompasses various attributes (e.g., content, prosody, timbre, and acoustic details) that pose significant challenges for generation, a natural idea is to factorize speech into individual subspaces representing different attributes and generate them individually. Motivated by it, we propose NaturalSpeech 3, a TTS system with novel factorized diffusion models to generate natural speech in a zero-shot way. Specifically, 1) we design a neural codec with factorized vector quantization (FVQ) to disentangle speech waveform into subspaces of content, prosody, timbre, and acoustic details; 2) we propose a factorized diffusion model to generate attributes in each subspace following its corresponding prompt.

    "translated_abstract": "近期大规模文本到语音（TTS）模型取得了显著进展，然而在语音质量、相似度和韵律方面仍存在不足。鉴于语音复杂地包含各种属性（例如内容、韵律、音色和声学细节），给生成带来了重大挑战，一个自然的想法是将语音因子分解为代表不同属性的各个子空间，并单独生成它们。在此基础上，我们提出了NaturalSpeech 3，这是一个具有新颖的分解扩散模型的TTS系统，可以以零-shot方式生成自然语音。具体来说，1) 我们设计了一个具有分解向量量化（FVQ）的神经编解码器，将语音波形分解为内容、韵律、音色和声学细节的子空间；2) 我们提出了一个分解扩散模型，根据其相应的提示生成每个子空间中的属性。借助这种分解设计，NaturalSpeech 3能够ef",
