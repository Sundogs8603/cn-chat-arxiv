This paper delves into the complexities of AI's role in Education, addressing the mixed messages that have both enthused and alarmed educators, policymakers, and the public. It explores the promises that AI holds for enhancing learning through personalisation at scale, against the backdrop of concerns about ethical implications, the devaluation of non-STEM subjects, and the potential transformative impact on our neurocognitive and socio-emotional functioning. Drawing on recent research and global discourse, the paper seeks to unpack the reasons behind the vagueness of current discussions on AI in Education (AIED) and the implications of this ambiguity for future educational practices and policies.

    "translated_abstract": "关于人工智能（AI）的当前讨论在希望和忧虑之间摇摆，描绘了一个未来，AI将重塑人类生活的方方面面，包括教育。本文深入探讨了AI在教育中的角色复杂性，解决了同时激励和警示教育工作者、决策者和公众的矛盾信息。它探讨了AI为通过规模化个性化提升学习所持有的承诺，同时也关注了伦理影响、非STEM学科的贬值以及对我们的神经认知和社会情感功能潜在转变影响的背景。借鉴最新研究和全球讨论，本文试图揭示当前AI在教育领域（AIED）讨论的模糊性背后的原因，以及这种不确定性对未来教育实践和政策的影响。",
