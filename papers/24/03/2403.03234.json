    "translated_abstract": "大规模序列建模引发了快速进展，现在扩展至生物学和基因组学。然而，建模基因组序列引入了挑战，如需要建模长范围片段相互作用，基因组上游和下游区域的影响，以及 DNA 的反向互补性（RC）。在这里，我们提出了一个受这些挑战启发的架构，它基于长范围的 Mamba 块，将其扩展为支持双向性的 BiMamba 组件，以及支持 RC 等变性的 MambaDNA 块。我们以 MambaDNA 为基础，创造了 Caduceus，第一个支持 RC 等变性的双向长范围 DNA 语言模型系列，我们介绍了预训练和微调策略，生成了 Caduceus DNA 基础模型。Caduceus 在下游基准测试中胜过以前的长范围模型；在具有挑战性的长范围变异效应预测任务上，Caduceus 超越了该任务。",
