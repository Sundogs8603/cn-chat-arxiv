    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.20039v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study explored the variability in Aggregate Personal Income (PI) across 13 major industrial sectors in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing time-series data from 2010 Q1 to 2019 Q4, we employed Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models to establish baseline trends in Personal Income (PI) before the pandemic. We then extended these models to forecast PI values for the subsequent 14 quarters, from 2020 Q1 to 2023 Q2, as if the pandemic had never happened. This forecasted data was compared with the actual PI data collected during the pandemic to quantify its impacts. This approach allowed for the assessment of both immediate and extended effects of COVID-19 on sector-specific PI. Our study highlighted the resilience of PI in sectors like Utilities, Retail, Finance, Real Estate, and Healthcare, with Farming showing an early recovery in PI, despite significant initial setbacks. In contrast, PI in Accommodation and",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了在COVID-19大流行期间美国13个主要产业部门中的个人收入总额的变异性。利用2010年Q1至2019年Q4的时间序列数据，我们利用自回归综合移动平均（ARIMA）模型来建立疫情前个人收入的基线趋势。然后，我们将这些模型延伸到预测接下来14个季度（从2020年Q1到2023年Q2）的个人收入价值，就好像疫情从未发生过一样。预测数据与疫情期间实际收集的个人收入数据进行比较，以量化其影响。这种方法允许评估COVID-19对特定部门个人收入的即时和长期影响。我们的研究强调了公用事业、零售、金融、房地产和医疗保健等部门的个人收入的弹性，农业部门尽管最初受到重大打击，但个人收入表现出较早的恢复。与此相反，住宿业和...",
