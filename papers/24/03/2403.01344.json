    "translated_abstract": "持续测试时间自适应（CTA）是一项具有挑战性的任务，旨在将源预训练模型适应不断变化的目标域。在CTA设置中，模型不知道目标领域何时发生变化，因此在测试时间面临流输入分布的剧烈变化。关键挑战在于以在线方式持续地调整模型以适应不断变化的目标领域。我们发现，模型在不断适应目标数据的分布时会呈现高度偏倚的预测。它更频繁地预测某些类别，而这导致了错误的过度自信的预测。本文通过缓解这一问题来提高CTA场景中的性能。为了减轻偏差问题，我们利用可靠的目标样本制定以类别为基础的指数加权移动平均目标原型，并利用它们以类别方式对目标特征进行聚类。此外，我们还旨在对齐目标领域",
