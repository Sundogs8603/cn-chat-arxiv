While most of the existing counterfactual methods explain a single instance, several real-world use cases, such as customer satisfaction, require the identification of a single counterfactual that can satisfy multiple instances (e.g. customers) simultaneously. In this work, we propose a flexible two-stage algorithm for finding groups of instances along with cost-efficient multi-instance counterfactual explanations. This is motivated by the fact that in most previous works the aspect of finding such groups is not addressed.",

    "translated_abstract": "反事实解释是分析黑盒系统预测结果的最流行方法之一，因为它可以推荐成本有效且可操作的输入更改，将不良系统输出转变为期望输出。大多数现有的反事实方法解释单个实例，但一些真实的用例（如客户满意度）需要识别能同时满足多个实例（例如客户）的单一反事实。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种灵活的两阶段算法，用于找到实例组以及成本有效的多实例反事实解释。这是因为在大多数先前的工作中，找到这样的实例组并未得到充分解决的。",
