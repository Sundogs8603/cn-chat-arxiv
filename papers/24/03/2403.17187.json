The first approach requires no riskless asset. We develop the general framework for this approach and illustrate it with two specific examples. The second approach does use a riskless asset. However, by ensuring equality between real-world and risk-neutral price-change probabilities, the second approach enables the computation of risk-neutral option prices utilizing expectations under the natural world probability P. This produces the same option prices as the classical approach in which prices are computed under the risk neutral measure Q. The second approach and the two specific examples of the first approach require the introduction of new, marketable asset types, specifically perpetual derivatives of a stock, and a stock whose cumulative return (rather than price) is deflated.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了两种替代套利免费、市场完备的期权定价方法。第一种方法不需要无风险资产。我们为这种方法制定了一般性框架，并用两个具体例子进行了说明。第二种方法使用了无风险资产。然而，通过确保现实世界和风险中性价格变动概率之间的相等，第二种方法使得可以利用自然世界概率P下的期望来计算风险中性期权价格。这产生了与经典方法中利用风险中性测度Q下计算价格相同的期权价格。第二种方法和第一种方法的两个具体例子需要引入新的、可交易的资产类型，具体来说是股票的永续衍生品和一个累积回报（而不是价格）被折算的股票。",
