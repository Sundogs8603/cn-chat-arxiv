    "translated_abstract": "动作质量评估（AQA）应用计算机视觉定量评估人类动作的表现或执行。当前的AQA方法是端到端的神经模型，缺乏透明度并且易受偏见，因为它们是基于主观人类判断作为地面真相进行训练的。为了解决这些问题，我们介绍了一种用于AQA的神经符号范式，该方法使用神经网络从视频数据中抽象出可解释的符号，并通过将规则应用于这些符号进行质量评估。我们以跳水为案例研究。我们发现领域专家更喜欢我们的系统，并发现其比纯神经方法更具信息量。我们的系统还实现了最先进的动作识别和时间分割，并自动生成了一份详细报告，将跳水分解为其元素，并提供带有视觉证据的客观评分。经一组领域专家验证，",
