    "translated_abstract": "安全多智体强化学习（safe MARL）在最近几年逐渐受到关注，强调了智体不仅需要优化全局回报，还需要通过行为约束遵守安全要求的必要性。近期一些工作将控制理论与多智体强化学习相结合，以解决确保安全性的挑战。然而，在这一领域中应用模型预测控制（MPC）方法的应用非常有限，主要是由于多智体环境中复杂且隐式动态的特性。为弥合这一差距，我们提出了一种称为基于深度学习的安全多智体强化学习模型预测控制（DeepSafeMPC）的新方法。DeepSafeMPC 的关键见解是利用集中式深度学习模型很好地预测环境动态。我们的方法应用MARL原则来寻找最优解。",
