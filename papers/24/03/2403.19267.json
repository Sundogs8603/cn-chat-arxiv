We propose a multi-agent Minecraft simulator, MineLand, that bridges this gap by introducing limited multimodal senses and physical needs. Our simulator supports up to 48 agents with limited visual, auditory, and environmental awareness, forcing them to actively communicate and collaborate to fulfill physical needs like food and resources. This fosters dynamic and valid multi-agent interactions. We further introduce an AI agent framework, Alex, inspired by multitasking theory, enabling agents to handle intricate coordination and scheduling. Our experiments demonstrate that the simulator, the corresponding benchmark, and the AI agent framework contribute to more ecological and nuanced collective behavior. The source code of MineLand and Alex is openly available at https://github.com/c",

    "translated_abstract": "传统的多智能体仿真器通常假设拥有完美信息和无限功能，这限制了社会互动的生态有效性。我们提出了一个多智能体Minecraft模拟器MineLand，通过引入有限的多模感知和生理需求来弥合这一差距。我们的仿真器支持最多48个具有有限视觉、听觉和环境意识的智能体，迫使它们积极沟通和协作以满足食物和资源等生理需求。这促进了动态和有效的多智能体交互。我们进一步介绍了一个灵感来自多任务处理理论的AI智能体框架Alex，使智能体能够处理复杂的协调和调度。我们的实验表明，该模拟器、相应的基准测试和AI智能体框架有助于更具生态和细致的集体行为。MineLand和Alex的源代码可以在https://github.com/c中公开获取。",
