    "translated_abstract": "优化指标对于构建大规模推荐系统至关重要。然而，一种实用的有效和高效指标仍然难以找到。尽管Top-K排名指标是优化的黄金标准，但它们存在着显着的计算开销。相比之下，更高效的准确性和AUC指标往往无法捕捉推荐任务的真正目标，导致性能亚优。为了克服这一困境，我们提出了一种新的优化指标，Lower-Left Partial AUC（LLPAUC），它在计算效率上类似于AUC，但与Top-K排名指标强相关。与AUC相比，LLPAUC仅考虑ROC曲线下方的局部区域，以将优化焦点放在Top-K上。我们提供了LLPAUC与Top-K排名指标之间的相关性的理论验证，并展示了其对嘈杂用户反馈的稳健性。",
