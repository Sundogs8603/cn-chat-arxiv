Previous explorations in sample selection have been demonstrated as an effective way for robust learning with noisy labels, however, the conventional studies focus on i.i.d data, and when moving to non-iid graph data and GNNs, two notable challenges remain: (1) nodes located near topological class boundaries are very informative for classification but cannot be successfully distinguished by the heuristic sample selection.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管精心注释的基准测试取得了成功，但当现实世界的图数据带有噪声标签时，现有图神经网络（GNNs）的有效性在实践中可能会受到相当大的影响。以往在样本选择方面的探索已被证明是一种有效的应对噪声标签的鲁棒学习方法，然而，传统研究侧重于i.i.d数据，当转向非独立同分布的图数据和GNNs时，仍然存在两个值得关注的挑战：(1) 位于拓扑类边界附近的节点对分类非常有信息量，但无法通过启发式样本选择成功区分。(2) 没有可用的衡量标准考虑图的拓扑信息以促进图中的样本选择。为了解决这一困境，我们提出了一种$“\\textit{拓扑样本选择}$（TSS）”方法，通过利用拓扑信息来提升图中信息丰富的样本选择过程。",
