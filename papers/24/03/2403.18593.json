    "translated_abstract": "标记器作为大型模型的基本组件之一，长期以来在视觉任务中被忽视甚至误解。大语言模型具有强大理解能力的一个关键因素是自然语言标记器利用有意义的词或子词作为语言的基本元素。相比之下，以基于补丁的方法如Patch Embed为代表的主流视觉标记器依赖于无意义的矩形补丁作为视觉的基本元素，这不能像语言中的词或子词一样有效地发挥作用。从标记器的本质出发，我们为视觉定义了语义独立区域（SIRs）。我们设计了一个简单的HOmogeneous视觉tOKenizer: HOOK。HOOK主要由两个模块组成：物体感知模块（OPM）和物体矢量化模块（OVM）。为实现均匀性，OPM将图像分割为4*4像素种子，然后利用注意力机制来。",
