    "translated_abstract": "基于图的异常检测是图神经网络（GNNs）领域中一个重要的研究课题。我们发现，在图异常检测中，不同类别之间的同质性分布差异显著大于同质性和异质性图中的差异。我们首次引入了一个称为类同质性方差的新度量，定量描述了这一现象。为了减轻其影响，我们提出了一种名为同质性边生成图神经网络（HedGe）的新型GNN模型。以前的研究通常侧重于对原始关系进行修剪、选择或连接，我们称这些方法为修改。与这些工作不同，我们的方法强调生成新的关系，使类同质性方差较低，同时使用原始关系作为辅助。HedGe使用自关注机制从头开始对同质性邻接矩阵进行采样，并利用...",
