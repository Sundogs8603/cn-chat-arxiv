    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络(GNNs)是各种结构学习应用的强大解决方案，因为它们对图数据的表示能力强大。然而，传统的GNNs依赖于仅从一阶邻居（即正样本）收集信息的消息传递机制，可能导致过度平滑和过度压缩等问题。为了缓解这些问题，我们提出了一种用于消息传递传播的层多样负采样方法。该方法在确定性点过程中使用了一个采样矩阵，将候选集转换为一个空间，并从该空间选择性地对其进行采样以生成负样本。为了在每个前向传播过程中进一步增强负样本的多样性，我们开发了一种空间压缩方法，以实现多层GNNs中的逐层多样性。各种真实世界图数据集上的实验证明了我们方法的有效性。",
