    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.10558v1 公告类型: 跨领域 摘要: 在训练人脸识别（FR）模型中利用个人敏感数据存在重大的隐私问题，因为对手可以利用模型反演攻击（MIA）推断出原始训练数据。现有的防御方法，如数据增强和差分隐私，已被用来减轻这一问题。然而，这些方法往往无法在隐私和准确性之间达到最佳平衡。为解决这一局限性，本文介绍了一种针对MIA的自适应混合遮盖算法。具体地，在频域中使用自适应的MixUp策略对人脸图像进行遮盖。与主要用于数据增强的传统MixUp算法不同，我们修改的方法融合了频域混合。先前的研究表明，增加MixUp中混合的图像数量可以增强隐私保护，但会降低人脸识别的准确性。为了解决这一问题，",
