    "translated_abstract": "机器学习的进步推动了地球观测数据在气候变化研究中的应用。然而，机器学习表示的可解释性仍然是一个挑战，尤其是在理解森林对气候变化的生物物理反应方面。遥感中传统的逆辐射传输模型（RTMs）来从光谱数据中恢复生物物理变量的方法通常无法考虑RTM本身固有的偏倚，尤其是对于复杂的森林。我们建议将RTMs集成到自动编码器架构中，创建一个端到端学习方法。我们的方法不仅纠正了RTMs中的偏倚，而且在变量恢复方面优于神经网络回归等传统技术。此外，我们的框架在逆转偏倚的物理模型方面具有潜在的一般性。代码可在https://github.com/yihshe/ai-refined-rtm.git上获得。",
