To this end, it is critical for such dialogue systems to plan reasonable actions to drive the conversation proactively, and meanwhile, to plan appropriate topics to move the conversation forward to the target topic smoothly. In this work, we mainly focus on effective dialogue planning for target-oriented dialogue generation. Inspired by decision-making theories in cognitive science, we propose a novel target-constrained bidirectional planning (TRIP) approach, which plans an appropriate dialogue path by looking ahead and looking back. By formulating the planning as a generation task, our TRIP bidirectionally generates a dialogue path consisting of a sequence of  pairs using two Transformer decoders. They are expected to supervis",

    "translated_abstract": "面向目标导向的主动对话系统旨在引导对话从对话上下文向预定目标发展，比如在指定项目上进行推荐或介绍新的特定主题。为此，对话系统关键在于计划合理的行动以主动推动对话，并同时计划适当的主题以顺利推进对话到目标话题。本文主要关注于面向目标导向对话生成的有效对话规划。受认知科学中决策理论的启发，我们提出了一种新颖的目标受限双向规划（TRIP）方法，通过前向和后向规划一个适当的对话路径。通过将规划形式化为一项生成任务，我们的TRIP双向生成了一个由一系列pair组成的对话路径，使用了两个Transformer解码器。它们被预期用于监督",
