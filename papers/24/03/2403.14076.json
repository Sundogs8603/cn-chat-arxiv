    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种使用归一化流进行领域自适应的新应用。该研究调查了基于流的神经网络改进CLAS12中$\\Lambda$超子信号提取的能力。归一化流可以帮助建模描述物理过程的复杂概率密度函数，实现事件生成等用途。虽然通过使用分类器网络改进了$\\Lambda$信号提取，但模拟和数据领域的差异限制了分类器性能；该研究利用流进行蒙特卡罗模拟和数据之间的领域自适应。我们成功训练了一个流网络，将隐含的物理空间转换为正态分布。我们还发现应用流减少了merit图表对分类器输出切割线的依赖性，这意味着存在更广泛的范围，在该范围内切割会产生类似的merit图表。",
