    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了针对人群导航找到混合策略纳什均衡的问题。混合策略纳什均衡为机器人提供了一个严谨的模型，使其能够预测人群中不确定但合作的人类行为，但计算成本通常太高，无法进行可扩展和实时的决策制定。在这里，我们证明了一个简单的迭代贝叶斯更新方案收敛于混合策略社交导航游戏的纳什均衡。此外，我们提出了一个基于数据驱动的框架，通过将代理策略初始化为从人类数据集学习的高斯过程，来构建该游戏。基于所提出的混合策略纳什均衡模型，我们开发了一个基于采样的人群导航框架，可以集成到现有导航方法中，并可在笔记本电脑 CPU 上实时运行。我们通过模拟环境和真实世界的非结构化环境中人类数据集对我们的框架进行了评估。",
