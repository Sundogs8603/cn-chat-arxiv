We first provide a canonical class of mechanisms for these settings. The key idea is to treat the submission of hard information as an observable and payoff-relevant action and the contractible part of the mechanism as a mapping from submitted scores to a distribution over decisions (a score-based decision rule). Each type report triggers a distribution over score submission requests and a distribution over decision rules.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个机制设计框架，该框架同时整合了可以自由操纵的软信息和需要付出成本才能篡改的半硬信息。该框架涵盖了诸如学校选择、公共住房、器官移植和分类算法操作等各种情境。我们首先为这些设置提供了一个经典的机制类。关键思想是将硬信息的提交视为可观察且与回报相关的行动，将机制的可契约部分视为从提交的分数到决策分布的映射（基于得分的决策规则）。每种类型的报告触发一个分数提交请求分布和一个决策规则分布。我们提供了基于分数的机制无损失的条件。换句话说，代理商在没有任何类型报告的情况下并且在没有中介者的情况下决定。",
