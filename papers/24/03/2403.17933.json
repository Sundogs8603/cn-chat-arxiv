    "translated_abstract": "SLEDGE是第一个基于真实世界驾驶记录训练的车辆运动规划生成模拟器。其核心组件是一个学习模型，能够生成智能体边界框和车道图。该模型的输出作为交通模拟的初始状态。针对SLEDGE待生成的实体的独特特性，例如它们的连接性和每个场景的可变数量，使得大多数现代生成模型在这一任务上的朴素应用变得不简单。因此，我们除了对现有车道图表示进行系统研究外，还引入了一种新颖的栅格到矢量自编码器（RVAE）。它将智能体和车道图编码为栅格化潜在映射中的不同通道。这有助于车道条件下的智能体生成以及使用扩散变换器同时生成车道和智能体。在SLEDGE中使用生成的实体可以更好地控制模拟，例如上采样转弯。",
