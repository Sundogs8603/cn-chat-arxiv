    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习(FL)是一种流行的算法，用于在用户数据受限于边缘设备(例如，移动电话)上训练机器学习模型，这是由于隐私问题。通常，FL在训练时假设用户数据的任何部分都不能从边缘流出。然而，在许多生产环境中，特定的数据模态/元数据被限制在设备上，而其他数据不受限制。例如，在商业SLU系统中，通常希望防止将生物识别信号(例如输入提示的音频记录)传输到云端，但可能将本地(即在边缘设备上)转录的文本传输到云端。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种名为部分联邦学习(PartialFL)的新算法，该算法使用数据训练机器学习模型，其中数据模态的子集或其中间表示可以向服务器提供。",
