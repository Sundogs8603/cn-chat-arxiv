    "translated_abstract": "当在代理SVARs中，VAR扰动的协方差矩阵受到外生、永久、非重复性突破的影响，从而产生随着波动率体制变化而变化的目标脉冲响应函数(IRFs)时，即使是强大的外生外部工具也可能导致对所感兴趣的动态因果效应的估计值不一致，如果不适当考虑这些突破。在这种情况下，必须明确地将无条件波动的变化纳入考虑，以便点辨识出目标结构冲击并可能恢复一致性。我们证明，在利用波动性变化所暗示的瞬时时刻的必要充分秩条件下，目标IRFs可以被点辨识并一致估计。重要的是，标准渐近推断在这种情况下仍然是有效的，尽管(I)代理和被工具化的结构性冲击之间的协方差是接近于零，就像Stai中的情况一样。",
