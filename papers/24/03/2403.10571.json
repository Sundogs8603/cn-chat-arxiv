This article introduces JaxDecompiler, a tool that transforms any JAX function into an editable Python code, especially useful for editing the JAX function generated by the gradient function. JaxDecompiler simplifies the processes of reverse engineering, understanding, customizing, and interoperability of software developed by JAX. We highlight its capabilities, emphasize its practical applications especially in deep learning and more generally gradient-informed software, and demonstrate that the decompiled code speed performance is similar to the original.",

    "translated_abstract": "在能够计算梯度下降优化的数值库中，JAX以其提供更多功能而脱颖而出，其加速效果来自一个名为Jaxpr语言的中间表示。然而，直接编辑Jaxpr代码是不可能的。本文介绍了JaxDecompiler，一种将任何JAX函数转换为可编辑Python代码的工具，特别适用于编辑由梯度函数生成的JAX函数。JaxDecompiler简化了通过JAX开发的软件的反向工程、理解、定制和互操作的过程。我们突出了它的功能，强调了它在深度学习和更一般的基于梯度信息的软件中的实际应用，并且证明了反编译代码的速度性能与原始代码的相似性。",
