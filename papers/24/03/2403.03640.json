To extend the reach of medical AI advancements to a broader population, we aim to develop medical LLMs across the six most widely spoken languages, encompassing a global population of 6.1 billion. This effort culminates in the creation of the ApolloCorpora multilingual medical dataset and the XMedBench benchmark. In the multilingual medical benchmark, the released Apollo models, at various relatively-small sizes (i.e., 0.5B, 1.8B, 2B, 6B, and 7B), achieve the best performance among models of equivalent size. Especially, Apollo-7B is the state-of-the-art multilingual medical LLMs up to 70B. Additionally, these lite models could be used to improve the multi-lingual medical capabilities of larger models without fine-tuning in a",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管全球医学知识的庞大存储库主要是以英语为主，但在传递量身定制医疗服务方面，本地语言对于在医疗资源有限的地区尤为重要。为了将医学人工智能的进展扩展到更广泛的人群，我们旨在开发涵盖全球61亿人口的六种最常用语言的医学LLMs。这一努力最终促成了ApolloCorpora多语言医学数据集和XMedBench基准的创建。在多语言医学基准测试中，发布的Apollo模型，在各种相对较小尺寸（即0.5B、1.8B、2B、6B和7B）上取得了与同等大小模型最佳性能。特别地，Apollo-7B是迄今为止达到70B的最先进的多语言医学LLMs。此外，这些轻量级模型可用于在不需要微调的情况下改进较大模型的多语言医学能力。",
