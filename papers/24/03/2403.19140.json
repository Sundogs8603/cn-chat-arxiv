    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型在图像合成领域引起了革命，建立了质量和创造力的新基准。然而，它们在迭代去噪过程中需要的密集计算阻碍了它们的广泛采用。后训练量化（PTQ）提供了一种解决方案，可以加速采样，尽管以低比特设置极大降低了样本质量。针对这一问题，我们的研究引入了一个统一的量化噪声校正方案（QNCD），旨在减小整个采样过程中的量化噪声。我们确定了两个主要的量化挑战：内部和外部量化噪声。内部量化噪声主要由于嵌入在resblock模块中而加剧，扩展了激活量化范围，在每个单独的去噪步骤中增加了干扰。此外，外部量化噪声源自整个去噪过程中的累积量化偏差，改变了数据分布。",
