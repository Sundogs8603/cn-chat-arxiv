    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.17286v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: When interacting with information retrieval (IR) systems, users, affected by confirmation biases, tend to select search results that confirm their existing beliefs on socially significant contentious issues. To understand the judgments and attitude changes of users searching online, our study examined how cognitively biased users interact with algorithmically biased search engine result pages (SERPs). We designed three-query search sessions on debated topics under various bias conditions. We recruited 1,321 crowdsourcing participants and explored their attitude changes, search interactions, and the effects of confirmation bias. Three key findings emerged: 1) most attitude changes occur in the initial query of a search session; 2) confirmation bias and result presentation on SERPs affect search behaviors in the current query and perceived familiarity with clicked results in subsequent queries. The bias position also affect attitude change",

    "translated_abstract": "当用户与信息检索(IR)系统交互时，受到确认偏见影响，往往选择确认他们在社会重要争议问题上的现有信念的搜索结果。为了理解在线搜索用户的判断和态度变化，我们的研究考察了认知偏误用户如何与算法性偏误的搜索引擎结果页面(SERPs)互动。我们设计了在不同偏差条件下的争议性话题上的三次查询搜索会话。我们招募了1,321名众包参与者，探讨了他们的态度变化、搜索互动以及确认偏误的影响。我们得出了三个关键发现：1) 大多数态度变化发生在搜索会话的初始查询中；2) 确认偏误和SERPs上的结果呈现影响当前查询中的搜索行为以及之后查询中点击结果的感知熟悉度。偏误立场也影响态度变化。",
    "tldr": "用户在与算法偏误的搜索结果互动时，受认知偏误影响，特别是在有争议话题上的整个搜索过程中，他们更倾向于选择符合其现有信念的结果，并且确认偏误和结果呈现对搜索行为和结果熟悉度有显著影响。",
    "en_tdlr": "Users interacting with algorithmically biased search results are influenced by cognitive biases, especially in the whole search process on controversial topics, where they tend to select results that confirm their existing beliefs, and confirmation bias and result presentation significantly affect search behaviors and result familiarity."
