Using systematic reviews as a baseline, and publication data from the NIH Open Citation Collection, we compare the performance of the three citation-based approaches direct citation, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling with respect to recall and precision measures. In addition, we include the PubMed Related Article score as well as combined approaches in the comparison. We also provide a fairly comprehensive review of earlier research in which citation relations have been used for information retrieval purposes. The results show an advantage for co-citation over bibliographic coupling and direct citation. However, combining the three approaches outperforms the exclusive use of co-citation in the study. The results further indicate, in line with previous research, that combining citation-based approaches with textual approaches en",

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我们探讨了基于种子的研究出版物网络信息检索。使用系统评审作为基准，结合NIH开放引文收集的出版数据，我们比较了三种基于引文的方法——直接引用、共同引用和文献耦合在召回率和精确率方面的表现。此外，我们还将PubMed相关文章得分以及组合方法纳入比较。我们还对先前使用引文关系进行信息检索的早期研究进行了相当全面的回顾。结果显示共同引用优于文献耦合和直接引用。然而，在研究中，将这三种方法组合起来胜过仅使用共同引用。结果进一步表明，与先前研究一致，将基于引文的方法与文本方法相结合",
