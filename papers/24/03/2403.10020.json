Watermarking methods, particularly logit-based approaches, embed imperceptible identifiers into text to address these challenges. However, the widespread use of watermarking across diverse LLMs has led to an inevitable issue known as watermark collision during common tasks like question answering and paraphrasing. This study focuses on dual watermark collisions, where two watermarks are present simultaneously in the same text. The research demonstrates that watermark collision poses a threat to detection performance for detectors of both upstream and downstream watermark algorithms.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成内容方面的普及，引发了关于文本版权的担忧。水印方法，特别是基于logit的方法，将不可察觉的标识嵌入文本中，以解决这些挑战。然而，水印方法在不同LLMs上的广泛应用导致了一种不可避免的问题，即在常见任务（如问答和改写）中发生的水印冲突。本研究关注双水印冲突，即同一文本中同时存在两个水印的情况。研究表明，水印冲突对上游和下游水印算法的检测器的检测性能构成威胁。",
