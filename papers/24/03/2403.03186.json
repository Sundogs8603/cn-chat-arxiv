However, existing agents cannot generalize across different scenarios, mainly due to their diverse observation and action spaces and semantic gaps, or reliance on task-specific resources. In this work, we propose the General Computer Control (GCC) setting: building foundation agents that can master any computer task by taking only screen images (and possibly audio) of the computer as input, and producing keyboard and mouse operations as output, similar to human-computer interaction. To target GCC, we propose Cradle, an agent framework with strong reasoning abilities, including self-reflection, task inference, and skill curation, to ensure generalizability and self-improvement across various tasks.

    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，基于基金的代理在特定任务或场景中取得了成功。然而，现有代理无法跨不同场景泛化，主要是由于它们多样化的观察和行动空间以及语义差距，或依赖于特定任务的资源。在这项工作中，我们提出了通用计算机控制（GCC）设置：通过仅获取计算机的屏幕图像（以及可能的音频）作为输入，并产生键盘和鼠标操作作为输出，类似于人机交互，构建可以精通任何计算机任务的基金代理。为了针对GCC，我们提出了Cradle，一个代理框架，具有强大的推理能力，包括自我反思、任务推理和技能整理，以确保在各种任务中的泛化和自我改进。为了展示Cradle的能力，我们将其部署在复杂的AAA游戏《荒野大镖客2》中，作为通向G的初步尝试。",
