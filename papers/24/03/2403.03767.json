    "translated_abstract": "表面活性剂分子的临界胶束浓度（CMC）是工业中表面活性剂应用中的基本性质。最近，经典的QSPR和图神经网络（GNN）作为一种深度学习技术已成功应用于预测室温下表面活性剂的CMC。然而，这些模型尚未考虑CMC的温度依赖性，这对于实际应用非常重要。本文开发了一个用于预测表面活性剂温度依赖CMC的GNN模型。我们从公共来源收集了大约1400个不同温度下的各类表面活性剂（即离子性，非离子性和带电离子性）的数据点。我们测试了模型的预测质量，分别考虑以下情况：i）当训练模型时至少有一个不同温度下的表面活性剂CMC数据存在于训练集中，和ii）当模型的训练集中没有表面活性剂的CMC数据，即泛化到未见数据的情况。",
