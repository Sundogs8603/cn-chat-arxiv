Based on daily stock returns in the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) A-shares, this paper divides the period between 2005 and 2018 into eight bull and bear market stages to investigate interactive patterns in the Chinese financial market. We employ the LASSO method to construct the stock network and further use the Map Equation method to analyze the evolution of modules in the SSE A-shares market. Empirical results show: (1) The connected effect is more significant in bear markets than bull markets; (2) A system module can be found in the network during the first four stages, and the industry aggregation effect leads to module differentiation in the last four stages; (3) Some stocks have leading effects on others throughout eight periods, and medium- and small-cap stocks with poor financial conditions are more",

    "translated_abstract": "中国股市中的交互效应在引发异常市场波动和风险传染方面具有显著影响。本文基于2005年至2018年上海证券交易所（SSE）A股的每日股票收益，将该时期分为八个牛市和熊市阶段，以研究中国金融市场中的交互模式。我们采用LASSO方法构建股票网络，并进一步使用Map Equation方法分析SSE A股市场中模块的演化。实证结果表明：（1）在熊市中，连接效应比牛市中更显著；（2）在头四个阶段网络中存在一个系统模块，而行业聚集效应导致后四个阶段模块的不同化；（3）一些股票在所有八个时期中对其他股票具有引领效应，而财务状况糟糕的中小盘股更具有这种效应。",
