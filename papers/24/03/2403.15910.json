    "translated_abstract": "在本研究中，我们确定并放宽了差异中的差异（DID）估计中数据“可混合性”的假设。由于数据隐私问题，往往无法组合来自受试者和对照组的观测数据，因此可混合性不可行。例如，存储在安全设施中的行政健康数据往往无法跨不同司法管辖区组合。我们提出了一种创新方法来估计具有不可混合数据的DID：UN--DID。我们的方法包括对附加协变量、多组和错开采纳进行调整。在没有协变量的情况下，UN--DID和传统DID给出了相同的受试者平均处理效应（ATT）估计。有协变量时，我们通过数学和模拟表明UN--DID和传统DID提供了不同但同样信息丰富的ATT估计。一个实证示例进一步强调了我们方法的实用性。",
