Targeting a platform that operates multiple service domains, we introduce a new task, Multi-Domain Recommendation to Attract Users (MDRAU), which recommends items from multiple ``unseen'' domains with which each user has not interacted yet, by using knowledge from the user's ``seen'' domains. In this paper, we point out two challenges of MDRAU task. First, there are numerous possible combinations of mappings from seen to unseen domains because users have usually interacted with a different subset of service domains. Second, a user might have different preferences for each of the target unseen domains, which requires that recommendations reflect the user's preferences on domains as well as items. To tackle these challenges, we propose DRIP framework that models users' preferences at two levels (i.e., domain and item) and learns various seen-unseen domain m",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，网络平台同时运营各种服务领域。 针对同时运营多个服务领域的平台，我们引入新任务，即通过使用用户在“已见”领域的知识，从多个“未见”领域推荐项目，以吸引用户的多领域推荐（MDRAU）。 本文指出了MDRAU任务的两个挑战。 首先，由于用户通常与不同子集的服务领域互动，因此可能有大量可能的从已见到未见领域的映射组合。 其次，用户可能对每个目标未见领域有不同的偏好，这要求推荐既反映用户对领域的偏好，也反映对项目的偏好。 为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了DRIP框架，该框架在两个级别（即领域和项目）对用户偏好进行建模，并学习各种已见-未见领域映射。",
