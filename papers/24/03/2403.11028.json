    "title": "What Makes Systemic Discrimination, \"Systemic?\" Exposing the Amplifiers of Inequity",
    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.11028v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Drawing on work spanning economics, public health, education, sociology, and law, I formalize theoretically what makes systemic discrimination \"systemic.\" Injustices do not occur in isolation, but within a complex system of interdependent factors; and their effects may amplify as a consequence. I develop a taxonomy of these amplification mechanisms, connecting them to well-understood concepts in economics that are precise, testable and policy-oriented. This framework reveals that these amplification mechanisms can either be directly disrupted, or exploited to amplify the effects of equity-focused interventions instead. In other words, it shows how to use the machinery of systemic discrimination against itself. Real-world examples discussed include but are not limited to reparations for slavery and Jim Crow, vouchers or place-based neighborhood interventions, police shootings, affirmative action, and Covid-19.",

    "translated_title": "何为系统性歧视？揭示不平等的放大器",
    "translated_abstract": "基于跨越经济学、公共卫生、教育、社会学和法律领域的工作，我在理论上阐明了何为“系统性歧视”。不公正并非孤立发生，而是在一个相互依存的复杂系统内部发生；其影响可能会因此而放大。我建立了这些放大机制的分类法，并将其与经济学中精确、可测试和面向政策的概念联系起来。该框架揭示了这些放大机制可以直接被破坏，或者被利用来放大以公平为重点的干预效果。换句话说，它展示了如何利用系统性歧视的机制反其道而行之。讨论的现实例子包括但不限于奴隶制和种族隔离的赔偿、优惠券或基于地点的社区干预、警方枪击、平权行动和新冠疫情。",
    "tldr": "论文理论上阐述了系统性歧视的本质，提出了放大不平等的机制分类，并指出这些机制可以被打破，或者被利用来放大公平干预的效果。",
    "en_tdlr": "The paper theoretically explains the nature of systemic discrimination, presents a taxonomy of mechanisms that amplify inequities, and discusses how these mechanisms can be disrupted or exploited to enhance equity-focused interventions."
