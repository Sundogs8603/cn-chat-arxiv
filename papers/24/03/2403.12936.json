    "translated_abstract": "法庭记录和判决是法律知识的丰富资源，详细描述案件的复杂性以及司法决定背后的理由。从这些文件中提取关键信息提供了案件的简明概述，对于法律专家和公众都至关重要。随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现，自动信息提取变得越来越可行和高效。本文对GPT-4（一种大型语言模型）在从英国雇佣法庭（UKET）案例中自动提取信息的应用进行了全面研究。我们通过手动验证过程对GPT-4在提取关键信息方面的性能进行了细致评估，以确保提取的数据准确性和相关性。我们的研究围绕两个主要的信息提取任务展开：第一个任务涉及对对法律专家和公众都具有重要意义的八个关键方面进行通用的提取。",
