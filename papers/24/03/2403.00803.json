In this work, we introduce an innovative meta-learning solution tailored to the personalization of models for individual members and other entities, coupled with the frequent updates based on the latest user interaction signals. Specifically, we leverage the Model-Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) algorithm to adapt per-task sub-networks using recent user interaction data.

    "translated_abstract": "在推荐系统领域，深度神经网络的普遍采用已经成为建模各种业务目标的主导范式。随着用户基数的持续增长，个性化和频繁的模型更新的必要性已经变得至关重要，以确保向各种成员提供相关且更新的体验。在这项工作中，我们介绍了一种创新的元学习解决方案，用于针对个人成员和其他实体的模型个性化，结合了根据最新用户互动信号进行频繁更新的功能。具体来说，我们利用了模型无关的元学习（MAML）算法，使用最近的用户互动数据来调整每个任务的子网络。考虑到在线推荐系统中生产原始MAML模型几乎不可行，我们提出了一种有效的策略来将元学习的子网络推广应用到生产中。",
