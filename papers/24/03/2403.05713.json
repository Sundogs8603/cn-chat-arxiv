In this paper, we go in a different direction by introducing $\\mathtt{tsGT}$, a stochastic time series model built on a general-purpose transformer architecture. We focus on using a well-known and theoretically justified rolling window backtesting and evaluation protocol. We show that $\\mathtt{tsGT}$ outperforms the state-of-the-art models on MAD and RMSE, and surpasses its stochastic peers on QL and CRPS, on four commonly used datasets.

    "translated_abstract": "时间序列方法在几乎所有处理时间结构化数据的科学领域中都具有基础重要性。最近，出现了一大批具有时间序列特定架构偏见的确定性Transformer模型。本文采取了不同的方向，引入了$\\mathtt{tsGT}$，这是一种基于通用Transformer架构构建的随机时间序列模型。我们专注于使用一个众所周知且理论上合理的滚动窗口回测和评估协议。我们展示了$\\mathtt{tsGT}$在四个常用数据集上在MAD和RMSE方面优于最先进模型，并在QL和CRPS方面超过了其随机同行。我们通过详细分析$\\mathtt{tsGT}$在建模数据分布和预测边际分位值方面的能力来补充这些结果。",
