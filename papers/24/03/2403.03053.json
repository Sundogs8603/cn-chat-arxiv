    "translated_abstract": "获得准确及时的信道状态信息（CSI）是大型天线系统面临的根本挑战。移动系统如5G使用一个波束管理框架，将初始接入、波束成形、CSI获取和数据传输相结合。然而，由于它们之间的相互关系、不断变化的阵列大小以及特定于站点的信道和用户分布，这些阶段的码本设计具有挑战性。此外，波束管理通常集中在单扇区运营上，而忽视了总体网络和系统级别的优化。在本文中，我们提出了一种端到端的学习码本设计算法，网络波束学习（NBL），它捕捉和优化码本，以减少干扰，同时通过极大混合阵列最大化可实现的性能。所提出的算法需要有限的共享信息，却设计出优于传统码本的码本。",
