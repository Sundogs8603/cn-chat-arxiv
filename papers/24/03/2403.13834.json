    "translated_abstract": "异质图上的少样本学习(FLHG)越来越受到学术界和产业界的关注，因为现有的异质图研究往往受到标签稀疏性的困扰。 FLHG旨在解决面对有限标注数据时的性能下降问题，并已有许多最近的研究提出了各种方法和应用。 本文对现有的FLHG方法进行了全面评估，涵盖了挑战、研究进展和未来展望。 具体来说，我们首先对FLHG进行了形式化描述，并将其方法分为三种类型：单异质性FLHG、双异质性FLHG和多异质性FLHG。 然后，我们分析了每个类别内的研究进展，重点介绍了最新和代表性的发展。 最后，我们确定并讨论了FLHG未来研究的有前途的方向。 据我们所知，本文是第一篇系统而全面的FLHG综述。",
