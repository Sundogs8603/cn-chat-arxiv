    "translated_abstract": "多频带射频地图重建（MB-RMR）是无线通信中的关键组成部分，用于任务如频谱管理和网络规划。然而，传统基于机器学习的MB-RMR方法在部署中面临重大挑战，这些方法严重依赖于模拟数据或完整结构化地面实况，这些挑战源自模拟数据与实际数据之间的差异，以及现实世界测量数据的稀缺性。为了解决这些挑战，我们的研究提出了RadioGAT，这是一个基于图注意力网络（GAT）的新框架，专门用于MB-RMR，在单个区域内消除了对多区域数据集的需求。RadioGAT创新地将基于模型的空间-频谱相关编码与数据驱动的射频地图泛化相结合，从而最大程度地减少对大量数据源的依赖。该框架通过创新的编码将稀疏的多频带数据转换为图结构开始。",
