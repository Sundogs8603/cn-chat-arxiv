Embracing the common demand of researchers for better performance and new features for NAO, the authors took advantage of the ability to run ROS2 onboard on the NAO to develop a framework independent of the APIs provided by the manufacturer. Such a system provides NAO with not only the basic skills of a humanoid robot such as walking and reproducing movements of interest but also features often used in HRI such as: speech recognition/synthesis, face and object detention, and the use of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models for conversation. The developed code is therefore configured as a ready-to-use but also highly expandable and improvable tool thanks to the possibilities provided by the ROS community.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个新的软件框架，用于与由联合机器人集团生产的常见NAO机器人的HRI实验。作者利用在NAO上可以运行ROS2的能力，开发了一个独立于制造商提供的API的框架，以满足研究人员对NAO更好性能和新功能的共同需求。该系统不仅为NAO提供了人形机器人的基本技能，如行走和复制感兴趣的动作，还具有常用于HRI的功能，如：语音识别/合成、人脸和物体检测，以及使用预训练的生成式变换器（GPT）模型进行对话。开发的代码因此被配置为一个可立即使用，同时也是一个高度可扩展和可改进的工具，这要归功于ROS社区提供的可能性。",
