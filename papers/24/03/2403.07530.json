This review examines various farming practices and their impact on soil organic carbon storage. After a careful review of the literature, most of the research indicated that different farming practices, such as organic farming, cover crops, conservation tillage, and agroforestry, play vital roles in increasing the SOC content of the soil sustainably. Root exudation from cover crops increases microbial activity and helps break down complex organic compounds into organic carbon. Conservation tillage enhances the soil structure and maintains carbon storage without disturbing the soil. Agroforestry systems boost organic carbon input and fasten nutrient cycling because the trees and crops have symbiotic relationships. Intercropping and crop rotations have a role in changing the composition of plant residues and promoting carbon storage",

    "translated_abstract": "土壤有机碳（SOC）的流失对世界各地的农业可持续性构成严重危险。本综述考察了各种耕作实践及其对土壤有机碳储存的影响。在仔细审阅文献后，大部分研究表明，有机耕作、覆盖作物、保护耕作和农林复合等不同耕作实践在可持续增加土壤SOC含量中发挥着重要作用。覆盖作物的根系分泌物增加了微生物活性，并有助于将复杂有机化合物分解为有机碳。保护耕作增强了土壤结构，并在不扰乱土壤的情况下保持碳储存。农林复合系统增加有机碳输入，加快养分循环，因为树木和作物具有共生关系。间作和轮作在改变植物残体组成和促进碳储存方面发挥作用。",
