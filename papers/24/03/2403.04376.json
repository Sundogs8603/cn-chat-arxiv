As a result, many expressions in these languages are shortened, and their meaning is inferred from the context. In this paper, we focus on the omission of the plurality and definiteness markers in Chinese noun phrases (NPs) to investigate the predictability of their intended meaning given the contexts. To this end, we built a corpus of Chinese NPs, each of which is accompanied by its corresponding context, and by labels indicating its singularity/plurality and definiteness/indefiniteness. We carried out corpus assessments and analyses. The results suggest that Chinese speakers indeed drop plurality and definiteness markers very frequently.

    "translated_abstract": "理论语言学家指出，一些语言（如汉语和日语）\"更冷\"的观察基于这样的事实，即这些语言中短语的预期含义更多地依赖于上下文。因此，这些语言中许多表达方式被缩短，其含义是从上下文中推断出来的。本文着重探讨在汉语名词短语中省略数量和确定性标记，以研究在给定语境情况下其预期含义的可预测性。为此，我们构建了一个汉语名词短语语料库，每个短语都附带其对应的语境以及标签，表示其单数/复数和确定性/不确定性。我们进行了语料库评估和分析。结果表明，汉语讲话者确实经常省略数量和确定性标记。基于此语料库，我们训练了一组计算模型...",
