However, developing reliable automated detection techniques is difficult due to the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation methods. This study introduces a unified melanoma classification approach that supports 54 combinations of 11 datasets and 24 state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. It enables a fair comparison of 1,296 experiments and results in a lightweight model deployable to the web-based MeshNet architecture named Mela-D. This approach can run up to 33x faster by reducing parameters 24x to yield an analogous 88.8\\% accuracy comparable with ResNet50 on previously unseen images. This allows efficient and accurate melanoma detection in real-world settings that can run on consumer-level hardware.",

    "translated_abstract": "黑色素瘤是皮肤癌中最具侵略性的形式，早期检测可以显著提高存活率并预防癌症扩散。然而，由于缺乏标准化数据集和评估方法，开发可靠的自动化检测技术是困难的。本研究引入了一种统一的黑色素瘤分类方法，支持11个数据集和24种最先进的深度学习架构的54种组合。它通过1,296个实验的公平比较，并产生一个轻量级模型，可部署到名为Mela-D的基于Web的MeshNet架构。这种方法通过减少参数，使速度提高了33倍，达到了类似于ResNet50的88.8%的准确率，可在以前未见过的图像上运行。这可以在消费级硬件上高效准确地检测黑色素瘤，可在实际环境中运行。",
