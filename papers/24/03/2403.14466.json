    "translated_abstract": "从复杂、高维数据集中提取有意义的特征在科学领域仍然具有挑战性。目前的方法通常在可扩展性方面存在问题，限制了它们对大型数据集的适用性，或者对特征属性关系做出了限制性假设，从而阻碍了捕获复杂交互作用的能力。BoUTS的通用且可扩展的特征选择算法突破了这些限制，既能识别对所有数据集相关的通用特征，又能识别预测特定子集的任务特定特征。在七个不同的化学回归数据集上进行评估，BoUTS实现了最先进的特征稀疏性，同时保持着与专门方法相当的预测准确性。值得注意的是，BoUTS的通用特征使得数据集之间可以进行领域特定的知识转移，并且暗示了看似不相关的化学数据集之间存在深层连接。我们期望这些结果会产生重要的影响。",
