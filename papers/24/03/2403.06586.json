    "translated_abstract": "上下文感知人类活动识别（HAR）是移动计算中一个热门的研究领域，文献中最有效的解决方案基于监督式深度学习模型。然而，这些系统的实际部署受到需要用于训练的标记数据的稀缺性的限制。神经符号人工智能（NeSy）为缓解这一问题提供了一个有趣的研究方向，即将关于人类活动及其可能发生的背景的常识知识注入HAR深度学习分类器中。现有的用于上下文感知HAR的NeSy方法依赖于逻辑模型中编码的知识（例如本体论），其设计、实施和维护以捕捉新活动和上下文需要显著的人力工程努力、技术知识和领域专业知识。最近的研究表明，预训练的大型语言模型（LLMs）有效地编码了关于人类活动的常识知识。",
