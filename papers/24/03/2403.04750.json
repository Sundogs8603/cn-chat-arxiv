    "translated_abstract": "基于粒子的流体模拟已经成为解决Navier-Stokes方程的强大工具，特别是在涉及复杂物理和自由表面的情况下。最近将机器学习方法添加到解决这类问题的工具箱中正在推动这些数值模拟的质量与速度之间的权衡边界。在这项工作中，我们引领了与深度学习框架兼容的拉格朗日流体模拟器的新方向，并提出了JAX-SPH——一个在JAX中实现的平滑粒子流体动力学（SPH）框架。JAX-SPH基于从LagrangeBench项目（Toshev等人，2023年）中生成数据集的代码，并通过多种方式扩展了此代码：(a)集成了进一步的关键SPH算法，(b)将代码重组为Python库，(c)通过求解器验证梯度，以及(d)演示了这些梯度在解决逆问题和Solver-i中的效用。",
