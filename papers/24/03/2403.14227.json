The integration of Large Language Model (LLM) agents into this setting explores their novel role as peers, assessing impacts as team moderators and participants. We invited two groups of participants to engage in a collaborative learning workshop, where they discussed and proposed conceptual solutions to a design problem. The peer conversation transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. We discovered that peer agents, while managing discussions effectively as team moderators, sometimes have their instructions disregarded. As participants, they foster children's creative thinking but may not consistently provide timely feedback. These findings highlight potential design improvements and considerations for peer agents in both roles.",

    "translated_abstract": "在儿童协作学习中，有效的同侪对话显著提高了儿童协作交流的质量。将大型语言模型（LLM）代理整合到此设置中，探讨他们作为同侪的创新角色，评估其作为团队主持人和参与者的影响。我们邀请了两组参与者参加一个协作学习研讨会，在那里他们讨论并提出了解决设计问题的概念解决方案。同侪对话的成绩单经过了主题分析。我们发现，同侪代理在作为团队主持人管理讨论时，有时会被忽视他们的指令。作为参与者，他们促进了儿童的创造性思维，但可能并不始终提供及时的反馈。这些发现强调了同侪代理在两个角色中的潜在设计改进和考虑因素。",
