    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在许多领域取得了巨大成功，最近的研究探讨了探索LLMs用于图判别任务，如节点分类。然而，LLMs在图生成方面的能力在文献中尚未被探索。图生成要求LLM生成具有特定属性的图，这在药物发现等有价值的实际应用中非常重要，但也更具挑战性。在本文中，我们提出了LLM4GraphGen来探索LLMs进行图生成的能力，通过系统性任务设计和大量实验。具体而言，我们提出了几个任务，并进行了全面实验，以解决有关LLMs对不同图结构规则的理解、捕获结构类型分布的能力以及利用域知识进行基于属性的图生成的关键问题。我们的评估表明，LLMs，特别是",
