    "translated_abstract": "动态AMM池，如时间函数做市所发现的那样，会将其持有物重新平衡到新的期望比例（例如，从两种资产之间的50-50移动到其中一种占优势的90-10），通过引入一个套利机会来实现，当其持有物与目标一致时，该套利机会会消失。构造这种套利机会可以简化为通过其交易函数向市场公开的投资组合权重序列的选择问题。从起始权重线性插值到结束权重已被用于降低池向套利者支付的成本以重新平衡。在这里，我们在权重变化很小的极限情况下获得了$\\textit{最优}$插值（缺点是需要调用一个超越函数），然后获得了一个便宜计算的近似最优方法，几乎实现了相同的性能改进。然后我们展示了这种方法在一系列市场中的应用。",
