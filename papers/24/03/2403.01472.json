    "translated_abstract": "Embedding as a Service（EaaS）已成为一种广泛采用的解决方案，为自然语言处理（NLP）中的各种下游任务提供特征提取能力。先前的研究表明，EaaS容易受到模型抽取攻击的威胁；然而，通过向文本嵌入添加背门水印，并随后验证攻击模型的发布后，可以缓解这一问题。通过对最近用于EaaS的水印策略EmbMarker的分析，我们设计了一种新颖的CSE（Cluster、Selection、Elimination）攻击，它能够移除背门水印同时保持嵌入的高效性，表明先前的水印方法是可以被突破的。针对这一新威胁，我们提出了一种新的协议，通过整合多种可能的水印方向使水印的移除变得更具挑战性。我们的防御方法WARDEN显著增加了水印消除的难度。",
