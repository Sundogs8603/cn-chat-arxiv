    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.04035v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We investigate personalizing the explanations that an Intelligent Tutoring System generates to justify the hints it provides to students to foster their learning. The personalization targets students with low levels of two traits, Need for Cognition and Conscientiousness, and aims to enhance these students' engagement with the explanations, based on prior findings that these students do not naturally engage with the explanations but they would benefit from them if they do. To evaluate the effectiveness of the personalization, we conducted a user study where we found that our proposed personalization significantly increases our target users' interaction with the hint explanations, their understanding of the hints and their learning. Hence, this work provides valuable insights into effectively personalizing AI-driven explanations for cognitively demanding tasks such as learning.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们调查了个性化解释智能辅导系统生成的提示，以证明它们提供提示促进学生学习的有效性。个性化针对具有两种特征（认知需求和认真度）较低水平的学生，旨在增强这些学生对解释的参与，基于先前研究发现，这些学生不会自然参与解释，但如果他们这样做将会受益。为了评估个性化的有效性，我们进行了一项用户研究，我们发现我们提出的个性化显著增加了我们目标用户与提示解释的互动、他们对提示的理解以及他们的学习。因此，这项工作为个性化AI驱动解释提供了有价值的见解，适用于如学习等认知要求高的任务。",
