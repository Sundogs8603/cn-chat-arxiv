    "translated_abstract": "因果推断已经显示出潜力，通过捕捉变量之间的因果关系，提高自然语言处理（NLP）模型的预测准确性、公平性、稳健性和可解释性。生成型大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现显著影响了各种NLP领域，特别是通过其先进的推理能力。该调查重点评估和改进LLMs的因果视角，在以下领域展开：理解和改进LLMs的推理能力，解决LLMs中的公平性和安全性问题，为LLMs提供解释，并处理多模态。同时，LLMs强大的推理能力反过来可以通过帮助因果关系发现和因果效应估计来促进因果推断领域的发展。本综述探讨了因果推断框架与LLMs之间的相互作用，强调了它们的集体作用。",
