    "translated_abstract": "本研究解决了由非高斯噪声驱动的随机微分方程参数估计中的挑战，这对于理解价格波动和传染病传播等动态现象至关重要。先前的研究强调了LSTM网络在估计alpha稳定Levy驱动的SDE参数方面的潜力，但面临高时间复杂度和LSTM链接属性的限制。为了缓解这些问题，我们引入了PEnet，这是一种基于CNN-LSTM的三阶段模型，提供了一种端到端方法，具有优越的准确性和适应不同数据结构的能力，通过CNN对初始数据特征进行浓缩，为长序列观测提供增强的推断速度，并具有高泛化能力，允许其应用于各种复杂的SDE场景。对合成数据集的实验验证了PEnet在估计SDE中的显著优势。",
