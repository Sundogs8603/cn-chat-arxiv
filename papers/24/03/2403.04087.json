A significant challenge in research related to mapping typography to cognition is the creation of thousands of typefaces with minor variations, a process that is both labor-intensive and requires the expertise of skilled typographers. Cognitive science research highlights that the design and form of letters, along with the text's overall layout, are crucial in determining the ease of reading and other cognitive properties of type such as perceived beauty and memorability.

    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.04087v1 公告类型: 新 抽象: 认知类型项目致力于开发计算工具，以实现具有不同认知特性的字体设计。该倡议旨在赋予排版者制作可提高在线广告点击率、改善儿童读物阅读水平、让诵读者创建个性化字体，或者提供媒体文本内容客户反馈见解的字体设计能力。与将排版映射到认知相关的研究中的一个重大挑战是创建成千上万种具有微小变化的字体，这个过程既劳动密集又需要经验丰富的排版者的专业知识。认知科学研究强调字母的设计和形式以及文本整体布局对阅读的便利性和其他字体认知属性例如感知美感和记忆性至关重要。这些因素不仅影响字体的易读性和清晰度，也影响字体的美观和记忆性。",
