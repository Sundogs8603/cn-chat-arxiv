    "translated_abstract": "航空安全在现代社会至关重要，致力于减少事故并提高安全标准。在这一努力的核心是对航空事故报告进行分析，这些丰富的文本资源揭示了航空事故背后的原因和影响因素。本文比较了两种著名的主题建模技术，Latent Dirichlet Allocation（LDA）和Non-negative Matrix Factorization（NMF），并将其运用在航空事故报告分析的背景下。研究利用了National Transportation Safety Board（NTSB）数据集，主要目标是自动化和简化识别事故报告中潜在主题和模式的过程。利用一致性值（C_v）度量来评估生成主题的质量。LDA表现出更高的主题连贯性，表明主题内单词之间具有更强的语义相关性。同时，NMF在生产...",
