    "translated_abstract": "混淆罪名预测是法律人工智能中一个具有挑战性的任务，涉及根据事实描述预测混淆罪名。现有的罪名预测方法在表现上已经展现出令人印象深刻的效果，但在处理混淆罪名（如抢夺与抢劫）时面临着重大挑战。在法律领域，构成要素在区分混淆罪名中扮演着至关重要的角色。构成要素是潜在刑罚背后的基本行为，并且在不同罪名之间有微妙的区别。本文介绍了一种新的从图到词袋（FWGB）方法，该方法引入了有关构成要素的领域知识，以指导模型在混淆罪名上做出判断，类似于法官的推理过程。具体而言，我们首先构建了一个包含构成要素的法律知识图，以帮助为每种罪名选择关键词，形成一个单词袋。",
