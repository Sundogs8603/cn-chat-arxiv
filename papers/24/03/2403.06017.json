    "translated_abstract": "公平图学习在许多实际应用中起着关键作用。最近，提出了许多公平图学习方法；然而，它们的评估往往依赖于构造不佳的半合成数据集或低标准的真实世界数据集。在这种情况下，即使是基本的多层感知机（MLP）也可以在效用和公平性方面胜过图神经网络（GNNs）。在这项工作中，我们说明许多数据集未能提供有意义的边缘信息，这可能挑战使用图结构在这些问题中的必要性。为解决这些问题，我们开发并引入了一个充分满足广泛要求的合成、半合成和真实世界数据集集合。这些数据集经过精心设计，包括对于模型公平评价至关重要的相关图结构和偏差信息。所提出的合成和半合成数据集提供了灵活性...",
