Part of the difficulty is associated with the lack of a clear and widely accepted concept of the bioeconomy and moves on to the connections between methods, data and indicators. The present study aims to define the concepts of bioeconomy and to explore the connections between concepts, methods, data and indicators when measuring the bioeconomy economically, and the limitations involved in this process. The bioeconomy concepts were defined based on a literature review and a content analysis of 84 documents selected through snowballing procedures to find articles measuring 'how big is the bioeconomy?'. The content of the 84 documents was uploaded to the QDA Miner software and coded according to the bioeconomy concept, the methods or models used, the data sources accessed, the indicators calculated, and ",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管衡量生物经济对国家经济的贡献具有重要意义，但仍面临着诸多限制，其中一部分困难源于缺乏明确和广泛认可的生物经济概念，这一点延伸至方法、数据和指标之间的关系。本研究旨在定义生物经济概念，并探讨在以经济学方式衡量生物经济时概念、方法、数据和指标之间的联系，以及这一过程中涉及的限制。生物经济概念是基于文献综述和对通过滚雪球程序选定的84份研究文献（用于衡量“生物经济有多大？”）的内容分析来定义的。这84份文档的内容被上传到QDA Miner软件，并根据生物经济概念、使用的方法或模型、访问的数据源、计算的指标进行编码。",
