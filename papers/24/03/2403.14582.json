This is an important and challenging task for automatic question answering. To achieve this goal, we train deep neural networks for multi-class classification of questions into the inferred medical subjects. Using our Multi-Question (MQ) Sequence-BERT method, we outperform the state-of-the-art results on the MedMCQA dataset with an accuracy of 0.68 and 0.60 on their development and test sets, respectively. In this sense, we show the capability of AI and LLMs in particular for multi-classification tasks in the Healthcare domain.",
