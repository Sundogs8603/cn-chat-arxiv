Unfortunately, few-shot NER is severely challenged by the intrinsic precise generalization problem, i.e., it is hard to accurately determine the desired target type due to the ambiguity stemming from information deficiency. In this paper, we propose Superposition Concept Discriminator (SuperCD), which resolves the above challenge via an active learning paradigm. Specifically, a concept extractor is first introduced to identify superposition concepts from illustrative instances, with each concept corresponding to a possible generalization boundary. Then a superposition instance retriever is applied to retrieve corresponding instances of these superposition concepts from large-scale text corpus. Finally, annotators are asked to annotate the retrieved instances and these annotated instances together with original illustrative instances",

    "translated_abstract": "少样本NER旨在仅具有有限数量的实例的情况下识别目标类型的实体。不幸的是，少样本NER受到内在精确泛化问题的严重挑战，即由于信息不足导致的模糊性，难以准确确定所需的目标类型。在本文中，我们提出了超级概念判别器（SuperCD），通过主动学习范式解决上述挑战。具体而言，首先引入概念提取器来从示例实例中识别叠加概念，每个概念对应一个可能的泛化边界。然后，应用叠加实例检索器从大规模文本语料库中检索这些叠加概念的相应实例。最后，要求注释员对检索到的实例进行注释，这些带注释的实例与原始示例实例一起。",
