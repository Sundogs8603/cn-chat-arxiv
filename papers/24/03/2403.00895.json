Both approaches proved useful in modeling intricate relationships within behavioral data, leading to promising outcomes in personalized ranking and next-item recommendation tasks while maintaining good scalability. However, they capture very different signals from data. While the former approach represents users directly through ordered interactions with recent items, the latter one aims to capture indirect dependencies across the interactions graph.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来推荐系统的许多新进展集中在开发基于序列和基于图的方法上。这两种方法在建模行为数据中的复杂关系方面都证明了其有效性，从而在个性化排名和下一个推荐任务中取得了有益的成果，同时保持了良好的可扩展性。然而，它们从数据中捕捉到的信号截然不同。前者直接通过与最近物品的有序交互来表示用户，而后者旨在捕捉交互图中的间接依赖关系。本文提出了一个新颖的多重表示学习框架，利用这两种范式之间的协同作用。我们在几个数据集上的实证评估表明，利用所提出的框架相互训练序列和图组件显著改善了推荐性能。",
