When producing informational videos, editors edit videos by overlaying text/images or trimming footage to enhance the video quality and make it more engaging. However, video editing can be difficult and time-consuming, especially for novice video editors who often struggle with expressing and implementing their editing ideas. To address this challenge, we first explored how multimodality$-$natural language (NL) and sketching, which are natural modalities humans use for expression$-$can be utilized to support video editors in expressing video editing ideas. We gathered 176 multimodal expressions of editing commands from 10 video editors, which revealed the patterns of use of NL and sketching in describing edit intents. Based on the findings, we present ExpressEdit, a system that enables editing videos via NL te",

    "translated_abstract": "信息视频对于向新手和专家解释概念和程序知识至关重要。在制作信息视频时，编辑人员通过叠加文本/图像或修剪镜头来增强视频质量并增加吸引力。然而，视频编辑可能会很困难且耗时，尤其是对于经常在表达和实现编辑想法方面遇到困难的新手视频编辑人员而言。为解决这一挑战，我们首先探讨了如何利用多模态——自然语言（NL）和草图，这是人类用于表达的自然模态——来支持视频编辑人员表达视频编辑想法。我们从10名视频编辑人员那里收集了176种编辑命令的多模态表达，揭示了在描述编辑意图时使用NL和草图的模式。根据研究结果，我们提出了ExpressEdit，这是一个通过NL实现视频编辑的系统。",
