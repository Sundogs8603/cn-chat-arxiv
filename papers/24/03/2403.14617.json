    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.14617v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: We introduce Videoshop, a training-free video editing algorithm for localized semantic edits. Videoshop allows users to use any editing software, including Photoshop and generative inpainting, to modify the first frame; it automatically propagates those changes, with semantic, spatial, and temporally consistent motion, to the remaining frames. Unlike existing methods that enable edits only through imprecise textual instructions, Videoshop allows users to add or remove objects, semantically change objects, insert stock photos into videos, etc. with fine-grained control over locations and appearance. We achieve this through image-based video editing by inverting latents with noise extrapolation, from which we generate videos conditioned on the edited image. Videoshop produces higher quality edits against 6 baselines on 2 editing benchmarks using 10 evaluation metrics.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了Videoshop，这是一个无需训练的用于本地化语义编辑的视频编辑算法。Videoshop允许用户使用任何编辑软件，包括Photoshop和生成填充，修改第一帧；它会自动将这些更改传播到其余帧，保持语义、空间和时间上的一致运动。与现有方法只能通过不精确的文本指令进行编辑不同，Videoshop允许用户添加或删除对象，语义上更改对象，将素材照片插入视频等，并对位置和外观进行细粒度控制。我们通过对潜在值进行噪声外推反演的图像为基础的视频编辑来实现这一目标，从中我们生成根据编辑图像调整的视频。Videoshop在2个编辑基准测试中使用10个评估指标对6个基线取得了更高质量的编辑效果。",
