In this paper, we endeavored to create a new 'compromise' definition that should resonate with most experts previously involved in defining this concept and aimed to validate one of the existing definitions. We reviewed 60 definitions of smart cities from industry, academia, and various relevant organizations, employing transformer architecture-based generative AI and semantic text analysis to reach this compromise.

    "translated_abstract": "全球各地的城市正在迅速采用智能技术，改变城市生活。尽管存在这一趋势，但有关“智慧城市”的普遍接受的定义仍然难以界定。本文旨在创建一个应与先前参与定义这一概念的大多数专家 resonating 的新“妥协”定义，并旨在验证现有定义之一。我们从行业、学术界和各种相关组织中审查了60个智慧城市的定义，采用基于Transformer架构的生成AI和语义文本分析以达成这一妥协。我们提出了一种语义相似度度量作为评估技术，通常可用于比较不同智慧城市定义，评估其独特性或相似性。我们的方法利用生成AI来分析各种现有定义。",
