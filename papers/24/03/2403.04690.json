This restriction, parameterized by a window size and dilation factor, draws a spectrum of possible attention patterns between linear projection and self attention. Neighborhood attention, and more generally sliding window attention patterns, have long been bounded by infrastructure, particularly in higher-rank spaces (2-D and 3-D), calling for the development of custom kernels, which have been limited in either functionality, or performance, if not both. In this work, we first show that neighborhood attention can be represented as a batched GEMM problem, similar to standard attention, and implement it for 1-D and 2-D neighborhood attention. These kernels on average provide 895% and 272% improvement in full precision latency compared to existing naive kernels for 1-D and 2-D neighborhood attention respectively. ",

    "translated_abstract": "邻域注意力通过限制每个标记的注意力范围为其最近的邻居来降低自注意力的成本。该限制由窗口大小和扩张因子参数化，介于线性投影和自注意力之间绘制了可能的注意力模式谱。邻域注意力，以及更一般地滑动窗口注意力模式，在基础设施方面长期受到限制，特别是在更高秩的空间（2-D和3-D），促使开发定制内核的发展，这些内核在功能或性能方面受限，如果不是两者都有。在这项工作中，我们首先展示邻域注意力可以表示为批量化的GEMM问题，类似于标准注意力，并为1-D和2-D邻域注意力实现它。与现有的简单内核相比，这些内核平均提供了分别是1-D和2-D邻域注意力的全精度延迟改进分别为895%和272%。",
