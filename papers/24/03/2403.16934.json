This paper aims to analyze the allocation of competitive research funding from different perspectives: How reliable are decision processes for funding? What are the economic costs of competitive funding? How does competition for funds affect doing risky research? How do competitive funding environments affect scientists themselves, and which ethical issues must be considered? We attempt to identify gaps in our knowledge of research funding systems; we propose recommendations for policymakers and funding agencies, including empirical experiments of decision processes and the collection of data on these processes.

    "translated_abstract": "研究资金系统并不是孤立的系统 - 它们嵌入在一个对整个科学系统有着巨大影响的更大系统中。本文旨在从不同角度分析竞争性研究资金的分配：资金决策过程的可靠性如何？竞争性资金的经济成本是多少？为了进行风险研究，为资金竞争如何影响？竞争资金环境如何影响科学家本身，以及必须考虑哪些伦理问题？我们试图找出对研究资金系统的知识的空白；我们提出了对政策制定者和资助机构的建议，包括对决策过程进行实证实验和收集这些过程的数据。通过我们的建议，希望有助于发展改进的组织研究资金的方式。",
