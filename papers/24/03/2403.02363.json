    "translated_abstract": "真实世界的数据集通常表现出嘈杂标签和类别不平衡，如长尾分布。先前的研究通过区分嘈杂和干净样本来解决这个问题，但依赖于基于嘈杂长尾数据的预测信息会引入潜在错误。为了克服先前研究的局限性，我们提出了一种有效的两阶段方法，将软标签修复与多专家集成学习相结合。在稳健的软标签修复的第一阶段中，我们通过对比学习获得无偏特征，使用经过精心设计的BAlanced Noise-tolerant Cross-entropy (BANC) 损失训练的分类器进行初步预测。在第二阶段，我们的标签修复方法被应用于为多专家集成学习获取软标签，为长尾嘈杂标签问题提供了一个原则性的解决方案。在多个基准测试中进行的实验表明，我们的方法在各个方面均优于现有技术。",
