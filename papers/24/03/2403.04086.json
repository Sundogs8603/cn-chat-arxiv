    "translated_abstract": "在大数据和数字化医疗领域，电子健康记录（EHR）已成为一个丰富的信息来源，有潜力改善患者护理和医学研究。近年来，机器学习模型在分析EHR数据以预测患者未来健康状况方面得到了广泛应用。在其中，一些研究提倡使用多任务学习（MTL）来联合预测多个目标疾病，以提高单任务学习的预测性能。然而，由于当前EHR数据的MTL框架严重依赖于人工专家来识别用于联合训练的任务组和设计模型架构，存在显著局限性。为减少人为干预并改进框架设计，我们提出了一种名为AutoDP的自动化方法，可以同时搜索任务分组和架构的最佳配置。为了解决涵盖任务组合和架构的广泛联合搜索空间，",
