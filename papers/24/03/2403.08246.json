To accommodate the different semantics of negative and positive links, existing works utilize two independent encoders to model users' positive and negative preferences, respectively.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，符号感知图推荐引起了广泛关注，因为它将从用户与项目之间的正负交互（即，图中的链接）中学习用户的负偏好，除了正偏好。为了适应负链接和正链接的不同语义，现有作品利用两个独立的编码器分别建模用户的正负偏好。然而，这些方法无法从由多个带有不同符号的链接形成的高阶异构交互中学习负偏好，导致负用户偏好不准确和不完整。为了应对这些棘手的问题，我们提出了一种新颖的面向推荐的轻量级符号图卷积网络LSGRec，采用统一建模方法同时对高阶用户的正负偏好进行建模。",
