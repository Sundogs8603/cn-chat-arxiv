    "translated_abstract": "RoboChart是RoboStar框架中的核心符号，将现代建模和形式化验证技术引入软件工程领域的机器人技术中。它是一种面向机器人的定时和概率特定领域语言，提供类似UML的架构和状态机建模。本文介绍了RoboCertProb，用于指定在RoboChart中建模的概率机器人系统的定量属性。RoboCertProb的语义基于PCTL*。为了在RoboChart模型上解释RoboCertProb，我们为RoboChart提供了一个马尔可夫语义（DTMC和MDPs），该语义来自于RoboChart到PRISM语言的现有转换语义。除了属性规范，RoboCertProb还允许我们在RoboChart模型中配置松散常量和未指定的函数和操作。它使我们能够设置环境输入以验证在概率模型检查器中不直接支持的反应式概率系统。",
