We propose to globally learn a neural network that will then be applied locally at inference time. Leveraging recent advancements in self-supervised foundational models, we train the network without any labeling by simply masking different samples and learning to predict their covariance given their surrounding neighbors. The architecture is based on the popular attention mechanism. Its main advantage over classical methods is the automatic exploitation of global characteristics without any distributional assumptions or regularization. It can be pre-trained as a foundation model and then be repurposed for various downstream tasks, e.g., adaptive target detection in radar or hyperspectral imagery.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑使用深度学习进行协方差估计。我们提出全局学习一个神经网络，然后在推断时局部应用该网络。利用自监督基础模型的最新进展，我们通过简单地屏蔽不同样本并学习预测它们周围邻居的协方差来训练网络，无需任何标签。该架构基于流行的注意力机制。与传统方法相比，其主要优势在于在没有任何分布假设或正则化的情况下自动利用全局特征。它可以作为基础模型进行预训练，然后再为各种下游任务重用，例如雷达或高光谱图像中的自适应目标检测。",
