    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究常常假设视觉-语言模型（VLM）的表示是基于形状等视觉属性。然而，目前尚不清楚VLM在表示概念时在多大程度上将这些信息作为优先考虑对象。我们提出了一种新颖的方法，称为Extract and Explore（EX2），用于刻画VLM的重要文本特征。EX2使用强化学习将一个大型语言模型与VLM首选项对齐，并生成包含VLM重要特征的描述。然后，我们检查这些描述以确定对VLM表示有贡献的特征。我们发现，虽然提供了没有帮助信息的虚假描述（例如，单击放大概念的照片），但在VLM表示中起着重要作用。更重要的是，在信息丰富的描述中，VLM在表示视觉概念时显著依赖非视觉属性（如栖息地）。此外，我们的分析揭示了不同的VLM优先考虑不同的内容。",
