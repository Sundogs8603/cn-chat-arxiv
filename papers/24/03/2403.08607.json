However, their lack of domain-specific knowledge limits their applicability in healthcare settings, where contextual and comprehensive responses are vital. To address this challenge and enable the generation of patient-centric responses that are contextually relevant and comprehensive, we propose MedInsight:a novel retrieval augmented framework that augments LLM inputs (prompts) with relevant background information from multiple sources. MedInsight extracts pertinent details from the patient's medical record or consultation transcript.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成类人响应方面展现出令人印象深刻的能力。然而，它们缺乏领域特定知识，限制了它们在医疗环境中的适用性，而在医疗保健领域，具有上下文和全面性响应至关重要。为了解决这一挑战，实现生成具有上下文相关性和全面性的以患者为中心的响应，我们提出了MedInsight：一种新颖的检索增强框架，它使用多个来源的相关背景信息增强LLM输入（提示）。MedInsight从患者的病历或会诊记录中提取相关详细信息。然后，根据患者的健康历史和状况，集成来自权威医学教科书和策划的网络资源的信息。通过构建一个将患者记录与相关医学知识相结合的增强上下文，MedInsight生成丰富的、特定于患者的响应",
