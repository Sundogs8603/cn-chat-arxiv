    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.10487v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: It is common for us to feel pressure in a competition environment, which arises from the desire to obtain success comparing with other individuals or opponents. Although we might get anxious under the pressure, it could also be a drive for us to stimulate our potentials to the best in order to keep up with others. Inspired by this, we propose a competitive learning framework which is able to help individual robot to acquire knowledge from the competition, fully stimulating its dynamics potential in the race. Specifically, the competition information among competitors is introduced as the additional auxiliary signal to learn advantaged actions. We further build a Multiagent-Race environment, and extensive experiments are conducted, demonstrating that robots trained in competitive environments outperform ones that are trained with SoTA algorithms in single robot environment.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们在竞争环境中感受到压力是很常见的，这种压力源于与其他个体或对手比较获得成功的愿望。虽然我们可能在压力下感到焦虑，但这也可以激发我们最大限度地发挥潜力，以使自己与他人保持同步。受此启发，我们提出了一个竞争学习框架，能够帮助个体机器人从竞争中获得知识，充分激发其在比赛中的动态潜力。具体来说，竞争者之间的竞争信息被引入为额外的辅助信号，以学习出优势行为。我们进一步构建了一个多智能体竞赛环境，并进行了大量实验，结果表明，在竞争环境中训练的机器人胜过了在单个机器人环境中用SoTA算法训练的机器人。",
