Our heuristic algorithm uses larger, high-accuracy models during low-intensity periods and smaller, lower-accuracy ones during high-intensity periods. We also introduce a metric, carbon-emission efficiency, which quantitatively measures the efficacy of adaptive model selection in terms of carbon footprint. The evaluation showed that the proposed approach could improve the carbon emission efficiency in improving the accuracy of vision recognition services by up to 80%.",
