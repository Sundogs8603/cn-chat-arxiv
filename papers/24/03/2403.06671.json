    "translated_abstract": "Tangles最初是作为一种概念引入的，用于形式化图中的高连接区域。近年来，人们发现Tangles也是结构图论和数据科学之间的联系：当将数据集中的相似性解释为点之间的连接时，寻找数据中的簇基本上等同于在底层图中寻找Tangles。本文进一步探讨了数据集中Tangles的潜力，作为对簇的形式化研究。现实世界的数据通常遵循正态分布。考虑到这一点，我们开发了一套关于从高斯混合中抽取的数据集中Tangles的定量理论。为此，我们为数据赋予了一个模拟点之间相似性的图结构，并使我们能够将Tangle理论应用于数据。我们提供了明确的条件，根据这些条件，与边际高斯分布相关的Tangles几乎必然会渐近存在。",
