These models have the potential to generate scientific content that is indistinguishable from that written by humans. Hence, LLMs carry severe consequences for the scientific community, which relies on the integrity and reliability of publications. This research paper presents a novel ChatGPT-generated scientific text detection method, AI-Catcher. AI-Catcher integrates two deep learning models, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The MLP learns the feature representations of the linguistic and statistical features. The CNN extracts high-level representations of the sequential patterns from the textual content.

    "translated_abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), 如GPT-3和BERT，改变了文本内容的写作和传播方式。这些模型有潜力生成与人类写作无法区分的科学内容。因此，LLMs会给科学界带来严重后果，科学界依赖于出版物的完整性和可靠性。本研究提出了一种新颖的ChatGPT生成的科学文本检测方法，名为AI-Catcher。AI-Catcher集成了两个深度学习模型，多层感知器（MLP）和卷积神经网络（CNN）。MLP学习语言和统计特征的特征表示。CNN从文本内容中提取顺序模式的高级表示。AI-Catcher是一个多模态模型，融合了MLP和CNN导出的隐藏模式。此外，还收集了一个新的ChatGPT生成的科学文本数据集来增强AI生成的文本。",
