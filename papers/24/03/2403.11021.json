    "translated_abstract": "近年来视频数据生产的空前激增需求高效的工具，以从视频中提取有意义的帧供下游任务使用。 长期时间推理是帧检索系统的一个关键要求。 虽然 VideoLLaMA 和 ViCLIP 等最先进的基础模型在短期语义理解方面表现优异，但它们在跨帧的长期推理方面却令人惊讶地失败。 这种失败的一个关键原因是它们将逐帧感知和时间推理交织成单个深度网络。 因此，解耦但共同设计语义理解和时间推理对于高效的场景识别是至关重要的。 我们提出了一种系统，利用视觉-语言模型对单个帧进行语义理解，但有效地通过使用状态机和时间逻辑（TL）公式对事件的长期演变进行推理，这些公式在本质上捕捉了记忆。",
