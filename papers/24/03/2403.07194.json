We collected and preprocessed data from 40 students from different multimodal sources: learning strategies from system logs, emotions from face recording videos, interaction zones from eye tracking, and test performance from final knowledge evaluation. Our objective was to test whether the prediction could be improved by using attribute selection and classification ensembles. We carried out three experiments by applying six classification algorithms to numerical and discretized preprocessed multimodal data. The results show that the best predictions were produced using ensembles and selecting the best attributes approach with numerical data.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在利用智能辅导系统来预测大学生的学习表现，使用了不同来源的数据。我们从40名学生采集和预处理了来自不同多模态来源的数据：系统日志中的学习策略，面部录像中的情绪，眼动追踪中的交互区域，以及最终知识评估的测试表现。我们的目标是通过使用属性选择和分类集成来测试是否可以改进预测。我们通过将六种分类算法应用于数值化和离散化预处理的多模态数据进行了三个实验。结果表明，使用集成和选择最佳属性的方法结合数值数据时可以得到最佳的预测结果。",
