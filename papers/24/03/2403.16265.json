As patent documents employ legal and highly technical language, existing semantic textual similarity methods that use localized contextual information do not perform satisfactorily in inferring patent phrase similarity. To address this, we introduce a graph-augmented approach to amplify the global contextual information of the patent phrases. For each patent phrase, we construct a phrase graph that links to its focal patents and a list of patents that are either cited by or cite these focal patents. The augmented phrase embedding is then derived from combining its localized contextual embedding with its global embedding within the phrase graph. We further propose a self-supervised learning objective that capitalizes on the retrieved topology to refine both the contextualized embedding and the graph parameters in an end",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了专利短语相似性推断任务，该任务衡量两个专利短语之间的语义相似性。由于专利文件采用法律和高度技术性的语言，现有使用局部上下文信息的语义文本相似度方法在推断专利短语相似性方面表现不佳。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一种图增强方法，以放大专利短语的全局上下文信息。对于每个专利短语，我们构建一个短语图，将其连接到其焦点专利以及引用/被引用这些焦点专利的专利列表。然后，增强的短语嵌入是从将其局部上下文嵌入与短语图内部的全局嵌入相结合中得出的。我们进一步提出了一种自监督学习目标，利用检索的拓扑来调整两个方面的嵌入：上下文化嵌入和图参数，从而最终提高推断结果的准确性。",
