In this work, we consider the problem of twisting lids of various bottle-like objects with two hands, and demonstrate that policies trained in simulation using deep reinforcement learning can be effectively transferred to the real world. With novel engineering insights into physical modeling, real-time perception, and reward design, the policy demonstrates generalization capabilities across a diverse set of unseen objects, showcasing dynamic and dexterous behaviors. Our findings serve as compelling evidence that deep reinforcement learning combined with sim-to-real transfer remains a promising approach for addressing manipulation problems of unprecedented complexity.",

    "translated_abstract": "用两只多指手臂操纵物体一直是机器人领域的一项长期挑战，原因在于许多操纵任务的丰富接触性质以及协调高维度双手系统固有的复杂性。在这项工作中，我们考虑了使用两只手扭开各种瓶子盖的问题，并展示出使用深度强化学习在仿真中训练的策略可以有效地转移到现实世界。通过对物理建模、实时感知和奖励设计的新工程见解，该策略展示了一般化能力，能够贯穿各种看不见的物体，展示出动态和灵巧的行为。我们的发现证明了深度强化学习结合仿真到真实世界的转移仍然是解决前所未有复杂问题的操纵问题的一个有前途的方法。",
