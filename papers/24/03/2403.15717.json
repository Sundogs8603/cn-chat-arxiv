    "translated_abstract": "事件相机已经成为自主导航系统的一种有前途的感知模式，因为它们具有高时间分辨率、高动态范围和可以忽略的运动模糊。为了处理这些传感器的异步时间事件流，最近的研究表明，需要一种由人工神经网络（ANNs）、脉冲神经网络（SNNs）以及混合SNN-ANN算法组成的组合，以在一系列感知任务上实现高准确度。然而，我们发现在商品边缘平台上执行此类工作负载（该平台具有诸如CPU、GPU和神经加速器之类的异构处理单元）会导致性能较差。这是由于事件流的不规则性质、算法的多样性特征与硬件平台之间的不匹配。我们提出了Ev-Edge，这是一个包含三个关键优化的框架，以提高性能",
