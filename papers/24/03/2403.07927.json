    "translated_abstract": "云服务所有者需要不断监测其服务，以确保高可用性和可靠性。 监控中的空白可能导致事件检测延迟和显着的负面客户影响。 目前的监控创建过程是临时和反应性的。 开发人员使用其部落知识，主要是基于试错的过程创建监控器。 因此，监控器经常具有不完整的覆盖范围，这会导致生产问题，或者冗余性，从而导致噪音和浪费努力。在这项工作中，我们通过提出一种智能监控框架来解决这一问题，该框架根据其服务属性为云服务推荐监控器。 我们首先从微软的791个生产服务中挖掘了30,000多个监视器的属性，并为监视器导出了一个结构化本体论。 我们专注于两个关键维度: 要监视的内容(资源)和要监视的指标。",
