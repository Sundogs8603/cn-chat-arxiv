With availability of such quality ratings for multiple responses, we propose utilizing these responses to create multiple preference pairs for a given prompt. Our work focuses on systematically using the constructed multiple preference pair in DPO training via curriculum learning methodology.

    "translated_abstract": "直接偏好优化(DPO)是一种有效的技术，利用成对偏好数据(通常是每个用户提示选择和拒绝的响应对)将LLMs与人类偏好对齐。在实践中，对于给定提示可能会存在多个响应，这些响应的质量相对于彼此而言有所不同。有了这些多个响应的质量评级，我们提出利用这些响应为给定提示创建多个偏好对。我们的工作侧重于通过课程学习方法系统地利用构建的多个偏好对来进行DPO训练。特别是，我们根据不同的标准将这些多个偏好数据对从易到难(模拟课程训练)排序。我们详细比较了我们提出的方法与标准单一对DPO设置。我们的方法，我们称之为Curry-DPO，在MTbench、Vicuna、Wiz上始终表现出增强的性能收益。",
