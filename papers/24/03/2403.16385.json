    "translated_abstract": "理解图表和图形等数据可视化需要对视觉元素和数字进行推理。尽管在提取式问题上表现出色，但当前的图表视觉问答（chart VQA）模型在复杂推理问题上表现不佳。本文通过数据增强来解决推理能力不足的问题。我们利用已经表现出强大推理能力的大型语言模型（LLMs）作为自动数据标注器，为图表图像生成问题-答案注释。我们方法的关键创新在于“逐步合成”策略：基于LLM的数据生成器学习将复杂问题分解为逐步子问题（原理），然后使用外部工具（即Python）推导出最终答案。这种逐步生成过程是在使用基于模板的QA生成管道生成的合成数据上训练的。实验结果突出显示",
