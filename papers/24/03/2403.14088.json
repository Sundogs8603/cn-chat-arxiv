    "translated_abstract": "蛋白质的构象景观对于理解复杂生物过程中的功能至关重要。传统基于物理的计算方法，如分子动力学（MD）模拟，存在稀有事件采样和长时间平衡问题，限制了它们在一般蛋白质系统中的应用。最近，深度生成建模技术，特别是扩散模型，已被应用于生成新颖的蛋白质构象。然而，现有的基于分数的扩散方法无法很好地结合重要的物理先验知识来指导生成过程，导致采样蛋白质构象与平衡分布之间存在较大偏差。本文提出了一种用于蛋白质构象生成的力引导SE(3)扩散模型ConfDiff，以克服这些限制。通过将力引导网络与一系列基于数据的分数模型相结合，ConfDiff能够实现对蛋白质构象的准确生成。",
