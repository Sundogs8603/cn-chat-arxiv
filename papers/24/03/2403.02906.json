Endangered species, such as the Eurasian Lynx (Lynx lynx), are monitored by a network of automatic photo traps. Yet, this method produces vast amounts of data, which needs to be prepared, analyzed and interpreted. Therefore, researchers working in this area increasingly need support to process this incoming information. One opportunity is to seek support from volunteer Citizen Scientists who can help label the data, however, it is challenging to retain their interest. Another way is to automate the process with image recognition using convolutional neural networks. During the panel, we will discuss considerations related to nature research and conservation as well as opportunities for the use of Citizen Science and Machine Learning to expedite the process of data preparation, labelling and analysis.",

    "translated_abstract": "在全球的自然保护区和国家公园中，技术越来越多地被用于支持保护工作。濒危物种，如欧亚猞猁，通过一组自动照相陷阱进行监测。然而，这种方法产生大量数据，需要准备、分析和解释。因此，从事这一领域研究的研究人员越来越需要支持来处理这些数据。一种机会是寻求志愿公民科学家的支持，他们可以帮助标记数据，但很难保持他们的兴趣。另一种方法是利用卷积神经网络进行图像识别自动化处理。在讨论中，我们将探讨与自然研究和保护相关的考虑因素，以及利用公民科学和机器学习加快数据准备、标记和分析过程的机会。",
