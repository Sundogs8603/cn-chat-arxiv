    "translated_abstract": "多智能体路径规划 (Multi-Agent Path Finding，MAPF) 在各种应用中至关重要，涉及为多个机器人找到无碰撞路径。终身MAPF会在代理完成其初始目标后立即将目标重新分配给代理，提供对实际仓库规划的更准确逼近。本文提出了一种名为缓存增强终身MAPF (CAL-MAPF)的新机制，旨在提高终身MAPF的性能。我们开发了一种称为缓存的临时物品存储和替换的新类型地图网格，并为其设计了一种锁定机制，以提高规划解决方案的稳定性。该缓存机制经过各种缓存替换策略和一系列输入任务分布的评估。我们通过实验确定了三个显著影响CAL-MAPF性能的主要因素：合适的输入任务分布、高缓存命中率和流畅的交通。",
