    "translated_abstract": "背景：基于Transformer的语言模型在许多自然语言处理（NLP）任务中表现出了强大的性能。掩码语言模型（MLMs）吸引了持续的关注，因为它们可以通过在特定语料库上进行训练或微调来适应不同的语言和子域，同时保持比现代大语言模型（LLMs）更轻。最近，针对法语生物医学领域发布了几个MLMs，并且实验表明它们优于标准法语模型。然而，目前没有提供对同一语料库上所有模型进行比较的系统评估。目标：本文提出了一个评估生物医学法语掩码语言模型在临床命名实体识别任务上的性能。方法和材料：我们评估了生物医学模型CamemBERT-bio和DrBERT，并将它们与标准法语模型CamemBERT、FlauBERT和FrALBERT以及多语言mBERT进行比较。",
