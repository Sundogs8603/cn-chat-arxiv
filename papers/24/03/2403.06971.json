In this game, the first player chooses a representation, and then the second player adversarially chooses a prediction task from a given class, representing the prior knowledge. The first player aims is to minimize, and the second player to maximize, the regret: The minimal prediction loss using the representation, compared to the same loss using the original features. For the canonical setting in which the representation, the response to predict and the predictors are all linear functions, and under the mean squared error loss function, we derive the theoretically optimal representation in pure strategies, which shows the effectiveness of the prior knowledge, and the optimal regret in mixed strategies, which shows the usefulness of randomizing the representation",

    "translated_abstract": "当仅有关于未来预测任务的先验知识可用时，我们提出了一种基于博弈的学习降维特征向量表示的形式。在这个博弈中，第一个玩家选择表示，然后第二个玩家从给定类中对手选出一个预测任务，代表了先验知识。第一个玩家的目标是最小化，第二个玩家则是最大化后悔：使用表示进行预测的最小损失，与使用原始特征相比的损失相同。",
    "tldr": "提出了一种基于博弈的表示学习方法，该方法通过最小化预测损失优化表示学习，在有限制条件下找到了理论最佳表示，并展示了先验知识的有效性以及随机化表示的有用性。"
