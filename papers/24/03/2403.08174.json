In this paper, we develop two task-specific objectives tailored to FEVER. Experimental results confirm that the proposed objective functions outperform the standard cross-entropy.

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了FEVER共享任务中事实验证的损失函数。虽然交叉熵损失是训练判决预测器的标准目标，但它未能捕捉到FEVER判决类别之间的异质性。本文提出了两个针对FEVER的特定任务目标。实验结果证实，所提出的目标函数优于标准的交叉熵。当这些目标与简单的类别加权相结合时，性能进一步提高，有效地克服了训练数据中的不平衡。源代码可在https://github.com/yuta-mukobara/RLF-KGAT 上找到。",
