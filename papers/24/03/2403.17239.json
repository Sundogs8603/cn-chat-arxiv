However, these methods often fall short by either overlooking valuable hidden information or misinterpreting critical data. Consequently, such approaches result in an incomplete identification of manufacturers' capabilities. This underscores the pressing need for data-driven solutions to enhance the accuracy and completeness of manufacturing capability identification. To address the need, this study proposes a Graph Neural Network-based method for manufacturing service capability identification over a knowledge graph. To enhance the identification performance, this work introduces a novel approach that involves aggregating information from the graph nodes' neighborhoods as well as oversampling the graph data, which can be effectively applied across a wide range of practica",

    "translated_abstract": "在当前的环境中，从制造商身上识别制造能力的主要方法往往严重依赖于关键词匹配和语义匹配。然而，这些方法常常在忽视宝贵的隐藏信息或误解关键数据方面效果不佳。因此，这些方法导致对制造商能力的识别不完整。这凸显了迫切需要数据驱动解决方案来提高制造能力识别的准确性和完整性。为了解决这一需求，本研究提出了一种基于图神经网络的制造服务能力识别方法，可在知识图谱上应用。为了提高识别性能，本研究引入了一种新颖的方法，涉及从图节点邻域聚合信息以及对图数据进行过采样，该方法可有效应用于广泛的实践领域。",
