    "title": "K-Act2Emo: Korean Commonsense Knowledge Graph for Indirect Emotional Expression",
    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.14253v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In many literary texts, emotions are indirectly conveyed through descriptions of actions, facial expressions, and appearances, necessitating emotion inference for narrative understanding. In this paper, we introduce K-Act2Emo, a Korean commonsense knowledge graph (CSKG) comprising 1,900 indirect emotional expressions and the emotions inferable from them. We categorize reasoning types into inferences in positive situations, inferences in negative situations, and inferences when expressions do not serve as emotional cues. Unlike existing CSKGs, K-Act2Emo specializes in emotional contexts, and experimental results validate its effectiveness for training emotion inference models. Significantly, the BART-based knowledge model fine-tuned with K-Act2Emo outperforms various existing Korean large language models, achieving performance levels comparable to GPT-4 Turbo.",

    "translated_abstract": "在许多文学作品中，情绪通过对行为、面部表情和外表的描述间接传达，需要对叙事理解进行情感推断。在本文中，我们介绍了K-Act2Emo，一个包含1,900种间接情感表达和可推断出的情绪的韩国常识知识图谱。我们将推理类型分为正面情境的推理、负面情境的推理和表达不是情感线索时的推理。与现有的常识知识图谱不同，K-Act2Emo专注于情感背景，实验结果证实了它对训练情感推断模型的有效性。值得注意的是，使用K-Act2Emo微调的基于BART的知识模型胜过了各种现有的韩国大型语言模型，在性能上达到了与GPT-4 Turbo可比的水平。",
