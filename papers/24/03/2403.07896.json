    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.07896v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: The secondary market for Ethereum non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has resulted in over $1.8bn being paid to creators in the form of a sales tax commonly called creator royalties. This was despite royalty payments being enforced by no more than social contract alone. Predictably, such an incentive structure led to zero-royalty alternatives becoming abundant and payments dwindled. A purely programmatic solution to royalty enforcement is hampered by the prevailing NFT standard, ERC-721, which is ignorant of sale values and royalty enforcement therefore relies on (potentially dishonest) third parties. We thus introduce an incentive-compatible mechanism for which there is a single rationalisable solution, in which royalties are paid in full, while maintaining full ERC-721 compatibility. The mechanism constitutes the core of ERC-7526.",

    "translated_abstract": "以太坊非同质化代币（NFT）的二级市场已经支付给创作者超过18亿美元作为销售税，通常称为创作者版税。尽管版税支付仅受社会契约的约束，但可预见的是，这样的激励结构导致零版税的替代品变得丰富，支付逐渐减少。针对版税强制执行的纯程序化解决方案受到当前NFT标准ERC-721的阻碍，因为ERC-721不了解销售价值，版税的执行因此依赖于（潜在不诚实的）第三方。因此，我们引入了一种激励兼容机制，其存在一个可理性化的解决方案，其中版税将被全额支付，同时保持完全的ERC-721兼容性。这种机制构成了ERC-7526的核心。",
