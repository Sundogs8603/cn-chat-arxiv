    "translated_abstract": "数据增强在训练合成数据时用于弥合Sim-to-Real领域差距中是有用的。这是因为它们扩展了训练数据分布，从而鼓励模型更好地推广到其他领域。许多图像增强技术存在，由不同设置参数化，比如强度和概率。这导致了一个不同可能增强策略的大空间。对于克服特定数据集的Sim-to-Real差距，一些策略比其他策略更有效，但目前尚不清楚原因。本文介绍了两种不同的可解释度度量，可以结合起来预测某种特定增强策略在特定Sim-to-Real设置中的工作效果，重点放在目标检测上。我们通过训练许多具有不同增强策略的模型并展示与真实数据表现之间的强相关性来验证我们的度量。此外，我们引入了GeneticAugment，这是一种基于遗传规划的方法。",
