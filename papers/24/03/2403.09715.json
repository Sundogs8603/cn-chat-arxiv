However,this proposes a host of potential problems such as spyware or producing an unwanted affect in the target system. End users do not read these EULA's because of length of the document and users find it extremely difficult to understand. Text summarization is one of the relevant solution to these kind of problems. This require a solution which can summarize the EULA and classify the EULA as \"Benign\" or \"Malicious\". We propose a solution in which we have summarize the EULA and classify the EULA as \"Benign\" or \"Malicious\". We extract EULA text of different sofware's then we classify the text using eight different supervised classifiers. we use ensemble learning to classify the EULA as benign or malicio",

    "translated_abstract": "每天用户会下载新软件和更新，每个下载的软件都附带一份用户许可协议（EULA），但这经常被忽略。EULA包含的信息是为了避免法律责任，然而，这可能带来一系列潜在问题，比如间谍软件或对目标系统产生非预期影响。用户不读EULA是因为文档太长，难以理解，文本摘要是这种问题的一个解决方案。我们提出了一个解决方案，可以概括EULA并将其分类为“良性”或“恶意”。我们提取了不同软件的EULA文本，然后使用八种监督分类器对文本进行分类。我们使用集成学习将EULA分类为良性或恶意。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种通过文本分析用户许可协议，识别潜在恶意软件的方法，并使用监督分类器对其进行分类，为解决EULA过长且难以理解的问题提供了一种解决方案。",
