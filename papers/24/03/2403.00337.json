The primary aim is to understand the impact of such nonlinearity on diffusion dynamics, signal propagation, and performance of neural network architectures in discrete-time settings. The study primarily emphasizes experimental analysis, using real-world and synthetic datasets to validate the practical effectiveness of different versions of the model. This approach shifts the focus from an initial theoretical exploration to demonstrating the practical utility of the proposed model.",
