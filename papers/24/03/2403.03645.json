    "translated_abstract": "从各种传感器采集并按时间顺序组织的多元时间序列（MTS）数据涉及关键的时空依赖性，如传感器之间的相关性。为了捕捉这些依赖关系，图神经网络（GNNs）已经成为强大的工具，但它们的有效性受到从MTS数据构建图的质量限制。通常，现有方法仅从MTS信号构建图，这可能会由于小训练数据集而引入偏差，并可能无法准确表示底层依赖关系。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了一个名为K-Link的新框架，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）来编码广泛的通用知识，从而提供有效的解决方案以减少偏差。利用LLMs中嵌入的知识，例如物理原理，我们提取了一个Knowledge-Link图，捕获了传感器的广泛语义知识和传感器之间的链接。",
