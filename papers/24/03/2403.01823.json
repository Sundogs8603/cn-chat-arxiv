These methods leverage the structure of natural language to share data between semantically similar tasks (e.g., \"pick coke can\" and \"pick an apple\") in multi-task datasets.

    "translated_abstract": "语言为将复杂概念分解为可消化的部分提供了一种方式。最近在机器人模仿学习中的工作使用以语言为条件的策略，根据视觉观察和语言中指定的高级任务来预测动作。这些方法利用自然语言的结构在多任务数据集中在语义上相似的任务之间共享数据（例如，“拿可乐罐”和“摘苹果”）。然而，随着任务在语义上变得更加多样化（例如，“拿可乐罐”和“倒杯子”），任务之间共享数据变得更加困难，因此学习将高级任务映射到动作需要更多的演示数据。为了架起任务和动作之间的桥梁，我们的idea是教会机器人动作语言，用更精细的短语描述低级运动，例如“向前移动手臂”。将这些语言动作作为任务和动作之间的中间步骤来预测迫使策略学习共享结构。",
