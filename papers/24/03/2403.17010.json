    "translated_abstract": "安全关键的3D场景理解任务需要的不仅仅是准确的预测，还需要来自3D感知模型的自信预测。本研究推出了Calib3D，这是一项开创性的工作，旨在从不确定性估计的角度基准和审查3D场景理解模型的可靠性。我们全面评估了28个最先进的模型在10个不同的3D数据集上，揭示了能够处理3D场景理解中的误差不确定性和认知不确定性的有见地的现象。我们发现，尽管现有模型取得了令人印象深刻的准确度水平，但它们经常无法提供可靠的不确定性估计 -- 这个关键的缺陷严重损害了它们在安全敏感环境中的适用性。通过对关键因素（如网络容量、LiDAR表示、光栅分辨率和3D数据增强技术）进行了广泛分析，我们直接将这些方面与模型校准相关联。",
