    "translated_abstract": "我们从经验的角度研究了合成数据在现实世界场景中的有效性。利用合成数据训练感知模型已经成为社区采纳的关键策略，因为它具有高效性、扩展性、完美的注释和低成本。尽管已经证明有优势，但很少有研究强调如何有效生成合成数据集来解决实际问题，以及合成数据在多大程度上可以减少实际数据收集的工作量。为了回答这些问题，我们系统地研究了合成数据的几个有趣属性 -- 合成数据与真实数据的等效性，合成数据对实际数据的替代性，以及合成数据生成器的灵活性来填补领域差距。利用M3Act合成数据生成器，我们在DanceTrack和MOT17上进行了实验。我们的结果表明，合成数据不仅增强了模型的性能",
