    "translated_abstract": "家族性高胆固醇血症（FH）是一种遗传疾病，其特征是低密度脂蛋白（LDL）胆固醇或其相关基因水平升高。早期和准确分类FH对于及时干预以减轻危及生命的状况风险具有重要意义。然而，传统的诊断方法复杂、昂贵，并且即使对于经验丰富的临床医生来说也是一个具有挑战性的解释任务，导致高的漏诊率。尽管近年来对于使用机器学习（ML）模型进行早期FH检测产生了兴趣激增，但现有解决方案仅考虑使用传统ML模型进行二进制分类任务。尽管其重要性，但由于底层临床数据的分类性质，因此针对FH检测应用深度学习（DL）的研究处于起步阶段。该论文通过引入FH-TabNet来填补这一空白，FH-TabNet是一个多阶段表格DL模型。",
