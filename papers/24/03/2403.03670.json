Clustering, which unsupervisely extracts valid knowledge from data, is extremely useful in practice.

In this work, we propose a simple but effective framework for complex data clustering (CDC) that can efficiently process different types of data with linear complexity. We first utilize graph filtering to fuse geometry structure and attribute information. We then reduce the complexity with high-quality anchors that are adaptively learned via a novel similarity-preserving regularizer. We illustrate the cluster-ability of our proposed method theoretically and experimentally. In particular, we deploy CDC to graph data of size 111M.",

    "translated_abstract": "在当今数据驱动的数字时代，收集到的数据量以及复杂度（如多视图、非欧几里得和多关联性）正在呈指数甚至更快地增长。聚类无监督地从数据中提取有效知识，在实践中非常有用。然而，现有方法独立开发，处理一个特定挑战，牺牲其他挑战。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个简单但有效的复杂数据聚类（CDC）框架，可以以线性复杂度高效处理不同类型的数据。我们首先利用图滤波器融合几何结构和属性信息。然后通过一种新颖的保存相似性的正则化器自适应学习高质量锚点来降低复杂度。我们从理论和实验上说明了我们提出的方法的集群能力。特别是，我们将CDC部署到规模为111M的图数据中。",
