Eye movements are recorded using a commodity wearable eye tracker (Pupil Labs Neon at 200Hz). On this dataset we investigate the accuracy of user identification using a previously known machine learning pipeline where a Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) is used as classifier. Our highest accuracies are 87.3% for FR and 89.4% for TR. This should be compared to 95.3% which is the (corresponding) highest accuracy we are aware of (achieved in a laboratory setting using the \"RAN\" stimulus of the BioEye 2015 competition dataset).
