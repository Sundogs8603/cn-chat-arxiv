    "translated_abstract": "我们最近目击了一系列先进的大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速增长，这些模型能够生成高质量的文本。尽管这些LLMs已经在各个领域彻底改变了文本生成，但它们也带来了信息生态系统中的重大风险，比如可能大规模生成令人信服的宣传、错误信息和谣言。本文提供了对AI生成文本取证系统的综述，这是一个应对LLM滥用挑战的新兴领域。我们通过介绍一个详细的分类法，着重介绍了AI生成文本取证领域现有的努力，着眼于三个主要支柱：检测、归因和特征化。这些支柱使人们能够实际理解AI生成的文本，包括识别AI生成内容（检测）、确定涉及的具体AI模型（归因）以及对文本的基本意图进行分类（特征化）。",
