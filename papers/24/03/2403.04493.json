    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.04493v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The last decade has seen tremendous progress in our ability to generate realistic-looking data, be it images, text, audio, or video. Here, we discuss the closely related problem of quantifying realism, that is, designing functions that can reliably tell realistic data from unrealistic data. This problem turns out to be significantly harder to solve and remains poorly understood, despite its prevalence in machine learning and recent breakthroughs in generative AI. Drawing on insights from algorithmic information theory, we discuss why this problem is challenging, why a good generative model alone is insufficient to solve it, and what a good solution would look like. In particular, we introduce the notion of a universal critic, which unlike adversarial critics does not require adversarial training. While universal critics are not immediately practical, they can serve both as a North Star for guiding practical implementations and as a tool ",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年里，我们在生成看起来真实的数据方面取得了巨大进展，无论是图像、文本、音频还是视频。在这里，我们讨论了与之密切相关的问题，即量化现实主义，即设计能够可靠地区分真实数据和不真实数据的函数。从算法信息理论的观点出发，我们讨论了为什么这个问题很具挑战性，为什么一个好的生成模型单独不能解决它，以及一个好的解决方案应该是什么样的。特别是，我们引入了通用评论者的概念，不像对抗性评论者那样需要对抗性训练。尽管通用评论者并不立即实用，但它们既可以作为引导实际实现的北极星，也可以作为一个工具。",
