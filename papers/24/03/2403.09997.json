One important use of family history information is in precision health, where the goal is to keep the population healthy with preventative measures. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques can assist with identifying information that could assist health professionals in identifying health risks before a condition is developed in their later years, saving lives and reducing healthcare costs.   We survey the literature on the techniques from the NLP field that have been developed to utilise digital health records to identify risks of familial diseases.
