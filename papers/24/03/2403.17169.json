    "translated_abstract": "自动事实检查在数字时代应对不断增长的错误信息方面引起了极大兴趣。现有系统主要专注于维基百科上的合成论点，并且在真实世界论点上也取得了显著进展。在本文中，我们发布了Numtemp，一个多样化、多领域的数据集，专门关注数字论点，包括时间、统计和多样化方面的细粒度元数据，并且具有不泄露的证据收集。这解决了验证真实世界数字论点的挑战，这些论点复杂，往往缺乏精确信息，这是现有作品主要关注合成论点未解决的问题。我们评估并量化了现有解决方案在验证数字论点任务中的局限性。我们还评估了基于论点分解的方法、基于数字理解的模型，我们的最佳基线实现了58.32的宏F1分数。这证明了Numtemp的关键价值。",
