Existing methods have achieved remarkable results by relying on the large-scale pre-trained models, which primarily focus on the correlations between the input news content and the output predictions. However, the news captioning requires adhering to some fundamental rules of news reporting, such as accurately describing the individuals and actions associated with the event. In this paper, we propose the rule-driven news captioning method, which can generate image descriptions following designated rule signal. Specifically, we first design the news-aware semantic rule for the descriptions. This rule incorporates the primary action depicted in the image (e.g., \"performing\") and the roles played by named entities involved in the action (e.g., \"Agent\" and \"Place\").

    "translated_abstract": "News captioning任务旨在通过描述图片及其新闻文章中的命名实体或具体事件来生成句子。现有方法通过依赖大规模预训练模型已取得显著成果，这些模型主要专注于输入新闻内容与输出预测之间的相关性。然而，新闻标题生成需要遵循新闻报道的一些基本规则，如准确描述与事件相关的个体和动作。在本文中，我们提出了基于规则的新闻标题生成方法，可以根据指定的规则信号生成图像描述。具体而言，我们首先为描述设计了新闻感知的语义规则。这一规则包括图片中描绘的主要动作（例如，“执行”）以及参与动作的命名实体扮演的角色（例如，“代理人”和“地点”）。其次，我们将这个语义规则注入到文本生成模型中。",
