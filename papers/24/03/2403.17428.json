Given the fact that psychiatric interviews are goal-oriented and structured dialogues between the professional interviewer and the interviewee, it is one of the most underexplored areas where LLMs can contribute substantial value. Here, we explore the use of LLMs for enhancing psychiatric interviews, by analyzing counseling data from North Korean defectors with traumatic events and mental health issues. Specifically, we investigate whether LLMs can (1) delineate the part of the conversation that suggests psychiatric symptoms and name the symptoms, and (2) summarize stressors and symptoms, based on the interview dialogue transcript. Here, the transcript data was labeled by mental health experts for training and evaluation of LLMs. Our experimental results show that appropriately prompted LLMs can achieve high performance on both the sympto",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）的进展加速了它们在各个领域的应用。鉴于精神科访谈是专业面试者与被面试者之间目标导向和结构化对话，这是LLMs可以提供实质价值的最未被开发的领域之一。在这里，我们通过分析具有创伤经历和精神健康问题的朝鲜叛逃者的咨询数据，探讨了LLMs用于增强精神科访谈的用途。具体而言，我们研究LLMs是否能够（1）划分表示精神症状的对话部分并命名症状，以及（2）根据访谈对话记录总结压力因素和症状。这里，访谈数据由精神健康专家进行标记，用于训练和评估LLMs。我们的实验结果表明，适当提示的LLMs在症状划分和总结上可以实现高性能。",
