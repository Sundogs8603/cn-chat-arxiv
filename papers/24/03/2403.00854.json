The condition's complexity, human scoring and varied presentations make its assessment and management challenging. This study presents a transformer-based framework for automatically assessing dysarthria severity from raw speech data. It can offer an objective, repeatable, accessible, standardised and cost-effective and compared to traditional methods requiring human expert assessors. We develop a transformer framework, called Speaker-Agnostic Latent Regularisation (SALR), incorporating a multi-task learning objective and contrastive learning for speaker-independent multi-class dysarthria severity classification. The multi-task framework is designed to reduce reliance on speaker-specific characteristics and address the intrinsic intra-class variability of d",
