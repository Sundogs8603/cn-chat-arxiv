    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.07510v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Landmarks are facts or actions that appear in all valid solutions of a planning problem. They have been used successfully to calculate heuristics that guide the search for a plan. We investigate an extension to this concept by defining a novel \"relevance score\" that helps identify facts or actions that appear in most but not all plans to achieve any given goal. We describe an approach to compute this relevance score and use it as a heuristic in the search for a plan. We experimentally compare the performance of our approach with that of a state of the art landmark-based heuristic planning approach using benchmark planning problems. While the original landmark-based heuristic leads to better performance on problems with well-defined landmarks, our approach substantially improves performance on problems that lack non-trivial landmarks.",

    "translated_abstract": "地标是计划问题所有有效解决方案中都出现的事实或行动。它们已成功用于计算引导计划搜索的启发式方法。我们通过定义一种新颖的“相关性分数”来扩展这一概念，以帮助识别出现在大多数但不是所有计划中以实现任何给定目标的事实或行动。我们描述了计算这种相关性分数的方法，并将其用作计划搜索中的启发式方法。我们通过使用基准规划问题实验比较了我们的方法与基于地标的最先进启发式规划方法的性能。尽管原始的基于地标的启发式方法在具有明确定义地标的问题上表现更好，但我们的方法在缺乏非平凡地标的问题上显着提高了性能。",
