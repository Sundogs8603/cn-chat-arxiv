    "translated_abstract": "转移学习是一种有效的方法，通过向在大型数据集上预先训练的模型添加和微调新的分类层，为数据稀缺问题高效地训练机器学习模型。虽然以往有许多研究提出在机器学习服务方面使用同态加密来解决转移学习中的数据隐私问题，但大多数研究仅关注加密推断。在本研究中，我们提出了HETAL，一种基于同态加密的高效迁移学习算法，通过使用CKKS同态加密方案对客户数据进行加密，从而保护客户在训练任务中的隐私。HETAL是第一个严格提供加密训练的实用方案，采用基于验证的早停技术，并实现了非加密训练的准确性。我们提出了一种高效的加密矩阵乘法算法，速度比现有方法快1.8到323倍。",
