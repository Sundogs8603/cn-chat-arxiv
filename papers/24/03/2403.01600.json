    "title": "Can Poverty Be Reduced by Acting on Discrimination? An Agent-based Model for Policy Making",
    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.01600v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: In the last decades, there has been a deceleration in the rates of poverty reduction, suggesting that traditional redistributive approaches to poverty mitigation could be losing effectiveness, and alternative insights to advance the number one UN Sustainable Development Goal are required. The criminalization of poor people has been denounced by several NGOs, and an increasing number of voices suggest that discrimination against the poor (a phenomenon known as \\emph{aporophobia}) could be an impediment to mitigating poverty. In this paper, we present the novel Aporophobia Agent-Based Model (AABM) to provide evidence of the correlation between aporophobia and poverty computationally. We present our use case built with real-world demographic data and poverty-mitigation public policies (either enforced or under parliamentary discussion) for the city of Barcelona. We classify policies as discriminatory or non-discriminatory against the poor",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去几十年里，贫困率下降速度减缓，表明传统的贫困缓解方法可能正在失去效力，需要替代性见解来推动联合国可持续发展目标的首要目标。本文介绍了一种新颖的贫困恐惧代理模型（Aporophobia Agent-Based Model，AABM），以提供计算上的证据表明贫困恐惧与贫困之间的相关性。我们展示了一个使用巴塞罗那市的实际人口数据和减贫公共政策（已实施或正在议会讨论中）构建的用例。我们将政策分类为歧视性或非歧视性对贫困人群。",
    "tldr": "通过引入贫困恐惧代理模型（AABM），本研究在计算上提供了对贫困和贫困恐惧之间关系的证据，以验证歧视对贫困缓解的影响。",
