Depression detection aims to determine whether an individual suffers from depression by analyzing their history of posts on social media, which can significantly aid in early detection and intervention. It mainly faces two key challenges: 1) it requires professional medical knowledge, and 2) it necessitates both high accuracy and explainability. To address it, we propose a novel depression detection system called DORIS, combining medical knowledge and the recent advances in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, to tackle the first challenge, we proposed an LLM-based solution to first annotate whether high-risk texts meet medical diagnostic criteria.

    "translated_abstract": "抑郁症造成危害。然而，由于缺乏心理健康意识和对病症耻辱感的恐惧，许多患者并未积极寻求诊断和治疗，导致不利后果。抑郁症检测旨在通过分析社交媒体上个人帖子的历史记录来确定个体是否患有抑郁症，这可显著有助于早期检测和干预。它主要面临两个关键挑战：1）需要专业医学知识，2）需要高准确性和可解释性。为了解决这一问题，我们提出了一个名为DORIS的新型抑郁症检测系统，结合了医学知识和大语言模型的最新进展。具体来说，为了解决第一个挑战，我们提出了一种基于大语言模型的解决方案，首先对高危文本进行标注以确定是否符合医学诊断标准。",
