    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了提高大型多模态模型（LMMs）在处理幻觉效应方面可靠性的方法，其中模型会生成不正确或无关的响应。没有额外的指导调整范式，我们引入了反事实启示，这是一种新颖的方法，通过精心选择的、不对齐的反事实关键词将反事实思想植入到LMMs中。该方法根植于反事实思维概念，这是一种认知过程，人类在其中考虑替代现实和结果。通过将这种类似人类的推理机制应用到LMMs中，我们旨在减少幻觉效应并提高模型的可信度。我们还提出了双模态验证过程（DVP），这是一个严格的框架，用于选择触发LMMs中反事实思维的最佳反事实关键词，同时考虑视觉和语言上下文。我们在各种LMMs上进行了大量实验",
