    "translated_abstract": "为了有效地应对人工智能革命，人工智能素养至关重要。然而，主要存在于主导语言中的内容在像约鲁巴语（有4100万母语使用者）这样的低资源语言中造成了一定的差距。本案例研究探讨了通过在约鲁巴语中创建和分发AI视频来弥合这一差距。该项目开发了26个视频，涵盖基础、中级和高级人工智能概念，利用故事叙述和简易解释。这些视频采用了一种成本效益高的方法制作，并在YouTube、LinkedIn和Twitter上进行分发，估计触及了来自22个国家的全球观众。对YouTube的分析揭示了观看模式的见解，其中25-44岁年龄组贡献了最多的观看量。值得注意的是，超过一半的流量来源于外部来源，突显了跨平台推广的潜力。这项研究展示了在低资源语言中创建人工智能素养内容的可行性和影响。",
