A central question in tropical ecosystems is understanding palm distribution and abundance. However, accurately identifying and localizing palms in geospatial imagery presents significant challenges due to dense vegetation, overlapping canopies, and variable lighting conditions in mixed-forest landscapes. Addressing this, we introduce PalmProbNet, a probabilistic approach utilizing transfer learning to analyze high-resolution UAV-derived orthomosaic imagery, enabling the detection of palm trees within the dense canopy of the Ecuadorian Rainforest. This approach represents a substantial advancement in automated palm detection, effectively pinpointing palm presence and locality in mixed tropical rainforests. Our process begins by generating an orthomosaic image from UAV images, from which we extract and label palm and non-palm image patch",

    "translated_abstract": "棕榈树在热带森林中发挥着重要作用，对于人类和野生动物来说是重要资源。热带生态系统中的一个核心问题是理解棕榈树的分布和丰度。然而，在热带雨林的图像中准确识别和定位棕榈树由于密集植被、重叠树冠以及混合森林景观中的光照条件变化而面临重大挑战。为解决这一问题，我们引入了PalmProbNet，这是一种利用迁移学习的概率方法，能够分析高分辨率的无人机获取的正射影像图像，从而在厄瓜多尔雨林的密集树冠中检测棕榈树。这种方法在自动棕榈树检测方面取得了重大进展，能够有效地确定混合热带雨林中的棕榈树存在和位置。我们的过程始于从无人机图像生成正射影像，并从中提取和标记棕榈树和非棕榈树图像块。",
