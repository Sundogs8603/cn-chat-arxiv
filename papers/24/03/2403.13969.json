In this study, we conduct a qualitative analysis of an in-depth ethnographic case study of data and algorithms in use at a public college in Ontario, Canada. We identify the data, algorithms, and outcomes in use at the college. We assess how the college's processes and relationships support those outcomes and the different stakeholders' perceptions of the college's data-driven systems.

    "translated_abstract": "算法决策在公立高等教育中日益被采用。高等教育机构的数据驱动实践扩展与新公共管理方法在新自由主义政府的推动下同步进行。本研究对加拿大安大略省一个公立学院数据和算法的深度民族志案例进行了定性分析。我们确定了学院使用的数据、算法和结果。我们评估了学院的流程和关系如何支持这些结果，以及不同利益相关者对学院数据驱动系统的看法。此外，我们发现日益依赖算法决策导致学生监视增加，现有不平等加剧，并导致教师-学生关系的自动化。最后，我们确定了由算法决策延续的增加制度权力的循环。",
