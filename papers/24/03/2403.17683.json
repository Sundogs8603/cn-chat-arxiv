The dataset of this competition is ArtELingo, designed to encourage work on diversity across languages and cultures. The dataset has two main challenges, namely modal imbalance problem and language-cultural differences problem. In order to address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach called single-multi modal with Emotion-Cultural specific prompt(ECSP), which focuses on using the single modal message to enhance the performance of multimodal models and a well-designed prompt to reduce cultural differences problem. To clarify, our approach contains two main blocks: (1)XLM-R\\cite{conneau2019unsupervised} based unimodal model and X$^2$-VLM\\cite{zeng2022x} based multimodal model (2) Emotion-Cultural specific prompt.",

    "translated_abstract": "这篇报告提供了我们在WECIA情感预测竞赛（EPC）中探索和提出的方法的详细描述，该方法通过对带有评论的艺术作品预测一个人的情感。该竞赛的数据集是ArtELingo，旨在鼓励跨语言和文化的多样化工作。该数据集主要面临两个挑战，即模态不平衡问题和语言文化差异问题。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种简单而有效的方法，称为单多模态情感文化特定提示（ECSP），其重点是使用单一模态消息来增强多模态模型的性能，并设计良好的提示来减少文化差异问题。澄清一下，我们的方法包含两个主要块：（1）基于XLM-R的单模态模型和基于X$^2$-VLM的多模态模型（2）情感文化特定提示。",
