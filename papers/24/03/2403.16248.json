However, classic topic modelling approaches (e.g., LDA) have certain drawbacks, such as the lack of semantic understanding and the presence of overlapping topics. In this work, we investigate the untapped potential of large language models (LLMs) as an alternative for uncovering the underlying topics within extensive text corpora. To this end, we introduce a framework that prompts LLMs to generate topics from a given set of documents and establish evaluation protocols to assess the clustering efficacy of LLMs. Our findings indicate that LLMs with appropriate prompts can stand out as a viable alternative, capable of generating relevant topic titles and adhering to human guidelines to refine and merge topics. Through in-depth experiments and evaluation, we summarise the advantage",

    "translated_abstract": "主题建模作为一种成熟的无监督技术，在自动检测文档语料库中的重要主题方面得到了广泛应用。然而，经典的主题建模方法（例如LDA）存在某些缺点，例如缺乏语义理解和主题重叠的存在。本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）作为揭示广泛文本语料库中潜在主题的一种替代方法的潜力。为此，我们引入了一个框架，促使LLMs从给定的一组文档中生成主题，并建立了评估协议来评估LLMs的聚类效果。我们的发现表明，LLMs在适当的提示下可以脱颖而出作为一种可行的替代方案，能够生成相关的主题标题并遵循人类指南来精细化和合并主题。通过深入的实验和评估，我们总结了这种优势。",
