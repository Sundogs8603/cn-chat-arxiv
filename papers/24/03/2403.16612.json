Confidence in the predictions should be reliable since a small increase in the temperatures in a year has a big impact on the world. Calibration of the neural networks provides a way to ensure our confidence in the predictions. However, calibrating regression models is an under-researched topic, especially in forecasters. We calibrate a UNet++ based architecture, which was shown to outperform physics-based models in temperature anomalies. We show that with a slight trade-off between prediction error and calibration error, it is possible to get more reliable and sharper forecasts. We believe that calibration should be an important part of safety-critical machine learning applications such as weather forecasters.",

    "translated_abstract": "季节性预测在检测由气候变化引起的极端热和寒冷时是一项关键任务。对预测的信心应当是可靠的，因为一年中温度的微小增加对世界有着巨大影响。对神经网络进行校准提供了一种确保我们对预测的信心的方式。然而，校准回归模型是一个研究不足的话题，特别是在预测者中。我们校准了基于UNet++结构的模型，该模型被证明在温度异常方面优于基于物理的模型。我们展示出，在预测误差和校准误差之间略微权衡的情况下，可以获得更可靠和更清晰的预测。我们认为，校准应当成为诸如天气预报员等安全关键的机器学习应用的重要组成部分。",
