    "translated_abstract": "从成像体积中重建形状是医学图像分析中经常需要的操作。常见的工作流程从分割步骤开始，然后进行仔细的后处理，最后使用临时的网格化算法。由于这个序列可能耗时，神经网络被训练用于通过模板变形重建形状。这些网络提供了最先进的结果，无需手动干预，但迄今为止，它们主要在解剖形状上进行评估，而个体之间的拓扑变化很小。相比之下，其他作品偏向于学习隐式形状模型，对于网格化和可视化有多重好处。我们的工作遵循这个方向，引入了深度中轴体，一种忠实地从成像体积中近似表达拓扑骨架的半隐式表示，最终通过卷积表面实现形状重建。我们的重建技术显示出在形状重建中的潜力。",
