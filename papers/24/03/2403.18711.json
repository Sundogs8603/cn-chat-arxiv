    "translated_abstract": "当使用多对或三元卫星图像时，当前的立体视觉流水线在实现高准确度的三维重建时表现出色。然而，这些流水线对图像之间变化敏感，这些变化可能是由于多日期获取导致的。这种变化主要是由于变化的阴影、反射和瞬变物体（车辆、植被）引起的。为了考虑这些变化，最近已将神经辐射场（NeRF）应用于多日期卫星图像。然而，神经方法非常计算密集，需要数十小时的学习时间，而标准立体视觉流水线只需几分钟。根据即时神经图形基元的思想，我们提议使用高效的采样策略和多分辨率哈希编码来加速学习。我们的模型，卫星神经图形基元（SAT-NGP）将学习时间缩短至15分钟，同时保持三维重建的质量。",
