These contributions are expected to rise with the growing demand for big data analytics, increasing digitization, and the development of large artificial intelligence (AI) models. The need to address the environmental impact of software development has led to increased interest in green (sustainable) coding and claims that the use of AI models can lead to energy efficiency gains. Here, we provide an empirical study on green code and an overview of green coding practices, as well as metrics used to quantify the sustainability awareness of AI models. In this framework, we evaluate the sustainability of auto-generated code.
