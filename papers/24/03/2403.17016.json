    "translated_abstract": "近年来，各种机器学习架构和技术在产生熟练的中程天气预报方面取得了成功。具体而言，基于Transformer的模型（如Pangu-Weather、FuXi）表现出色，通过将天气数据视为矩形栅格上的多通道图像，几乎可以“即插即用”。然而，矩形栅格适用于2D图像，天气数据在本质上是球形的，因此在矩形栅格上在极地区域出现严重失真，导致用于对极地附近数据建模的计算不成比例。基于图的方法（如GraphCast）不受此问题困扰，因为它们将经纬度格网映射到球形网格，但通常更占内存，需要更多的计算资源进行训练和推断。尽管在空间上是均匀的，球形网格并不容易被Transformer模型隐式建模。",
    "tldr": "HEAL-ViT是专为中程天气预报设计的基于球形网格的视觉Transformer模型，克服了在矩形栅格上处理球形天气数据时出现的失真问题，将经纬度格网映射到球形网格，提高了对极地附近数据的建模效率。",
    "en_tdlr": "HEAL-ViT is a vision Transformer model based on a spherical mesh designed specifically for medium-range weather forecasting, overcoming the distortion issue when handling spherical weather data on a rectangular grid by mapping the longitude-latitude grid to a spherical mesh, thereby improving the modeling efficiency of data near the poles."
