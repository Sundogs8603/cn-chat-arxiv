    "translated_abstract": "糖尿病是由胰岛素产生或利用不足导致的，对身体造成了广泛的危害。现有的诊断方法通常是侵入性的，并伴有诸多缺点，比如成本限制。尽管存在像类间k最近邻(CkNN)和通用回归神经网络(GRNN)这样的机器学习模型，但它们在处理不平衡数据时往往表现不佳。利用传感技术和机器学习的进展，我们提出了一种使用带有批量标准化的反向传播神经网络(BPNN)进行无创糖尿病诊断的方法，结合数据重采样和归一化以实现类平衡。我们的方法解决了传统机器学习中存在的诸多挑战，比如与传统方法相关的性能受限。在三个数据集上的实验结果显示，与传统方法相比，我们在整体准确性、敏感性和特异性方面取得了显著的改进。值得注意的是，我们实现了高准确率",
