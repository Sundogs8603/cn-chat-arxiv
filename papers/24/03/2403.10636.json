Well-planned network design can make a city more resilient and robust to such disruptions, but we still know little about worldwide patterns of vulnerability, or worldwide empirical relationships between specific design characteristics and resilience. This study quantifies and measures the vulnerability of the street networks of every urban area in the world then models the relationships between vulnerability and street network design characteristics. To do so, we simulate over 2.4 billion trips across more than 8,000 urban areas in 178 countries, while also simulating network disruption events representing floods, earthquakes, and targeted attacks. We find that disrupting high-centrality nodes severely impacts network function. All else equal, networks with higher connectivity, fewer chok",

    "translated_abstract": "街道网络使人们和货物能够在城市中移动，但它们容易受到洪水、地震和恐怖袭击等灾害的影响。良好规划的网络设计可以使城市更具弹性和韧性以抵抗此类中断，但我们对世界范围内的脆弱性模式或具体设计特征与弹性之间的关系仍知之甚少。本研究量化并衡量了全球每个城市地区的街道网络脆弱性，然后建模了脆弱性与街道网络设计特征之间的关系。为此，我们在178个国家的8000多个城市中模拟了超过24亿次出行，同时模拟了代表洪水、地震和定向袭击的网络中断事件。我们发现，破坏高中心节点严重影响网络功能。其他条件相同的情况下，连通性更高、瓶颈更少的网络更为脆弱。",
