In this paper, we analyse a widely used benchmark dataset for evaluation of TI tasks, particularly focusing on the entity linking task. Our analysis reveals that this dataset is overly simplified, potentially reducing its effectiveness for thorough evaluation and failing to accurately represent tables as they appear in the real-world. To overcome this drawback, we construct and annotate a new more challenging dataset. In addition to introducing the new dataset, we also introduce a novel problem aimed at addressing the entity linking task: named entity recognition within cells. Finally, we propose a prompting framework for evaluating the newly developed large language models (LLMs) on this novel TI task. We conduct experiments on prompting LLMs under various settings, where we use both random",
