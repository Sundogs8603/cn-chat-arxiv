Although this method has been shown to significantly improve student learning outcomes, it remains a complex labor-intensive task for instructors. Large language models (LLMs) can be used to augment human effort by automatically generating Socratic questions for students. However, existing methods that involve prompting these LLMs sometimes produce invalid outputs, e.g., those that directly reveal the solution to the problem or provide irrelevant or premature questions. To alleviate this problem, inspired by reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF), we first propose a data augmentation method to enrich existing Socratic questioning datasets with questions that are invalid in specific ways.

    "translated_abstract": "苏格拉底方法是一种引导学生独立解决问题而不直接揭示问题解决方案的方法。本文提出一种通过数据增强和偏好优化改进苏格拉底提问生成的方法，用于增强巨大语言模型自动生成苏格拉底问题，以减轻教师的繁重工作量。研究表明，现有涉及提示这些巨大语言模型的方法有时会产生无效的输出，例如直接揭示问题解决方案或提供无关或过早的问题。为了解决这一问题，本研究首先提出一种数据增强方法，以丰富现有的苏格拉底提问数据集；其次，提出一种方法来优化开源巨大语言模型，例如LLama 2，以更倾向于地面真值问题。",
