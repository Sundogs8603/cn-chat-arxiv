    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.15449v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Examining the factors that the counter-speech uses is at the core of understanding the optimal methods for confronting hate speech online. Various studies assess the emotional base factor used in counter speech, such as emotion-empathy, offensiveness, and level of hostility. To better understand the counter-speech used in conversational interactions, this study distills persuasion modes into reason, emotion, and credibility and then evaluates their use in two types of conversation interactions: closed (multi-turn) and open (single-turn) conversation interactions concerning racism, sexism, and religion. The evaluation covers the distinct behaviors of human versus generated counter-speech. We also assess the interplay between the replies' stance and each mode of persuasion in the counter-speech. Notably, we observe nuanced differences in the counter-speech persuasion modes for open and closed interactions -- especially on the topic level",

    "translated_abstract": "研究对抗言论使用的因素是理解在线对抗仇恨言论的最佳方法的核心。各种研究评估对抗言论中使用的情感基础因素，如情感共鸣、冒犯程度和敌意程度。为了更好地理解会话交互中使用的对抗言论，本研究将说服方式分解为理由、情感和信誉，然后评估它们在涉及种族主义、性别歧视和宗教问题的两种对话交互类型中的使用。评估涵盖了人类与生成对抗言论的不同行为。我们还评估了回复的立场与每种对抗言论中的说服方式之间的相互作用。值得注意的是，我们观察到了在开放和封闭交互的对抗言论说服方式上的微妙差异 -- 尤其是在话题层面上。",
