In this work, we study trajectory-level data generation for multi-human or human-robot interaction scenarios and propose a learning-based automatic trajectory generation model, which we call Multi-Agent TRajectory generation with dIverse conteXts (MATRIX).

    "translated_abstract": "数据驱动方法在建模复杂人类行为动态和处理许多人机交互应用中具有巨大优势。然而，收集大规模和带标注的真实世界人类数据通常是一项费力的任务，特别是对于高度交互式的场景。另一方面，基于算法的数据生成方法通常受到模型能力的限制，使其无法为各种应用用户提供所需的现实和多样化数据。本文研究了多人或人机交互场景的轨迹级数据生成，并提出了一种学习基础的自动轨迹生成模型，我们称之为具有多样化背景的多智能体轨迹生成（MATRIX）。MATRIX能够在现实多样化的背景中生成交互式人类行为。我们通过建模显式和可解释的目标来实现这一目标，使MATRIX能够生成人类运动。",
