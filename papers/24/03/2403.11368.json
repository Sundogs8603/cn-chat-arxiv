Notably, we construct a natural language dataset of human driver behaviors through naturalistic driving experiments and post-driving interviews, offering high-quality human demonstrations for LLM alignment.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，LLM技术驱动的驾驶代理在自动驾驶领域展现出了相当大的潜力，展示出类似人类的推理和决策能力。然而，关于使驾驶代理行为与人类驾驶风格对齐的当前研究仍然有限，部分原因是由于缺乏来自人类驾驶行为的高质量自然语言数据。为了填补这一研究空白，我们提出了一个多对齐框架，旨在通过演示和反馈将驾驶代理与人类驾驶风格对齐。值得注意的是，我们通过自然驾驶实验和驾驶后访谈构建了一个人类驾驶行为的自然语言数据集，为LLM的对齐提供了高质量的人类演示。该框架的有效性通过在CARLA城市交通模拟器中的仿真实验得以验证，并得到了人类评估的进一步证实。我们的研究提供了有价值的见解，可以指导设计",
