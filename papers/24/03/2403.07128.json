    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了FAX，这是一个基于JAX设计的库，旨在支持数据中心和跨设备应用中的大规模分布式和联邦计算。FAX利用JAX的分片机制，实现了原生针对TPU和最先进的JAX运行时（包括Pathways）的定位。FAX将联邦计算的基本构件嵌入JAX中，带来了三个关键好处。首先，FAX的计算可以转换为XLA HLO。其次，FAX提供了联邦自动微分的完整实现，极大地简化了联邦计算的表达。最后，FAX的计算可以解释成现有的生产跨设备联邦计算系统。我们展示了FAX为数据中心中的联邦计算提供了易编程、高性能和可扩展的框架。FAX可在https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/fax 获取。",
