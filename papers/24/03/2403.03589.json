    "translated_abstract": "这项研究设计了一个自适应实验，用于高效地估计平均处理效应（ATEs）。我们考虑了一个自适应实验，其中实验者按顺序从由实验者决定的协变量密度中抽样一个实验单元，并分配一种处理。在分配处理后，实验者立即观察相应的结果。在实验结束时，实验者利用收集的样本估算出一个ATE。实验者的目标是通过较小的渐近方差估计ATE。现有研究已经设计了一些能够自适应优化倾向得分（处理分配概率）的实验。作为这种方法的一个概括，我们提出了一个框架，该框架下实验者优化协变量密度以及倾向得分，并发现优化协变量密度和倾向得分比仅优化倾向得分可以减少渐近方差更多的情况。",
