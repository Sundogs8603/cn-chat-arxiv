    "translated_abstract": "传统的文本到SQL解析器在合成涉及多个表或列的复杂SQL查询时表现不佳，这是因为识别正确的schema项和在问题与schema项之间进行准确对齐的挑战固有。为解决上述问题，我们提出了一个针对复杂SQL查询的schema-aware多任务学习框架（称为MTSQL）。具体来说，我们设计了一个schema链接鉴别器模块来区分有效的问题-schema链接，通过独特的链接关系明确指导编码器以增强对齐质量。在解码器方面，我们定义了6种类型的关系来描述表和列之间的连接（例如，WHERE_TC），并引入了以操作符为中心的三元提取器来识别那些与预定义关系相关的schema项。此外，我们通过预测的三元组建立了一组语法约束规则集，以过滤。",
