Keyword in Context (KIC) generation is a task that plays a vital role in and generation applications, such as search engines, personal assistants, and content summarization. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generating unambiguous and brief sentence-contexts for given keywords using the T5 transformer model, leveraging data obtained from the Context-Reverso API.
