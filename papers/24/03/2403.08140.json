BAGEL converts a seed set of randomly explored trajectories or synthetic instructions, into demonstrations, via round-trips between two noisy LM components: an LM labeler which converts a trajectory into a synthetic instruction, and a zero-shot LM agent which maps the synthetic instruction into a refined trajectory.

    "translated_abstract": "在数字环境（例如Web浏览器和REST API）中通过执行动作来遵循自然语言指令对于语言模型代理是一项具有挑战性的任务。不幸的是，语言模型代理经常在没有人类演示的情况下无法推广到新环境。本文提出了BAGEL，一种无需人类监督即可引导语言模型代理的方法。BAGEL将一组随机探索的轨迹或合成指令转换成演示，通过两个噪声语言模型组件之间的往返来完成：一个将轨迹转换为合成指令的语言模型标记器，以及一个将合成指令映射为经过改进的轨迹的零样本语言模型代理。通过迭代执行这些往返操作，BAGEL可以快速将最初的轨迹分布转变为那些被自然语言描述完善的轨迹。我们使用BAGEL演示来在测试时间通过在上下文学习上调零样本语言模型代理。",
