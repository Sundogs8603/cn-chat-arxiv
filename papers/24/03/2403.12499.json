    "translated_abstract": "最近，提出了一种新颖的生成式检索（GR）范式，其中学习一个单一的序列到序列模型，直接生成一个给定查询的相关文档标识符（docids）列表。现有的GR模型通常采用最大似然估计（MLE）进行优化：这涉及最大化给定输入查询的单个相关docid的可能性，假设列表中的每个docid的可能性与其他docid独立。在本文中，我们称这些模型为点对点方法。虽然点对点方法在GR的背景下已被证明是有效的，但由于它忽略了排序涉及对列表进行预测的基本原则，因此被认为是次优的。在本文中，我们通过介绍一种替代的列表方式来解决这一限制，这种方式使GR模型能够在docid列表级别上优化相关性。",
