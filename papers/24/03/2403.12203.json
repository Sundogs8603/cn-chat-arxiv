    "translated_abstract": "我们在基于视觉的自主无人机竞速的背景下，将强化学习（RL）的有效性和模仿学习（IL）的效率结合在一起。我们专注于直接处理视觉输入，而无需明确的状态估计。虽然强化学习通过试错提供了一个学习复杂控制器的通用框架，但面临着样本效率和计算需求的挑战，因为视觉输入的维度较高。相反，IL在从视觉演示中学习方面表现出效率，但受到演示质量的限制，并面临诸如协变量漂移的问题。为了克服这些限制，我们提出了一个结合RL和IL优势的新型训练框架。我们的框架包括三个阶段：使用特权状态信息的师傅策略的初始训练，使用IL将此策略蒸馏为学生策略，以及性能受限的自适应RL微调",
