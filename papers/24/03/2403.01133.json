    "translated_abstract": "传统的人机协作标注时间序列数据（如惯性数据）通常需要访问来自环境的视频或音频等其他模态。这些备用来源为人类标注者提供必要的信息，因为原始数字数据对于专家来说通常过于难以理解。然而，这种传统方法存在许多关于总体成本、效率、额外模态的存储、时间、可扩展性和隐私的问题。有趣的是，最近的大型语言模型（LLMs）也是通过大量公开可用的字母数字数据进行训练的，这使它们能够理解并在自然语言处理以外的任务上表现良好。自然地，这为探索LLMs作为虚拟标注器开辟了潜在途径，其中LLMs将直接提供原始传感器数据进行标注，而不依赖于任何备用模态。这可能有助于解决成本、效率、存储、时间、可扩展性和隐私等问题。",
