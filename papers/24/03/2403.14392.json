FSCIL requires both stability and adaptability, i.e., preserving proficiency in previously learned tasks while learning new ones. Our proposed bag of tricks brings together eight key and highly influential techniques that improve stability, adaptability, and overall performance under a unified framework for FSCIL. We organize these tricks into three categories: stability tricks, adaptability tricks, and training tricks. Stability tricks aim to mitigate the forgetting of previously learned classes by enhancing the separation between the embeddings of learned classes and minimizing interference when learning new ones. On the other hand, adaptability tricks focus on the effective learning of new classes. Finally, training tricks improv",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个一揽子技巧框架，用于少样本类增量学习（FSCIL），这是一种具有挑战性的连续学习形式，涉及对新任务进行连续适应，并且样本有限。 FSCIL 需要保持稳定性和适应性，即在学习新任务时保持先前学习任务的熟练程度。我们提出的一揽子技巧将八种关键且具有高影响力的技术汇集在一起，针对 FSCIL 在一个统一框架下改进稳定性、适应性和整体性能。我们将这些技巧组织成三类：稳定性技巧、适应性技巧和训练技巧。稳定性技巧旨在通过增强已学习类别的嵌入之间的分离和在学习新类别时最小化干扰来减轻先前学习类别的遗忘。另一方面，适应性技巧侧重于有效学习新类别。",
