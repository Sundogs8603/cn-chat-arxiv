L-MAC utilizes a decoder on top of a pretrained classifier to generate binary masks that highlight relevant portions of the input audio.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管深度学习模型在各种任务上表现出色，其复杂性给解释提出了挑战。这一挑战在音频信号中尤为明显，传达解释变得困难。为解决这一问题，我们引入了用于音频分类器的可听图（Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers，L-MAC），这是一种生成忠实且可听解释的后处理解释方法。L-MAC利用预训练分类器之上的解码器生成二值掩码，突出显示输入音频的相关部分。我们用一种特殊损失来训练解码器，该损失最大化分类器对输入音频的掩码部分的置信度，同时最小化模型对掩码部分输出的概率。对领域内和领域外数据的定量评估表明，L-MAC始终产生比几种梯度和掩码方法更忠实的解释。",
