    "translated_abstract": "尽管最近文本到图像扩散模型取得了一些进展，促进了各种图像编辑技术，但是复杂的文本提示通常会由于处理文本信息的瓶颈而导致对一些请求的忽视。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了Ground-A-Score，这是一种简单而强大的与模型无关的图像编辑方法，通过在评分蒸馏过程中加入基准来确保对复杂提示需求的准确反映在编辑结果中，还考虑了图像内对象位置的先验知识。此外，借助新的惩罚系数和对比损失的选择性应用有助于精确定位编辑区域，同时保持源图像中对象的完整性。定性评估和定量分析都证实了Ground-A-Score成功遵循了扩展和多方面提示的复杂细节，确保了高",
