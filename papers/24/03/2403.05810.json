    "translated_abstract": "行人轨迹预测在计算机视觉和机器人领域中是一个关键组成部分，但由于领域转移问题而仍然具有挑战性。以往的研究试图通过利用来自目标领域的部分轨迹数据来调整模型来解决这个问题。然而，在现实世界的场景中，这些领域自适应方法是不切实际的，因为不太可能从所有潜在的目标领域收集轨迹数据。本文研究了一项名为广义行人轨迹预测的任务，旨在将模型推广到看不见的领域，而无需访问它们的轨迹。为了解决这个任务，我们引入了一个循环对齐网络（RAN）来通过领域对齐来最小化领域差异。具体地，我们设计了一个循环对齐模块，通过循环对齐策略有效地在时间-状态和时间-序列级别对齐轨迹特征空间。",
