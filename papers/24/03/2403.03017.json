    "translated_abstract": "嵌入式指导遵循(Embodied Instruction Following，EIF)是嵌入式学习中一个关键任务，要求智能体通过以自我为中心的观察与环境互动，以完成自然语言指令。最近的进展看到在以框架为中心的方法中广泛采用大型语言模型(LLMs)来增强在嵌入式学习任务中，包括EIF任务中的表现。尽管有这些努力，但目前缺乏有关各种组件(从视觉感知到动作执行)对任务性能影响的统一理解。为解决这一差距，我们介绍了OPEx，一个详尽的框架，详细说明了解决嵌入式学习任务所必需的核心组件:观察者(Observer)、规划者(Planner)和执行者(Executor)。通过广泛的评估，我们对每个组件如何影响EIF任务性能进行了深入分析。此外，在这一领域内，我们通过部署多智能体对话策略进行了创新。",
