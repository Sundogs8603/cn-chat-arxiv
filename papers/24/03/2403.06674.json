One intriguing application is car damage detection for insurance carriers which tends to detect all car damages by comparing both pre-trip and post-trip images, even requiring two components: (i) car damage detection; (ii) image alignment. Firstly, we implemented a Mask R-CNN model to detect car damages on custom images. Whereas for the image alignment section, we especially propose a novel self-supervised Patch-to-Patch SimCLR inspired alignment approach to find perspective transformations between custom pre/post car rental images except for traditional computer vision methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "大多数计算机视觉应用旨在识别场景中的像素，并将它们用于各种目的。其中一个有趣的应用是保险公司的汽车损伤检测，它倾向于通过比较行程前后的图片来检测所有汽车损伤，甚至需要两个组件：(i) 汽车损伤检测；(ii) 图像对齐。首先，我们实现了一个Mask R-CNN模型来检测自定义图片上的汽车损伤。而对于图像对齐部分，我们特别提出了一种新颖的受自监督启发的补丁对补丁SimCLR对齐方法，以找到自定义行程前/行程后汽车租赁图片之间的透视变换，除了传统的计算机视觉方法。",
