The VAP model continuously predicts the upcoming voice activities of participants in dyadic dialogue, leveraging a cross-attention Transformer to capture the dynamic interplay between participants. The results show that a monolingual VAP model trained on one language does not make good predictions when applied to other languages. However, a multilingual model, trained on all three languages, demonstrates predictive performance on par with monolingual models across all languages. Further analyses show that the multilingual model has learned to discern the language of the input signal. We also analyze the sensitivity to pitch, a prosodic cue that is thought to be important for turn-taking. Finally, we compare two different audio encoders, contrast",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在多语言数据上应用语音活动投影（VAP），这是一种用于口头对话的预测性交替模型，涵盖英语、汉语和日语。VAP模型持续预测双人对话中参与者即将发生的语音活动，利用交叉注意力Transformer捕捉参与者之间的动态互动。结果表明，在单一语言上训练的VAP模型在其他语言上的应用不会产生很好的预测。然而，在三种语言上训练的多语言模型，在所有语言上表现出与单语模型相当的预测性能。进一步的分析表明，多语言模型已学会辨别输入信号的语言。我们还分析了对音调敏感性，这是一种被认为对于交替非常重要的韵律线索。最后，我们比较了两种不同的音频编码器。",
