    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.05996v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: We show that deep reinforcement learning can maintain its ability to learn without resetting network parameters in settings where the number of gradient updates greatly exceeds the number of environment samples. Under such large update-to-data ratios, a recent study by Nikishin et al. (2022) suggested the emergence of a primacy bias, in which agents overfit early interactions and downplay later experience, impairing their ability to learn. In this work, we dissect the phenomena underlying the primacy bias. We inspect the early stages of training that ought to cause the failure to learn and find that a fundamental challenge is a long-standing acquaintance: value overestimation. Overinflated Q-values are found not only on out-of-distribution but also in-distribution data and can be traced to unseen action prediction propelled by optimizer momentum. We employ a simple unit-ball normalization that enables learning under large update ratios",

    "translated_abstract": "我们展示了深度强化学习在设置中可以在梯度更新次数大大超过环境样本数量的情况下保持学习能力，而无需重置网络参数。在这种大量更新与数据比例的情况下，尼基辛等人 (2022) 的最近一项研究指出了一个首要偏差的出现，即代理在早期交互中过拟合并淡化后续经验，从而损害了其学习能力。在这项工作中，我们深入解析了导致首要偏差的现象。我们检查了应该导致学习失败的训练早期阶段，并发现一个根本性挑战是长期以来存在的问题：价值高估。我们发现Q值不仅在分布外数据上被高估，而且在分布内数据上也是如此，可以追溯到由优化器动量推动的未见的动作预测。我们采用了一种简单的单位球归一化方法，可以在大更新比例下实现学习。",
