LLMs possess the capability to interpret knowledge, answer questions, and consider context, thus providing support for dialogic teaching to students. Therefore, an examination of the capacity of LLMs to effectively fulfill instructional roles, thereby facilitating student learning akin to human educators within dialogic teaching scenarios, is an exceptionally valuable research topic.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，人工智能技术的快速发展，尤其是大型语言模型（LLMs）如ChatGPT的出现，为教育领域的应用带来了显著的前景。 LLM具有解释知识、回答问题和考虑上下文的能力，因此为学生提供对话式教学支持。因此，检验LLM有效履行教学角色的能力，从而在对话教学场景中促进学生学习的能力，类似于人类教育者，是一个非常有价值的研究课题。 本研究招募了34名本科生作为参与者，随机分为两组。 实验组使用ChatGPT进行对话式教学，而控制组与人类教师互动。 两组都学习了信息相关课程“数字图像”的直方图均衡单元。",
