However, the inadvertent selection of false negatives remains a major concern in hard negative sampling, as these false negatives can provide incorrect information and mislead the model learning. To date, only a small number of studies have been committed to solve the false negative problem, primarily focusing on designing sophisticated sampling algorithms to filter false negatives. In contrast, this paper shifts its focus to refining the loss function. We find that the original Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), initially designed for uniform negative sampling, is inadequate in adapting to hard sampling scenarios. Hence, we introduce an enhanced Bayesian Personalized Ranking objective, named as Hard-BPR, which is specifically crafted for dynamic hard negative sampling to mitigate the influence",

    "translated_abstract": "在隐式协同过滤中，发展了困难的负例挖掘技术来加速和增强推荐模型的学习。然而，在困难负例抽样中，意外选择假负例仍然是一个主要问题，因为这些假负例可能提供不正确的信息并误导模型学习。迄今为止，只有少数研究致力于解决假负例问题，主要集中在设计复杂的抽样算法来过滤假负例。相比之下，本文将焦点转向了细化损失函数。我们发现最初设计用于均匀负例抽样的原始贝叶斯个性化排序（BPR）在适应困难抽样场景时是不足的。因此，我们引入了一个增强的贝叶斯个性化排序目标，命名为Hard-BPR，专门为动态困难负例抽样而设计，以减轻影响。",
