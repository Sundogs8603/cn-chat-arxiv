However, producing high-quality standard planes is difficult, influenced by the sonographer's expertise and factors like the maternal BMI or the fetus dynamics. In this work, we propose using diffusion-based counterfactual explainable AI to generate realistic high-quality standard planes from low-quality non-standard ones. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing plausible counterfactuals of increased quality. This shows future promise both for enhancing training of clinicians by providing visual feedback, as well as for improving image quality and, consequently, downstream diagnosis and monitoring.",

    "translated_abstract": "怀孕期超声图像质量对准确诊断和监测胎儿健康至关重要。然而，生成高质量的标准平面很困难，受到超声波技术人员的专业知识以及像孕妇BMI或胎儿动态等因素的影响。在这项工作中，我们提出使用基于扩散的反事实可解释人工智能，从低质量的非标准平面生成逼真的高质量标准平面。通过定量和定性评估，我们证明了我们的方法在生成质量增加的可信反事实方面的有效性。这为通过提供视觉反馈加强临床医生培训以及改进图像质量，从而改善下游诊断和监测提供了未来的希望。",
