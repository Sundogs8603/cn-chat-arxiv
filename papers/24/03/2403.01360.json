This paper selects a sample of Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2021, empirically analyses the specific impact of the gap between words and deeds in digital transformation (GDT) on the stock price crash risk, and explores the possible causes of GDT. We found that GDT significantly increases the stock price crash risk, and this finding is still valid after a series of robustness tests. In a further study, a deeper examination of the causes of GDT reveals that firms' perceptions of economic policy uncertainty significantly increase GDT, and the effect is more pronounced in the sample of loss-making firms. At the same time, the results of the heterogeneity test suggest that investors are more tolerant of state-owned enterprises when they are in the GDT situati",

    "translated_abstract": "本文选取2010年至2021年间上市的上海和深圳A股上市公司作为样本，从实证角度分析了数字化转型中言行之间的鸿沟（GDT）对股价崩盘风险的具体影响，并探讨了GDT可能的原因。研究发现，GDT显著增加了股价崩盘风险，而且这一发现在一系列稳健性测试后仍然有效。进一步的研究深入探讨了GDT的原因，发现企业对经济政策不确定性的看法显著增加了GDT，并且在亏损公司样本中影响更为显著。同时，异质性检验的结果表明，在GDT情况下，投资者对国有企业更具包容性。",
