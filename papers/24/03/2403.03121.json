While societal biases and stereotypes have been extensively researched in various NLP applications, there is a surprising gap for emotion analysis. However, emotion and gender are closely linked in societal discourse. E.g., women are often thought of as more empathetic, while men's anger is more socially accepted. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive study of gendered emotion attribution in five state-of-the-art LLMs (open- and closed-source). We investigate whether emotions are gendered, and whether these variations are based on societal stereotypes. We prompt the models to adopt a gendered persona and attribute emotions to an event like 'When I had a serious argument with a dear person'. We then analyze the emotions generated by the models in relation to the gender-event pairs. We find that all models consistently exhibit gendered e",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）反映社会规范和偏见，尤其是关于性别的。虽然社会偏见和刻板印象在各种自然语言处理应用中得到了广泛研究，但在情绪分析方面存在一个令人惊讶的空白。然而，在社会话语中，情绪和性别密切相关。例如，女性经常被认为更具移情能力，而男性的愤怒更受社会接受。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了对五种最先进的LLMs（开源和封闭源）进行性别化情绪归因的首次全面研究。我们调查情绪是否具有性别特征，以及这些变化是否基于社会刻板印象。我们提示模型采用性别化角色并将情绪归因于类似“当我与亲近的人发生严重争执”这样的事件。然后我们分析模型生成的情绪与性别-事件对之间的关系。我们发现所有模型一致展现出性别化。",
