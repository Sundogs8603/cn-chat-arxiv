Our work provides an initial attempt to theoretically analyze the learning dynamics of human preference alignment.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类意图对齐已成为安全部署模型在实际系统中的关键任务。现有的对齐方法虽然在经验上取得了成功，但理论上了解这些方法如何影响模型行为仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。我们的工作首次尝试在理论上分析人类偏好对齐的学习动态。我们正式展示了偏好数据集的分布如何影响模型更新速度，并对训练准确度提供了严格的保证。我们的理论还揭示了一个复杂现象，即优化易于优先考虑具有更高偏好可区分性的行为。我们在当代LLMs和对齐任务上在实证上验证了我们的发现，强化了我们的理论见解，并为未来的对齐方法提供了启示。免责声明：本文包含有效",
