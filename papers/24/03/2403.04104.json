We provide the first causal investigation into the boom period of the 1999-2010 U.S. cross-metropolitan business cycle. Using a novel research design, we show that credit expansion in private-label mortgages causes a differentially stronger boom (2000-2006) and bust (2007-2010) cycle in the house-related industries in the high net-export-growth areas. Most importantly, our unique research design enables us to perform the most comprehensive tests on theories (hypotheses) regarding the business cycle. We show that the following theories (hypotheses) cannot explain the cause of the 1999-2010 U.S. business cycle: the speculative euphoria hypothesis, the real business cycle theory, the collateral-driven credit cycle theory, the business uncertainty theory, and the extrapolative exp",

    "translated_abstract": "使用跨国数据进行的实证商业周期研究通常无法获得因果关系，而在国内研究中主要集中在低迷时期。我们首次对1999-2010年美国城市间跨行业商业周期的繁荣期进行了因果调查。利用一个新颖的研究设计，我们展示了私人标签抵押贷款的信贷扩张导致了高净出口增长地区房屋相关行业在繁荣期（2000-2006年）和低迷期（2007-2010年）的差异性更强的周期。最重要的是，我们独特的研究设计使我们能够对有关商业周期的理论（假设）进行最全面的测试。我们表明以下理论（假设）无法解释1999-2010年美国商业周期的原因：投机狂喜假说、实际商业周期理论、抵押品驱动的信用周期理论、商业不确定性理论以及外推期望理论",
