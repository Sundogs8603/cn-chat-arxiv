While a simple annotation system is often used to summarize the topics of customer contacts, thoroughly exploring each specific issue can be challenging. This presents a critical concern, especially during an emerging outbreak where companies must quickly identify and address specific issues. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel machine learning algorithm that leverages natural language techniques and topological data analysis to monitor emerging and trending customer issues. Our approach involves an end-to-end deep learning framework that simultaneously tags the primary question sentence of each customer's transcript and generates sentence embedding vectors. We then whiten the embedding vectors and use them to construct an undirected graph. From there, we define trending and emerging issues based on the topological properties of each transcript. W",

    "translated_abstract": "电子商务公司每天处理大量客户服务请求。尽管通常使用简单的注释系统来总结客户联系的主题，但深入探讨每个具体问题可能具有挑战性。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的机器学习算法，利用自然语言技术和拓扑数据分析来监控新兴和热门客户问题。我们的方法涉及一种端到端的深度学习框架，同时标记每个客户对话记录的主要问题句，并生成句子嵌入向量。然后我们对嵌入向量进行白化处理，并使用它们构建一个无向图。然后，我们根据每个对话记录的拓扑特性来定义热门和新兴问题。",
