    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.00707v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Identification of market abuse is an extremely complicated activity that requires the analysis of large and complex datasets. We propose an unsupervised machine learning method for contextual anomaly detection, which allows to support market surveillance aimed at identifying potential insider trading activities. This method lies in the reconstruction-based paradigm and employs principal component analysis and autoencoders as dimensionality reduction techniques. The only input of this method is the trading position of each investor active on the asset for which we have a price sensitive event (PSE). After determining reconstruction errors related to the trading profiles, several conditions are imposed in order to identify investors whose behavior could be suspicious of insider trading related to the PSE. As a case study, we apply our method to investor resolved data of Italian stocks around takeover bids.",

    "translated_abstract": "识别市场滥用是一项非常复杂的活动，需要分析大量复杂的数据集。我们提出了一种无监督机器学习方法，用于上下文异常检测，可以支持旨在识别潜在内幕交易活动的市场监控。该方法基于重建范式，采用主成分分析和自动编码器作为降维技术。该方法的唯一输入是每位投资者在对我们具有价格敏感事件（PSE）的资产上的交易位置。在确定与交易配置文件相关的重建错误后，我们会施加几个条件，以识别那些行为可疑的投资者，其行为可能涉及与PSE有关的内幕交易。作为案例研究，我们将我们的方法应用于围绕收购要约的意大利股票的投资者解析数据。",
