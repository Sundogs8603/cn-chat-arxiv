    "translated_abstract": "分析脑电图（EEG）时间序列可能具有挑战性，特别是在深度神经网络中，由于人类受试者之间的大量变异和通常规模较小的数据集。为了解决这些挑战，提出了各种策略，例如自监督学习，但它们通常依赖于广泛的实证数据集。受计算机视觉最新进展的启发，我们提出了一种预训练任务，称为“频率预训练”，通过预测随机生成的合成时间序列的频率内容来为睡眠分期预训练神经网络。我们的实验表明，我们的方法在有限数据和少受试者的情况下优于完全监督学习，并在许多受试者的情境中表现相匹配。此外，我们的结果强调了频率信息对于睡眠分期评分的相关性，同时表明深度神经网络利用了超出频率信息的信息。",
