In this paper, we comprehensively summarize and compare 34 representative studies conducted between 2009 and 2024. Firstly, we compare the data and methods used for modeling complementary relationships between products, including simple complementarity and more complex scenarios such as asymmetric complementarity, the coexistence of substitution and complementarity relationships between products, and varying degrees of complementarity between different pairs of products. Next, we classify and compare the models based on the research problems of complementary recommendation, such as diversity, personalization, and cold-start.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，互补推荐在电子商务领域受到了广泛关注。本文对2009年至2024年间进行的34项代表性研究进行了全面总结和比较。首先，我们比较了用于建模产品之间互补关系的数据和方法，包括简单的互补性以及更复杂的情景，例如非对称互补性、产品之间替代和互补关系共存，以及不同产品对之间的互补程度不同。接下来，我们根据互补推荐的研究问题对模型进行分类并进行比较，如多样性、个性化和冷启动等。此外，我们对不同研究在同一数据集上进行的实验结果进行比较分析，有助于确定研究的优势和劣势。",
