These strenuous hand motions often lead to musculoskeletal disorders and rehabilitation surgeries. We develop a data-driven ergonomic risk assessment system with a special focus on hand and finger activity to better identify and address ergonomic issues related to hand-intensive manufacturing processes. The system comprises a multi-modal sensor testbed to collect and synchronize operator upper body pose, hand pose and applied forces; a Biometric Assessment of Complete Hand (BACH) formulation to measure high-fidelity hand and finger risks; and industry-standard risk scores associated with upper body posture, RULA, and hand activity, HAL. Our findings demonstrate that BACH captures injurious activity with a higher granularity in comparison to the existing metrics. Machine learning models",

    "translated_abstract": "手工密集型制造过程，如复合材料铺设和纺织成形，需要显著的人体灵巧性以适应任务复杂性。这些繁重的手部动作往往导致肌肉骨骼疾病和康复手术。我们开发了一个数据驱动的人体工程学风险评估系统，特别关注手部和手指活动，以更好地识别和解决与手工密集型制造过程相关的人体工程学问题。该系统包括一个多模式传感器实验平台，用于收集和同步操作员上半身姿势、手部姿势和施加力量；一个用于测量高保真度手部和手指风险的Biometric Assessment of Complete Hand (BACH)配方；以及与上半身姿势、RULA和手部活动HAL相关的行业标准风险评分。我们的研究结果表明，BACH相比现有的指标能够更细致地捕捉有害活动。机器学习模型",
