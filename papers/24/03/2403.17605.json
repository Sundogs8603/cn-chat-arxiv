    "translated_abstract": "大规模不完全信息人口经济学的分析通常涉及整合一个随机变量连续谱。我们展示了Pettis（1938）积分概念在研究这类模型中的实用性。我们提出了关于Pettis积分的几个结果，包括Pettis可积性的方便充分条件和类似Fubini的可交换公式，通过一个运行示例进行了说明。在这些基础上，我们对拥有任意数量异质代理的贝叶斯博弈进行了统一分析。我们给出了关于收益结构的一个充分条件，该条件保证了在所有信号结构下均具有均衡唯一性。我们的条件是简明的，当战略互动是无向的时，它变得必要。我们进一步确定了对均衡行动状态联合分布加以的瞬时限制，这对信息设计者具有关键意义。",
