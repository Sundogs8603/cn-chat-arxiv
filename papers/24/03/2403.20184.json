    "translated_abstract": "自动语音质量评估作为传统感知临床评估的替代或支持近年来备受关注。然而，迄今为止大部分研究仅在简单任务（如二元分类）上取得了良好的结果，这主要是由于数据稀缺造成的。为了应对这一挑战，目前的研究倾向于将患者的音频文件分割成多个样本以增加数据集。然而，这种方法存在局限性，因为它将整体音频得分间接地与个别段相关联。本文提出了一种新颖的方法，即系统在整个音频级别学习，而不是在片段级别学习，尽管存在数据稀缺情况。本文建议在语音评估中使用预训练的Wav2Vec2架构进行自监督学习（SSL）和ASR作为特征提取器。在HNC数据集上进行了实验，我们的ASR驱动方法与其他方法相比建立了新的基线，实现了平均$MSE=0.73$和$MSE=1.15$来预测智商。",
