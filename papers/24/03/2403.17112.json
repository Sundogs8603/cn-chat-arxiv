    "translated_abstract": "这项研究对普拉德汉曼特里乌贾拉计划（PMUY）对印度贫困家庭LPG获取的影响进行了批判性评估。利用倾向得分匹配和双重差分估计器以及国家家庭健康调查（NFHS）数据集，研究发现实施PMUY后，受试者的平均处理效应在LPG消费上增加了2.1个百分点，同时火柴消费减少。区域分析显示不同的影响，北部、西部和南部取得了显著进展，但东部和东北部的影响不那么明显。研究还强调了不同社会群体之间的差异，表明最显著的好处是由社会阶层家庭获得的，而部落家庭几乎没有受到影响。尽管PMUY在促进LPG获取方面取得了初步成功，但维持其使用仍然具有挑战性。政策应强调有针对性的干预措施，增加收入支持。",
