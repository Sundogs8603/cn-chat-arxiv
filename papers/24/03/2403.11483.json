As only seen classes have human labels, they are usually better learned than novel classes, and thus exhibit smaller intra-class variances within the embedding space (named as imbalance of intra-class variances between seen and novel classes). Based on empirical and theoretical analysis, we find the variance imbalance can negatively impact the model performance. Pre-trained feature encoders can alleviate this issue via producing compact representations for novel classes. However, creating general pre-trained encoders for various types of graph data has been proven to be challenging.
