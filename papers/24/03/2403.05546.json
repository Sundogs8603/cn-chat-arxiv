    "translated_abstract": "在交通网络中，车上的乘客占座率对于了解旅客习惯并调整提供至关重要。传统上，运营商依靠实地研究评估典型工作日的乘车情况。然而，自动收费系统（AFC）和自动乘客计数（APC）数据往往可获得但未充分利用，提供了完整的时间覆盖。然而，需要注意的是，每种数据源都带有其自身的偏见：AFC数据可能无法考虑欺诈行为，而并非所有车辆都配备有APC系统。 本文引入了统一乘客占座率方法，这是一种地理统计模型，通过将AFC和APC数据与部分覆盖的范围相结合来推断公共交通网络内每趟车的乘客占座率。统一乘客占座率为在其他趟车有APC测量的线路上的某些趟车，以及在根本没有APC数据可用的线路上的某些趟车，补全了缺失的APC信息。",
