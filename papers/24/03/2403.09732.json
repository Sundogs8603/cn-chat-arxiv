Nevertheless, they face challenges when dealing with verbose database information and complex user intentions. This paper presents a two-stage framework to enhance the performance of current LLM-based natural language to SQL systems. We first introduce a novel prompt representation, called reference-enhanced representation, which includes schema information and randomly sampled cell values from tables to instruct LLMs in generating SQL queries. Then, in the first stage, question-SQL pairs are retrieved as few-shot demonstrations, prompting the LLM to generate a preliminary SQL (PreSQL). After that, the mentioned entities in PreSQL are parsed to conduct schema linking, which can significantly compact the useful information. In the second stage, with the linked schema, we simplify the ",

    "translated_abstract": "最近文本到SQL（Text2SQL）领域的进展强调刺激大型语言模型（LLM）进行上下文学习，取得了显著成果。然而，他们在处理冗长的数据库信息和复杂的用户意图时面临挑战。本文提出了一个两阶段框架，以增强当前基于LLM的自然语言到SQL系统的性能。我们首先引入了一种新颖的提示表示，称为参考增强表示，其中包括模式信息和从表格随机抽样的单元格值，以指导LLM生成SQL查询。然后，在第一阶段，我们检索问题-SQL对作为少量演示，促使LLM生成初步SQL（PreSQL）。之后，解析PreSQL中提到的实体进行模式链接，可以显著压缩有用信息。在第二阶段，利用链接的模式，我们简化了",
