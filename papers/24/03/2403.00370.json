    "translated_abstract": "端到端（E2E）方法正逐渐取代混合模型，用于自动语音识别（ASR）任务。然而，E2E模型的优化缺乏处理解码偏移的直观方法，尤其是在具有大量领域特定稀有单词且具有特定重要含义的情况下。此外，学术界缺乏知识密集型语音数据集一直是一个重要的限制因素，通常使用的语音语料库与现实对话存在显著差异。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了Medical Interview（MED-IT），一个包含大量知识密集型命名实体的多轮会诊语音数据集。我们还探讨了增强E2E模型对稀有单词识别性能的方法。我们提出了一种新颖的方法，即后解码器偏置，它基于训练转录的分布构建了一个转换概率矩阵。",
