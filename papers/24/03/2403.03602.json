Over the years, mean-value models have been proposed that can predict combustion measures (e.g., Gross Indicated Mean Effective Pressure, or the crank angle where 50% of the total heat is released) or models that predict the full in-cylinder pressure. However, these models are not able to capture cyclic variations. This is important in the control design for combustion concepts, like Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition, that can suffer from large cyclic variations.

    "translated_abstract": "气缸压力基础控制是先进的预混合燃烧概念的关键推动因素，除了确保稳健且安全的操作外，还可以实现气缸压力和热释放的塑造。这需要快速的面向控制的燃烧模型。多年来，已经提出了平均值模型，可以预测燃烧指标（例如，总的指示平均有效压力，或释放总热量的曲轴旋转角度），或者预测完整的气缸压力。然而，这些模型无法捕捉循环变化，这对于燃烧概念的控制设计至关重要，例如，反应性控制压缩点火，这可能会遭受大幅度的循环变化。在本研究中，使用基于数据的方法对气缸压力和循环变化进行了建模。该模型结合了主成分分解和高斯过程回归。进行了详细研究。",
