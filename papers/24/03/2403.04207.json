    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）是一种实用的方法，可以跨用户设备协作训练深度学习模型，通过在设备上保留原始数据来保护用户隐私。在FL中，参与的用户设备在硬件和软件配置方面高度碎片化。这种碎片化引入了一种新型数据异质性，即\\textit{系统诱导的数据异质性}，因为每个设备根据其硬件和软件配置生成不同的数据。在本文中，我们首先表征了系统诱导数据异质性对FL模型性能的影响。我们使用具有跨供应商和性能层级变化的异构设备收集了数据集。通过使用这个数据集，我们证明了\\textit{系统诱导的数据异质性}对准确性产生负面影响，并恶化了FL中的公平性和域泛化问题。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了HeteroSwitch，",
