Although there have been many efforts to understand factuality of LLM-created content and ability of LLMs to answer questions, it is not well understood how unclear or nonstandard language queries affect the model outputs. We propose the creation of a dataset that captures questions of digital newcomers and outsiders, utilizing data we have compiled from a decade's worth of one-on-one tutoring. In this paper we lay out our planned efforts and some potential uses of this dataset.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管大型语言模型的崛起开辟了学习数字技术的丰富新机会，但许多在技术边缘的人由于词汇或概念障碍而难以获得和保持能力，无法提出恰当的问题。虽然有许多努力去理解LLM创建内容的真实性以及LLM回答问题的能力，但人们并不太了解不清晰或非标准语言查询如何影响模型输出。我们提议创建一个捕捉数字新手和局外人问题的数据集，利用我们从十年一对一辅导中收集的数据。本文详细介绍了我们计划的努力和该数据集的一些潜在用途。",
