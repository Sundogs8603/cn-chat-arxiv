This approach capitalizes on the strengths of both paradigms: the adaptability of rule-based systems and the generalization power of neural networks. Our architecture consists of two components: a declarative rule-based model for transparent classification and a neural component to enhance rule generalizability through semantic text matching. Notably, our semantic matcher is trained in an unsupervised domain-agnostic way, solely with synthetic data. Further, these components are loosely coupled, allowing for rule modifications without retraining the semantic matcher.

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种新颖的神经符号架构，用于关系分类（RC），将基于规则的方法与当代深度学习技术相结合。这种方法充分发挥了两种范式的优势：基于规则的系统的适应性和神经网络的泛化能力。我们的架构由两个组件组成：一个用于透明分类的声明性基于规则的模型，以及一个通过语义文本匹配增强规则泛化能力的神经组件。值得注意的是，我们的语义匹配器仅通过合成数据在无监督领域无关方式进行训练。此外，这些组件松散耦合，允许对规则进行修改而无需重新训练语义匹配器。在我们的评估中，我们专注于两个少样本关系分类数据集：Few-Shot TACRED 和 Few-Shot 版本的 NYT29。我们展示了我们提出的方法优于先前的最先进模型",
