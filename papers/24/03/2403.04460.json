    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.04460v1 公告类型：新摘要：对话式推荐系统是一个新兴领域，尤其是随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的进步，使得对话输入的多样化推理引起了社区的越来越大的兴趣。尽管取得了进展，但该领域还有许多方面有待探索。目前可用的用于对话式推荐的公共数据集缺乏特定用户偏好和对推荐的解释，从而妨碍了高质量的推荐。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的对话式推荐数据集，命名为PEARL，与角色和知识增强的LLM模拟器相结合。我们从真实评论中获得详细的角色和知识，并构建了一个超过57k对话的大规模数据集。我们的实验结果表明，PEARL中的话语包括更具体的用户偏好，显示了在目标领域的专业知识，并提供了更相关的推荐。",
