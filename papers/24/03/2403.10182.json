    "translated_abstract": "在运筹学(OR)中，预测模型经常会遇到数据分布与训练数据分布不同的场景。近年来，神经网络(NNs)在图像分类等领域的出色性能使其在OR中备受关注。然而，当面对OOD数据时，NNs往往会做出自信但不正确的预测。不确定性估计为自信的模型提供了一个解决方案，当输出应(不应)被信任时进行通信。因此，在OR领域中，NNs中的可靠不确定性量化至关重要。由多个独立NNs组成的深度集合已经成为一种有前景的方法，不仅提供强大的预测准确性，还能可靠地估计不确定性。然而，它们的部署由于较大的计算需求而具有挑战性。最近的基础研究提出了更高效的NN集成，即sna",
