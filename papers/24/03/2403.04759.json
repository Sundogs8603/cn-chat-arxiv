    "translated_abstract": "On-device learning已经成为一种盛行趋势，它避免了云端学习的响应时间缓慢和沟通成本高昂。在变化环境中连续、无限地学习，并且受到资源约束，对于真实传感器部署至关重要。然而，现有设计对于具有(i)数据流输入、(ii)缺乏监督和(iii)有限板载资源的实际场景是不足够的。在本文中，我们设计并部署了第一个面向具有有限监理的一般物联网应用的边缘设备终生成长学习系统LifeHD。LifeHD 基于一种名为超高维计算（HDC）的新颖、轻量级的神经启发式学习范式而设计。我们利用两层联想记忆组织智能存储和管理高维、低精度向量，这些向量代表历史模式作为簇质心。我们还提出了两种变体",
