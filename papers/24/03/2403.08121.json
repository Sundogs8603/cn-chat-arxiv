The present work considers neural networks that are assumed to have locally Lipschitz gradients and an order of homogeneity strictly greater than two. This paper demonstrates that for sufficiently small initializations, during the early stages of training, the weights of the neural network remain small in norm and approximately converge in direction along the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points of the neural correlation function introduced in [1]. Additionally, for square loss and under a separability assumption on the weights of neural networks, a similar directional convergence of gradient flow dynamics is shown near certain saddle points of the loss function.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了训练深度齐次神经网络时梯度流动力学的动态性，这些网络从小初始化开始。本文考虑到具有局部Lipschitz梯度和阶数严格大于两的神经网络。文章证明了对于足够小的初始化，在训练的早期阶段，神经网络的权重保持规范较小，并且在Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)点处近似沿着神经相关函数的方向收敛。此外，对于平方损失并在神经网络权重上进行可分离假设的情况下，还展示了在损失函数的某些鞍点附近梯度流动动态的类似方向性收敛。",
