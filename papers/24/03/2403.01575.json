    "translated_abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)开创了一个新时代的故事创作者，为点燃创造力和探索未知叙事领域提供了强大的工具。随着技术的不断进步，人类创造力和AI生成内容之间的协同作用有可能重新定义叙事领域的格局。本文中，我们提出了SARD，一个通过大型语言模型生成多章节故事的可拖放式视觉界面。",
    "tldr": "SARD提出了一个新的人工智能与人类协作的故事生成工具, 旨在通过大型语言模型生成多章节故事，评估表明：节点式叙事的可视化可能帮助作者构建心智模型，但同时会给作者带来额外的心智负担，并在故事变得更加复杂时成为干扰源，AI生成的故事在词汇多样性上存在不足。",
    "en_tdlr": "SARD introduces a new Human-AI collaborative story generation tool, aiming to generate multi-chapter stories using large language models. Evaluation suggests that while node-based visualization of the narrative may help authors build a mental model, it also introduces unnecessary cognitive burden and distraction as the story complexity increases, with AI-generated stories showing less lexical diversity."
