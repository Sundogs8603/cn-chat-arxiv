Over the past decades, this field has generated an important body of knowledge, using experimental, historical, and computational methods. While computational models have been very successful at generating testable hypotheses about the effects of several factors, such as population structure or transmission biases, some phenomena have so far been more complex to capture using agent-based and formal models. This is in particular the case for the effect of the transformations of social information induced by evolved cognitive mechanisms.

    "translated_abstract": "文化演化研究旨在提供关于文化随时间变化的因果解释。过去几十年来，这一领域已经产生了重要的知识体系，利用了实验、历史和计算方法。虽然计算模型在生成关于诸多因素如人口结构或传播偏差影响的可检验假设方面非常成功，但某些现象迄今为止更难以使用基于代理人和形式模型来捕捉，尤其是由进化的认知机制引起的社会信息转变的影响。我们在这里提出，利用大型语言模型(LLMs)模仿人类行为的能力可能有助于解决这一差距。作为人类文化动态的有用近似，以生成代理为特征的多代理模型也是研究自身的重要工具。",
