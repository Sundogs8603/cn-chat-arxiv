    "translated_abstract": "最近，用于代码的大型语言模型（LLMs）受到了重视。它们可以基于提供的提示在不同的编程语言中生成代码，实现了软件工程（SE）中长期以来的一个梦想，即自动生成代码。与人类编写的代码类似，LLM生成的代码容易出现错误，但社区尚未对这些错误进行深入研究。鉴于软件工程活动中LLM-based代码生成工具（例如GitHub Copilot）的日益普及，了解LLMs生成代码中包含的缺陷特征至关重要。本文研究了使用三种主要LLM（即CodeGen、PanGu-Coder和Codex）生成的代码中收集的333个缺陷样本，并识别了以下10种独特的错误模式：误解、语法错误、愚蠢错误、提示偏向代码、遗漏角落案例、错误的输入类型、产生幻象对象、错误的属性、不完整（未完结）",
