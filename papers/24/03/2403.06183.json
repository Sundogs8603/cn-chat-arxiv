    "translated_abstract": "高维抽样问题中的计算复杂度的维度相关性是一个基本问题，无论是从实际还是理论的角度来看。相对于具有无偏稳态分布的抽样器，如Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA)，具有偏置稳态分布的抽样器，如Underdamped Langevin Dynamics (ULD)，在低准确度情况下表现更好，仅仅因为它们的复杂度对维度的依赖性更低。在此基础上，Freund等人(2022)提出，具有先前扩散的修改兰基文算法能够维度独立地收敛于强对数凹目标分布。然而，对于更一般的情况是否存在这样的性质仍然是一个未解之谜。在本文中，我们研究了对满足对数Sobolev不等式（LSI）的目标分布的先前扩散技术，该技术覆盖了比强对数凹分布更广泛的分布类。",
