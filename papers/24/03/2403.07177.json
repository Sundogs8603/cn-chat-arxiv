We analyze the dynamics of a duopoly market where both firms use pricing algorithms consisting of a parameterized family of model specifications. The firms update both the parameters and the weights on models to adapt endogenously to market outcomes. We show that the market experiences recurrent episodes where both firms set prices at collusive levels. We analytically characterize the dynamics of the model, using large deviation theory to explain the recurrent episodes of collusive outcomes. Our results show that collusive outcomes may be a recurrent feature of algorithmic environments with complementarities and endogenous adaptation, providing a challenge for competition policy.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了一个算法定价模型，可以在关闭所有明示或暗示的共谋渠道的同时产生共谋结果。我们分析了一个垄断市场的动态，其中两家公司使用包含参数化模型规范家族的定价算法。公司根据市场结果内生地调整参数和模型权重。我们展示了市场经历了周期性的事件，其中两家公司都将价格定在共谋水平。我们用大偏差理论来分析模型的动态，并解释了共谋结果的周期性事件。我们的结果表明，在具有互补性和内生适应性的算法环境中，共谋结果可能是一个经常出现的特征，为竞争政策提出了挑战。",
