    "translated_abstract": "我们生活的室内场景在视觉上是均质或无纹理的，但它们本质上具有结构形式，并为3D场景重建提供了足够的结构先验。受这一事实的启发，我们提出了一种针对室内场景特别是在亚特兰大世界（AW）假设下的结构感知在线有符号距离场（SDF）重建框架。因此，我们将这种增量SDF重建称为AiSDF。在在线框架内，我们推断给定场景的潜在亚特兰大结构，然后估计支持亚特兰大结构的平面surfel区域。这种亚特兰大感知的surfel表示为给定场景提供了明确的平面地图。此外，基于这些亚特兰大平面surfel区域，我们自适应地采样和约束SDF重建中的结构规律，从而通过保持高水平结构同时增强细节来提高重建质量。",
