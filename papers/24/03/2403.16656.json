Firstly, the lack of consideration for data noise in contrastive learning can result in noisy self-supervised signals, leading to degraded performance. Secondly, many existing GCL approaches rely on graph neural network (GNN) architectures, which can suffer from over-smoothing problems due to non-adaptive message passing.

    "translated_abstract": "Graph augmentation与对比学习在推荐系统领域引起了广泛关注，因为它能够在标记数据有限的情况下学习出富有表现力的用户表示。然而，直接将现有的GCL模型应用于现实推荐环境中存在挑战。主要问题有两个。首先，对比学习中忽略数据噪声可能导致嘈杂的自监督信号，从而降低性能。其次，许多现有的GCL方法依赖于图神经网络（GNN）架构，这可能由于非自适应信息传递而导致过度平滑问题。为解决这些挑战，我们提出了一个被称为GraphAug的原则性框架。该框架引入了一个强大的数据增强程序，生成去噪的自监督信号，提升推荐系统的性能。GraphAug框架还融入了图信息",
