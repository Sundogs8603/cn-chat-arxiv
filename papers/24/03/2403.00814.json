During legal case search, search engines retrieval a number of relevant cases from huge amounts of data and serve them to users. However, it is uncertain whether these cases are gender-biased and whether such bias has impact on user perceptions. We designed a new user experiment framework to simulate the judges' reading of relevant cases. 72 participants with backgrounds in legal affairs invited to conduct the experiment. Participants were asked to simulate the role of the judge in conducting a legal case search on 3 assigned cases and determine the sentences of the defendants in these cases.

    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年中，法律案例搜索已成为法律从业者工作的重要组成部分。在法律案例搜索中，搜索引擎从海量数据中检索出许多相关案例并提供给用户。然而，这些案例是否存在性别偏见，以及这种偏见是否会影响用户的认知，目前尚不确定。我们设计了一个新的用户实验框架来模拟法官阅读相关案例的过程。邀请了72名具有法律背景的参与者进行实验。参与者被要求模拟法官的角色，在3个指定的案例中进行法律案例搜索，并确定这些案例中被告的判决结果。同时对任务和相关案例中被告的性别进行编辑，以统计性地衡量法律案例搜索结果中性别偏见对参与者认知的影响。结果显示，法律案例搜索结果中存在性别偏见",
