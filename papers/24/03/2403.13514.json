    "translated_abstract": "神经语言模型在大多数自然语言处理任务上达到了最先进的结果，这些模型是在不可避免地包含价值负担内容的大型文本语料库上训练的，通常捕捉到不良偏见，这些偏见也会体现在模型中。这个案例研究关注捷克预训练编码器中的政治偏见，并将其与代表性价值调查进行比较。由于捷克是一种性别化语言，我们还衡量了语法性别与调查中对男性和女性回答的关系。我们引入了一种新颖的方法来衡量模型的政治价值观。我们发现模型在分配陈述概率时并不遵循基于价值的推理，并且女性和男性句子之间没有系统差异。我们得出结论，BERT大小的模型并不体现出与政治价值观的系统对齐，模型中观察到的偏见更多是由表面模仿引起的。",
