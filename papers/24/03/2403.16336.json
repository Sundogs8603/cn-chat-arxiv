We investigate two types of coverage suitable for these problems, extending the jackknife and split-conformal methods to show how to obtain distribution-free coverage in such non-traditional, hierarchical data-generating scenarios. Our contributions also include extensions for settings with non-real-valued responses and a theory of consistency for predictive inference in these general problems. We demonstrate a novel resizing method to adapt to problem difficulty, which applies both to existing approaches for predictive inference with hierarchical data and the methods we develop; this reduces prediction set sizes using limited information from the test environment, a key to the methods' practical performance, which we evaluate through neurochemical sensing and species classification datasets.",
