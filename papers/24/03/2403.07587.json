    "translated_abstract": "在当今数字化的环境中，网络日益中心化，引发对用户隐私侵犯的担忧。分布式 Web 架构（如 Solid）为用户提供了更好掌控个人“Pods”数据的解决方案。然而，一个重要挑战仍然存在：用户必须在众多应用程序间进行抉择，决定哪个应用程序可以被信任访问他们的数据 Pods。这通常涉及阅读冗长复杂的使用条款协议，用户往往觉得艰难或干脆忽视。这威胁了用户自主权，并阻碍了对数据滥用的检测。我们提出了一种新颖的数据使用条款（DToU）的形式化描述，以及一个 DToU 推理器。用户和应用程序会使用本地知识指定他们DToU政策的部分，涵盖权限，要求，禁止和义务。自动推理会验证合规性，同时推导政策...",
