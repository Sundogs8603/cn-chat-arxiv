To address these issues, this study proposes a behavior-based recommender system that leverages customers' natural behaviors, such as browsing and clicking, on e-commerce platforms. The proposed recommendation system involves clustering active customers, determining neighborhoods, collecting similar users, calculating product reputation based on similar users, and recommending high-reputation products. To overcome the complexity of customer behaviors and traditional clustering methods, an unsupervised clustering approach based on product categories is developed to enhance the recommendation methodology.

    "translated_abstract": "大多数现有的推荐系统依赖于用户评分，这受到用户协作欠缺和稀疏问题的限制。为了解决这些问题，本研究提出了一种基于行为的推荐系统，利用顾客在电子商务平台上的自然行为，如浏览和点击。提出的推荐系统涉及对活跃顾客进行聚类、确定邻域、收集相似用户、基于相似用户计算产品声誉以及推荐高声誉产品。为了克服顾客行为和传统聚类方法的复杂性，开发了一种基于产品类别的无监督聚类方法，以增强推荐方法。该研究在几个方面做出了显著贡献。",
