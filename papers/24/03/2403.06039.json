Despite its growing popularity, there remains an underexplored area concerning the specific domains where AI-generated content is being applied, and the methodologies content creators employ with Gen-AI tools during the creation process. This study initially explores this emerging area through a qualitative analysis of 68 YouTube videos demonstrating Gen-AI usage. Our research focuses on identifying the content domains, the variety of tools used, the activities performed, and the nature of the final products generated by Gen-AI in the context of user-generated content.",

    "translated_abstract": "内容创作者越来越多地利用生成式人工智能（Gen-AI）在YouTube、TikTok、Instagram和各种博客网站等平台上生成想象力十足的图像、AI生成视频和使用大型语言模型（LLM）的文章。尽管其日益普及，AI生成内容正在应用的具体领域以及内容创作者在创作过程中使用Gen-AI工具的方法仍然是一个尚未被深入探讨的领域。该研究通过对展示Gen-AI使用的68个YouTube视频进行定性分析，最初探讨了这一新兴领域。我们的研究重点是识别在用户生成内容背景下由Gen-AI生成的内容领域、使用的工具种类、执行的活动以及生成的最终产品的性质。",
