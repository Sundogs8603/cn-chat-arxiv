    "translated_abstract": "心血管疾病，包括心力衰竭（HF），仍然是全球主要的死亡原因，常常难以早期检测。在此背景下，可访问和有效的风险评估是不可或缺的。传统方法依赖于资源密集型的诊断测试，通常在症状发作后进行。心电图（ECG）技术的广泛可用性和机器学习的力量正成为智能医疗领域的可行替代方案。在本文中，我们提出了几种多模态方法，结合30秒ECG记录和近似的长期心率变异性（HRV）数据，来估算HF住院风险。我们引入了两种生存模型：一个XGBoost模型，用于加速失败时间（AFT），结合了全面的ECG特征；以及一个从原始ECG中学习的ResNet模型。我们通过我们从超级长期HRV中提取的新颖长期HRVs来扩展这些模型。",
