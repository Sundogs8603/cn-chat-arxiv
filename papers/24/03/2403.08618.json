    "translated_abstract": "标签错误，即训练样本具有不正确的标签，可能严重损害机器学习模型的性能。这种错误往往来自非专家标注或敌对攻击。获取大型、完全标记的数据集成本高，当有干净的数据集可用时，重新训练大型模型就变得计算昂贵。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了后训练校正，这是一种在初始训练后调整模型参数以减轻标签噪声的新范式，消除了重新训练的需要。我们引入了Verifix，这是一种基于奇异值分解（SVD）的新算法，利用一个小的、经过验证的数据集，通过单个更新校正模型权重。Verifix使用SVD估计干净激活空间，然后将模型的权重投影到这个空间上，以抑制对应于损坏数据的激活。我们展示了Verifix的有效性。",
