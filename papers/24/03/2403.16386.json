    "translated_abstract": "医学报告生成取得了显著进展，但仍面临一些挑战。首先，在正常和异常案例的分布上存在固有的不平衡，可能导致模型对正常样本展现出偏见，从而导致不可靠的诊断。其次，报告中常见模板句子的频繁出现可能淹没了关键的异常信息。此外，现有工作侧重于2D胸部X射线，由于CT图像的高维特性和CT-报告对的有限性，CT报告生成领域尚未得到充分探索。最近，LLM已经展示了通过适当的提示生成可靠答案的能力，这为解决上述挑战提供了启示。在本文中，我们提出了Dia-LLaMA，这是一个将LLaMA2-7B调整为CT报告生成的框架，通过引入诊断信息作为引导提示。考虑到高维度",
