    "translated_abstract": "最近，对大型语言模型（LLMs）的研究越来越受到关注，主要致力于扩展模型的上下文大小，以更好地捕捉长文档内部的依赖关系。尽管已经提出了用于评估长距离能力的基准，但现有的努力主要考虑的是不一定与现实应用相关的通用任务。相反，我们的工作提出了一个针对实际会议助理场景的长上下文LLMs的新基准。在这种情景下，长上下文由自动语音识别获得的转录组成，由于这些数据的固有嘈杂性和口语特性，这为LLMs提出了独特的挑战。我们的基准，名为ELITR-Bench，通过271个手工制作的问题及其真实答案来增强现有的ELITR语料库的转录。我们在ELITR-Bench上对最新的长上下文LLMs进行的实验凸显了开源模型和专有模型之间的差距。",
