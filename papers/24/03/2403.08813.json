    "translated_abstract": "尽管蜂窝网络技术取得了进展，基站（BS）负载平衡仍然是一个持久性问题。虽然集中资源分配方法可以解决负载平衡问题，但仍然是一个NP难问题。本研究研究了如何利用联合深度Q学习来通知每个用户设备（UE）各个BS的负载情况。联合深度Q学习的负载平衡使得智能UE可以独立选择最佳BS，同时限制了向网络暴露的私人信息量。",
    "tldr": "本研究提出并分析了一个联合深度Q学习负载平衡系统，利用Open-RAN xAPP框架和近实时射频接口控制器（near-RT RIC）实施。我们的模拟结果表明，与目前UE使用的最大信噪比（MAX-SINR）方法相比，我们提出的深度Q学习模型可以持续提供更好的负载平衡性能。",
