    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNN），也称为谱图滤波器，在网络图中有着广泛的应用。为了绕过特征分解，提出了使用各种多项式基准进行滤波器训练的多项式图滤波器，以近似图滤波器。然而，目前没有研究从统一的角度探讨多样化的多项式图滤波器进行优化。本文首先将多项式图滤波器以及相同次数的最优滤波器统一成同阶克里洛夫子空间，从而在理论上提供相同的表达能力。接下来，我们从统一的克里洛夫子空间角度研究多项式的渐近收敛属性，揭示了它们在具有不同异质程度的图中的有限适应性。受到这些事实的启发，我们设计了一种新颖的自适应克里洛夫子空间方法，以优化多项式基准，并可证明具有可控性。",
