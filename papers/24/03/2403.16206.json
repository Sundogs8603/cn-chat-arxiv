How to debunk rumors as early as possible remains a challenging problem. Existing studies mainly leverage information propagation structure to detect rumors, while very few works focus on correlation among users that they may coordinate to spread rumors in order to gain large popularity. In this paper, we propose a new detection model, that jointly learns both the representations of user correlation and information propagation to detect rumors on social media. Specifically, we leverage graph neural networks to learn the representations of user correlation from a bipartite graph that describes the correlations between users and source tweets, and the representations of information propagation with a tree structure. Then we combine the learned representations from these ",

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体上谣言的广泛传播对人们的日常生活造成了负面影响，导致公众产生潜在的恐慌、恐惧和心理健康问题。如何尽早揭穿谣言仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。现有研究主要利用信息传播结构来检测谣言，而很少有研究关注用户之间的相关性，即他们可能协调传播谣言以获得较大的流行度。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的检测模型，同时学习用户相关性和信息传播的表示，以便检测社交媒体上的谣言。具体而言，我们利用图神经网络从描述用户和来源推文之间相关性的二部图中学习用户相关性的表示，以及使用树结构学习信息传播的表示。然后，我们结合得到的表示",
