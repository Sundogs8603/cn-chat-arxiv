    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）显著推进了医疗保健创新的生成能力。然而，由于可能偏离医疗事实和固有偏见，它们在实际临床设置中的应用具有挑战性。在这项工作中，我们开发了一个增强型LLM框架KG-Rank，利用医学知识图谱（KG）与排名和重新排名技术，旨在改进医学领域自由文本问答（QA）。具体来说，在收到问题后，我们首先从医学KG中检索三元组以收集事实信息。随后，我们创新性地应用排名方法来精细调整这些三元组的顺序，旨在产生更精确的答案。据我们所知，KG-Rank是首个将排名模型与KG结合在一起，专门用于生成长答案的医学问答应用。对四个选定的医学问答数据集的评估显示，KG-Rank实现了",
