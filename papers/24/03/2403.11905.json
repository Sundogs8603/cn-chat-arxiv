For example, humans spend long hours of their time on web pages, where text is intertwined with other modalities and tasks are accomplished in the form of various complex interactions. Can state-of-the-art multi-modal models generalize to such complex domains?   To address this question, we introduce TurkingBench, a benchmark of tasks formulated as web pages containing textual instructions with multi-modal context. Unlike existing work which employs artificially synthesized web pages, here we use natural HTML pages that were originally designed for crowdsourcing workers for various annotation purposes. The HTML instructions of each task are also instantiated with various values (obtained from the crowdsourcing tasks) to form new instances of the task. This benchmark contains 32.2K instanc",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的聊天机器人展示了在原始文本形式下理解和交流的令人印象深刻的能力。然而，世界上不仅仅是原始文本。例如，人们在网页上花费大量时间，在这些网页上，文本与其他形式交织在一起，并以各种复杂互动的形式完成任务。最先进的多模型是否能够推广到这种复杂的领域呢？为了回答这个问题，我们介绍了TurkingBench，一个由包含多模态背景的文本说明制定的任务基准。与现有的使用人工合成的网页的工作不同，这里我们使用最初设计用于各种注释目的的自然HTML页面。每个任务的HTML说明也被实例化为各种值（从众包任务获得）以形成任务的新实例。这个基准包含32.2K个实例。",
