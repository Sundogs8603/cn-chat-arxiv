On the other hand, optimal statistical identification, via likelihood-based methods, is sensitive to the assumptions on the data distribution and is usually based on relatively complex sequential Monte Carlo algorithms. We develop a simple recursive online estimation algorithm based on an output-error predictor, for the identification of continuous-time stochastic parametric Wiener models through stochastic approximation.
