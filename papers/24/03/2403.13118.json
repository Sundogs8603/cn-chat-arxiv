    "translated_abstract": "模态分析已成为理解复杂流体的一种重要工具。传统的模态分析方法，如动态模态分解（DMD）和谱Proper Orthogonal Decomposition（SPOD），依赖于在时间上定期取样的充分数据量。然而，通常需要处理稀疏的时间不规则数据，例如由于实验测量和仿真算法。为了克服数据稀缺和不规则采样的限制，我们提出了一种使用多元高斯过程回归（MVGPR）的新型模态分析技术。我们首先从线性系统识别的角度建立了MVGPR与现有模态分析技术DMD和SPOD之间的联系。接下来，利用这种联系，我们开发了一种基于MVGPR的模态分析技术，以解决前述的限制。MVGPR的功能是通过其谨慎的判断能力赋予的。",
