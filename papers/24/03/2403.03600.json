Some existing CDR methods highlight the advantages of extracting domain-common and domain-specific features to learn comprehensive user and item representations. However, these methods can't effectively disentangle these components as they often rely on simple user-item historical interaction information (such as ratings, clicks, and browsing), neglecting the rich multi-modal features. Additionally, they don't protect user-sensitive data from potential leakage during knowledge transfer between domains. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Framework with Multi-Modal Data for Cross-Domain Recommendation, called P2M2-CDR.
