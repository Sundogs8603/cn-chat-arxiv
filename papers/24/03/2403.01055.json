    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）正在塑造写作工具中的一种新用户界面（UI）范式，使用户能够通过提示生成文本。这种范式将一些创作控制权从用户转移到系统，从而减弱用户在写作过程中的作者身份和自主性。为了恢复自主性，我们引入了Textfocals，一个旨在研究强调用户在写作中角色的以人为本的UI原型。Textfocals通过在文本编辑器的侧栏中提供LLM生成的摘要、问题和建议（即LLM视图），支持写作过程，鼓励在写作中进行反思和自主修订，而无需直接生成文本。Textfocals的UI功能，包括具有上下文适应性视图和用于提示选择和定制的支撑功能，为用户提供了一种新颖的与LLMs互动的方式，用户在其中保持对其写作的完整作者身份。与Textfocals进行的形成性用户研究",
