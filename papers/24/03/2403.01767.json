    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.01767v1 公告类型:新摘要:多标签文本分类（MLTC）是自然语言处理（NLP）领域中的一项基础任务，涉及将多个标签分配给给定文本。MLTC已经变得非常重要，并广泛应用于各个领域，如主题识别，推荐系统，情感分析和信息检索等。然而，传统的机器学习和深度神经网络尚未解决某些问题，例如，一些文档很简短但具有大量标签以及如何建立标签之间的关系。在MLTC领域，知识的重要性得到了证实是至关重要的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种名为知识增强文档-标签注意力网络（KeNet）的新方法。具体地，我们设计了一个注意力网络，该网络整合了外部知识、标签嵌入和一个全面的…（文章摘要截至）",
