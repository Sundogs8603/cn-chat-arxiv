To address this issue, more data needs to be collected from these countries, but the cost of annotation can be a significant bottleneck. In this paper, we propose methods to identify the data to be annotated to balance model performance and annotation costs.

    "translated_abstract": "当前的基础模型在各种任务中表现出色。然而，一些研究表明，由于训练过程中使用的数据在地理和经济上的不平衡表示，这些模型并不对每个人都有效。大多数数据来自西方国家，导致对代表性不足的国家的结果不佳。为了解决这个问题，需要从这些国家收集更多数据，但注释成本可能是一个重大瓶颈。在本文中，我们提出了一种方法来识别需要注释的数据，以平衡模型性能和注释成本。我们的方法首先涉及找到具有最大视觉差异的主题（物体和动作）图像的国家。接下来，我们确定了对于这些主题在视觉上更相似的国家，并表明利用这些国家可以提高模型性能，同时在注释成本方面节省开销。",
