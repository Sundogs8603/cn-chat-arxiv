    "translated_abstract": "图聚类是一个重要的无监督问题，已经被证明对图神经网络（GNNs）的进展更具抵抗力。此外，几乎所有的聚类方法都专注于同源图，忽略异源性。这严重限制了它们在实践中的适用性，因为现实世界图展现出结构不一致，不能简单地被归类为同源性和异源性。因此，迫切需要一种处理实际图的原则性方法。为了填补这一空白，我们提供了一个具有理论支持的新颖解决方案。有趣的是，我们发现大多数同源和异源边可以基于邻居信息被正确识别。受到这一发现的启发，我们构建了两个分别高度同源和异源的图。它们用于构建低通和高通滤波器以捕捉整体信息。重要的特征进一步由挤压-激励块增强。",
