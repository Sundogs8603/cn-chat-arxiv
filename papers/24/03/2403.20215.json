Previous efforts have largely focused on increasing lexical coverage while ignoring other qualitative aspects. In this paper, we focus on the Arabic language and introduce a major revision of the Arabic WordNet that addresses multiple dimensions of lexico-semantic resource quality. As a result, we updated more than 58% of the synsets of the existing Arabic WordNet by adding missing information and correcting errors.

    "translated_abstract": "高质量的WordNet对于依赖此类资源的NLP应用程序实现高质量结果至关重要。然而，大多数语言的WordNet存在严重的正确性和完整性问题，包括错误的词形、缺失的注释和例句，以及对语言的形态和语义的不足，体现了西方中心的表征。先前的努力主要集中在增加词汇覆盖率，而忽略了其他质量方面。在本文中，我们专注于阿拉伯语并介绍了阿拉伯语WordNet的重大修订，涵盖了词汇语义资源质量的多个维度。结果，我们通过添加缺失信息和纠正错误更新了现有阿拉伯语WordNet超过58%的同义词集。为了解决语言多样性和无法翻译性的问题，我们还扩展了",
