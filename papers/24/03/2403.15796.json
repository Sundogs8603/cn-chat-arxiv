In this paper, we propose to study emergent abilities in the lens of pre-training loss, instead of model size or training compute. We demonstrate that the models with the same pre-training loss, but different model and data sizes, generate the same performance on various downstream tasks. We also discover that a model exhibits emergent abilities on certain tasks -- regardless of the continuity of metrics -- when its pre-training loss falls below a specific threshold. Before reaching this threshold, its performance remains at the level of random guessing. This inspires us to redefine emergent abilities as those that",

    "translated_abstract": "近期研究质疑了传统认为语言模型的突现能力仅存在于大模型中的观点。这种怀疑源自两点观察：1）较小的模型也能展现出对突现能力的高性能；2）质疑用于测量这些能力的不连续性指标。本文提议从预训练损失的角度研究突现能力，而非模型大小或训练计算。我们展示了具有相同预训练损失但不同模型和数据大小的模型，在各种下游任务上表现相同。我们还发现，当某一模型的预训练损失低于特定阈值时，在某些任务上表现出突现能力，而不论指标的连续性如何；而在达到该阈值之前，其性能仍保持在随机猜测水平。这启发我们重新定义突现能力为那些......",
