    "translated_abstract": "要在知识图谱（KG）上推导新的事实，链接预测器从图结构中学习，并收集局部证据以找到对给定查询的答案。然而，现有方法由于利用整个KG进行预测而存在严重的可扩展性问题，这阻碍了它们在大规模KG上的应用，并且无法直接通过常规抽样方法解决。 在这项工作中，我们提出了一次性子图链接预测以实现高效且自适应的预测。 设计原则是，预测过程不直接作用于整个KG，而是分为两个步骤，即（i）根据查询仅提取一个子图和（ii）在这个单一的、查询相关的子图上进行预测。 我们发现，非参数化和计算高效的启发式方法个性化PageRank（PPR）可以有效地识别潜在答案和支持证据。",
