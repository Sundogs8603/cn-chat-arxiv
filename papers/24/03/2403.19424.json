Unfortunately, the currently used methods for attributing token importance often yield diverging patterns. In this work, we study potential sources of disagreement across methods from a linguistic perspective. We find that different methods systematically select different classes of words and that methods that agree most with other methods and with humans display similar linguistic preferences. Token-level differences between methods are smoothed out if we compare them on the syntactic span level. We also find higher agreement across methods by estimating the most important spans dynamically instead of relying on a fixed subset of size $k$. We systematically investigate the interaction between $k$ and spans and propose an improved configuration for selecting important tokens.",

    "translated_abstract": "事后解释方法是增加模型透明度对用户来说是一个重要工具。不幸的是，目前用于归因标记重要性的方法经常产生不同的模式。在这项工作中，我们从语言学角度研究了方法之间不一致的潜在来源。我们发现不同的方法系统地选择不同类别的词，并且那些与其他方法和人类达成最高一致性的方法展现出类似的语言偏好。如果我们在句法跨度水平上比较方法，那么方法之间的标记级差异就会被平滑掉。通过动态估计最重要的跨度而不是依赖于固定大小为$k$的子集，我们发现方法之间的一致性更高。我们系统地调查了$k$和跨度之间的交互作用，并提出了一个用于选择重要标记的改进配置。",
