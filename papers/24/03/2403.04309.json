Specifically, to address the feature coupling issue caused by overlapping phenomena, we introduce the Category-Specific One-to-One Assignment (CSA) strategy to constrain category-specific object queries in predicting prohibited items of fixed categories, which can enhance their ability to extract features specific to prohibited items of a particular category from the overlapping foreground-background features.

    "translated_abstract": "X射线图像中的禁止物品检测是各种安全检查场景中广泛采用的最重要和高效的方法之一。考虑到X射线禁止物品图像中显著的重叠现象，我们提出了一种基于最先进的通用物体检测器DINO的反重叠DETR（AO-DETR）。具体地，为了解决由于重叠现象导致的特征耦合问题，我们引入了特定类别的一对一分配（CSA）策略，以限制类别特定的物体查询来预测固定类别的禁止物品，可以增强它们提取特定类别禁止物品特征能力。从重叠的前景-背景特征中获取。为了解决重叠现象导致的边缘模糊问题，我们提出了Look Forward Densely（LFD）方案，可以提高参考框的定位准确性。",
