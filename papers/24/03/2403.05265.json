However, the massive spoiler reviews detract from the movie-watching experience, making spoiler detection an important task. Previous methods simply focus on reviews' text content, ignoring the heterogeneity of information in the platform. For instance, the metadata and the corresponding user's information of a review could be helpful. Besides, the spoiler language of movie reviews tends to be genre-specific, thus posing a domain generalization challenge for existing methods. To this end, we propose MMoE, a multi-modal network that utilizes information from multiple modalities to facilitate robust spoiler detection and adopts Mixture-of-Experts to enhance domain generalization. MMoE first extracts graph, text, and meta feature from the user-movie network, the review's textual content, and the review's metadata respectively. To handle genre-specific spo",

    "translated_abstract": "在线电影评论网站对于电影信息和讨论是非常有价值的。然而，大量的剧透评论会影响观影体验，因此剧透检测变得非常重要。先前的方法通常只关注评论的文本内容，忽略了平台中信息的异质性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了MMoE，一个利用多模态信息进行剧透检测的网络，并采用专家混合技术来增强领域泛化能力。MMoE首先从用户-电影网络中提取图表、文本和元数据特征，分别从评论的文本内容和评论的元数据中提取信息。为了处理特定类型电影评论中的剧透语言。",
