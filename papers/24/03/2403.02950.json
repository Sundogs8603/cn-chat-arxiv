    "translated_abstract": "后门攻击一直是深度神经网络（DNN）面临的新兴安全威胁之一，导致严重后果。其中一种主流后门防御方法是基于模型重建的。这些防御采用模型遗忘或剪枝来消除后门。然而，对于如何从这些防御中幸存下来却鲜有研究。为了弥合这一差距，我们提出了Venom，这是第一个通用的后门攻击增强器，用于提高现有后门攻击对基于模型重建的防御的生存能力。我们将Venom形式化为一个二元任务优化问题。其中一个任务是原始后门攻击任务，以保留原始攻击能力，而另一个任务是攻击增强任务，以提高攻击的生存能力。为了实现第二个任务，我们提出了关注模仿损失，来强制后门模型中受损样本的决策路径与良性样本的关键决策路径耦合。",
