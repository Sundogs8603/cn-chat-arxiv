    "translated_abstract": "基于图的方法在许多现实世界应用中对相互连接的对象进行标签推断至关重要，然而，如果用于模型训练的图与用于测试的图有显著差异，往往会遇到泛化挑战。本工作深入探讨了图领域自适应（GDA）以解决图数据分布转移的独特复杂性，其中相互连接的数据点经历特征、标签和尤其是连接模式的转移。我们提出了一种新颖的、在理论上合理的方法，一对一对齐（Pair-Align），通过减轻条件结构转移（CSS）和标签转移（LS）来对抗图结构转移。Pair-Align使用边权重重新校准邻近节点之间的影响以处理CSS，并通过标签权重调整分类损失以处理LS。我们的方法在包括区域节点分类在内的现实世界应用中表现出优越的性能。",
