To address this challenge, our work introduces Collage Prompting, a budget-friendly prompting approach that concatenates multiple images into a single visual input. With collage prompt, GPT-4V is able to perform image recognition on several images simultaneously. Based on the observation that the accuracy of GPT-4V's image recognition varies significantly with the order of images within the collage prompt, our method further learns to optimize the arrangement of images for maximum recognition accuracy.

    "translated_abstract": "最近生成式人工智能的进展表明，通过采用视觉提示，GPT-4V可以在图像识别任务中展现出显著的熟练度。尽管其令人印象深刻的能力，但与GPT-4V的推断相关的财务成本构成了其广泛应用的重大障碍。为了解决这一挑战，我们的研究引入了Collage Prompting，这是一种经济实惠的提示方法，将多个图像连接成单个视觉输入。借助拼贴提示，GPT-4V可以同时在多幅图像上执行图像识别。基于GPT-4V的图像识别准确性与拼贴提示中图像顺序明显变化的观察，我们的方法进一步学习优化图像安排以获得最大的识别准确性。训练了一个图预测器来指示每个拼贴提示的准确性，然后我们提出了一种优化方法来导航搜索空间。",
