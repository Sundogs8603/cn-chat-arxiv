Relevance feedback techniques with implicit user feedback (e.g., clicks) have been demonstrated to be effective in traditional search tasks (e.g., Web search).

First, legal case retrieval is a complex task as users often need to understand the relationship between legal cases in detail to correctly judge their relevance. Traditional feedback signal such as clicks is too coarse to use as they do not reflect any fine-grained relevance information. Second, legal case documents are usually long, users often need even tens of minutes to read and understand them. Simple behavior signal such as clicks and eye-tracking fixations can hardly be useful when users almost click and examine",

    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.13242v1 公告类型：新摘要：在过去的十年中，法律案例检索的任务受到了信息检索领域的越来越多的关注。具有隐式用户反馈（例如点击）的相关反馈技术已被证明在传统搜索任务（例如网络搜索）中是有效的。然而，在法律案例检索中，收集相关反馈面临一些难以在现有反馈范式下解决的挑战。首先，法律案例检索是一个复杂的任务，因为用户通常需要详细了解法律案例之间的关系才能正确判断它们的相关性。传统的反馈信号（例如点击）太粗糙了，因为它们不反映任何细粒度的相关信息。其次，法律案例文件通常很长，用户通常需要甚至十几分钟来阅读和理解它们。当用户几乎点击和检查时，简单的行为信号（例如点击和注视跟踪）几乎没有用处。",
