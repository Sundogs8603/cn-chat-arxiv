Most existing uplift methods only use individual data, which are usually not informative enough to capture the unobserved and complex hidden factors regarding the uplift. Furthermore, uplift modeling scenario usually has scarce labeled data, especially for the treatment group, which also poses a great challenge for model training. Considering that the neighbors' features and the social relationships are very informative to characterize a user's uplift, we propose a graph neural network-based framework with two uplift estimators, called GNUM, to learn from the social graph for uplift estimation. Specifically, we design the first estimator based on a class-transformed target. The estimator is general for all types of outcomes, and is able to comprehensively model the treatment",

    "translated_abstract": "提升建模旨在测量从随机实验或观测数据中的策略或行动对用户的增量效应，我们称之为提升。大多数现有的提升方法仅使用个体数据，这些数据通常不足以捕捉有关提升的未观察到和复杂的隐藏因素。此外，提升建模场景通常具有稀缺的标记数据，尤其是对于处理组，这也对模型训练构成了巨大挑战。考虑到邻居的特征和社会关系对于表征用户的提升非常有信息量，我们提出了一种基于图神经网络的框架，其中包括两个提升估计器，称为GNUM，以从社交图中学习提升估计。具体地，我们设计了基于类变换目标的第一个估计器。该估计器适用于所有类型的结果，并且能够全面地建模处理组",
