    "translated_abstract": "深度模型的性能，包括视觉Transformer，已知容易受到对抗性攻击的影响。许多现有对抗性防御方法，如对抗性训练，依赖于对整个模型进行全面微调以增加模型的稳健性。这些防御方法需要为每个任务存储整个模型的副本，而模型可能包含数十亿个参数。与此同时，参数高效的prompt调优被用来适应大型基于Transformer的模型到下游任务，无需保存大型副本。本文从稳健性的角度研究了对视觉Transformer进行下游任务的参数高效prompt调优。我们发现，之前的对抗性防御方法在应用到prompt调优范式时，存在梯度模糊并容易受到自适应攻击的影响。我们引入了ADAPT，一种在prompt调优范式中执行自适应对抗训练的新框架。",
