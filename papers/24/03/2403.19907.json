    "translated_abstract": "图上的节点分类在许多应用中至关重要。由于现实世界开放场景中标记能力有限且发展迅速，未标记测试节点上可能会出现新类别。然而，目前对图上的新类别发现关注较少。由于图中的新类别和已知类别节点由边相关联，因此当应用消息传递GNN时它们的表示是不可区分的。此外，新类别缺乏标签信息来指导学习过程。本文提出了一种新方法Open-world gRAph neuraL network (ORAL)来解决这些挑战。ORAL首先通过半监督原型学习检测类别之间的相关性。然后通过原型注意力网络消除类间相关性，从而为不同类别提供独特的表示。此外，为了充分探索mu",
