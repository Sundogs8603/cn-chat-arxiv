    "translated_abstract": "人类活动加速了化石燃料的消耗并产生了温室气体，导致了当今迫在眉睫的问题：全球变暖和气候变化。这些间接造成严重的自然灾害，许多生命受苦以及农业财产的巨大损失。为了减轻对我们土地的影响，科学家们正在开发可再生、可重复使用和清洁能源，气候学家正试图预测极端天气。同时，各国政府正在公布节约资源的政策，以建立更环保的社会并唤起环境意识。其中最具影响力的因素之一就是降水，将凝结的水蒸气带到土地上。水资源是社会中最重要但基本的需求，不仅支持我们的生活，也支持经济。在台湾，尽管平均年降水量高达2500毫米，但每人的水分配量低于全球平均水平，这是由于...",
