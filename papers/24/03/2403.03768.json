    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.03768v1 公告类型：新摘要：药物开发领域和治疗应用领域都面临着重大挑战。治疗领域需要更多的治疗选择，同时大量有前景的临床前药物在临床试验中失败。一个原因是在药物开发的后期阶段交叉药物反应评估（CRE）的不足。尽管计算机模拟的CRE模型为解决这一问题提供了一种解决方案，但现有方法学要么局限于早期开发阶段，要么缺乏对全面CRE分析的能力。在这里，我们介绍了一种名为DeepCRE的新型计算模型，并展示了DeepCRE在推动治疗发现和发展方面的潜力。DeepCRE通过实现患者级别CRE平均性能提高17.7\\%，指示级别CRE增加了5倍，优于现有最佳模型。此外，DeepCRE已经确定了六个显示出明显更大优势的药物候选者。",
