    "translated_abstract": "自监督学习（SSL）已被证明能够有效地学习高质量的表示，用于各种下游任务，主要关注语义任务。然而，在几何任务中的应用仍未得到充分探索，部分原因是缺乏用于评估几何表示的标准化评估方法。为了填补这一空白，我们引入了一个新的姿势估计基准，用于评估SSL几何表示，该基准要求在没有语义或姿势标签的情况下进行训练，并在语义和几何下游任务中表现出熟练度。在这个基准上，我们研究了如何增强SSL几何表示而不牺牲语义分类准确性。我们发现利用中间层表示可以将姿势估计性能提高10-20％。此外，我们引入了一种无监督轨迹正则化损失，该损失额外提高了4％的性能，并提高了在越界上的泛化能力。",
