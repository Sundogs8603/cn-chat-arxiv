    "translated_abstract": "检测异常对于识别业务流程中的低效率、错误或欺诈行为至关重要。传统的流程挖掘方法集中在分析基于单一案例概念的'扁平化'、顺序事件日志。然而，许多真实世界的流程执行展现出类似图形的结构，其中事件可以与多个案例相关联。将事件日志扁平化需要选择单个案例标识符，这导致与真实事件数据存在差距并在事件日志中人为引入异常。面向对象的流程挖掘通过允许事件与不同案例相关联来避免这些限制。该研究提出了一个利用图神经网络和面向对象的流程挖掘提供的增强信息进行业务流程异常检测的新框架。我们首先将面向对象的事件日志的过程依赖关系重建和表示为带属性的图，然后...",
