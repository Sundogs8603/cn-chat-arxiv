    "translated_abstract": "尽管许多机器学习方法被开发或移植到黎曼流形上，以应对具有已知非欧几何结构的数据，在这些空间中对最优输运（Optimal Transport, OT）方法却没有得到太多关注。在欧几里得空间中，一种流行的替代方法是切片-华塞斯坦距离，该方法利用了一维华塞斯坦距离的封闭形式解决方案，但在流形上无法直接使用。在这项工作中，我们推导了卡坦-哈达玛德流形上切片-华塞斯坦距离的一般构造，这些流形是具有非正曲率的黎曼流形，其中包括了双曲空间或对称正定矩阵空间等。然后，我们提出了不同的应用。此外，我们推导了非参数方案来最小化这些新距离，通过近似它们的华塞斯坦距离。",
