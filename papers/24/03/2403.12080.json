Past studies have focused on manually analyzing the behavior of the frost cycle in the northern mid-latitude region of Mars using high-resolution visible observations from orbit. Extending these studies globally requires automating the detection of frost using data science techniques such as convolutional neural networks. However, visible indications of frost presence can vary significantly depending on the geologic context on which the frost is superimposed. In this study, we (1) present a novel approach for spatially partitioning data to reduce biases in model performance estimation, (2) illustrate how geologic context affects automated frost detection, and (3) propose mitigations to observed biases in automated frost detection.",

    "translated_abstract": "火星表面的季节性结霜和融冰被假设推动着气候过程以及形成和演化地貌特征，如冲沟。过去的研究集中于使用来自轨道高分辨率可见光观测手动分析火星北半球中纬度地区霜冻周期的行为。全球扩展这些研究需要利用数据科学技术，如卷积神经网络，自动检测霜冻。然而，霜冻存在的可见指标可能会根据霜冻所叠加的地质背景而有显著变化。在这项研究中，我们(1)提出了一种新颖的空间数据分区方法，以减少模型性能估计中的偏差，(2)说明了地质背景如何影响自动霜冻检测，(3)提出了缓解自动霜冻检测中观察到的偏差的方法。",
