    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.13827v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: This paper presents a novel self-supervised path-planning method for UAV-aided networks. First, we employed an optimizer to solve training examples offline and then used the resulting solutions as demonstrations from which the UAV can learn the world model to understand the environment and implicitly discover the optimizer's policy. UAV equipped with the world model can make real-time autonomous decisions and engage in online planning using active inference. During planning, UAV can score different policies based on the expected surprise, allowing it to choose among alternative futures. Additionally, UAV can anticipate the outcomes of its actions using the world model and assess the expected surprise in a self-supervised manner. Our method enables quicker adaptation to new situations and better performance than traditional RL, leading to broader generalizability.",
