It contains a wide variety of tools, ranging from the simplest tasks, such as sentence splitting and text normalization, to the more advanced ones, such as text and token classification models. Its token classification models are based on \"Context Model\", a novel architecture that is both an encoder and an auto-regressive model. NLP tasks solved by VNLP models include but are not limited to Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition, Morphological Analysis \\& Disambiguation and Part-of-Speech Tagging.
