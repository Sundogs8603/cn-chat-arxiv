    "translated_abstract": "真实世界中的系统通常表现出受各种参数影响的动态，这些参数可以是固有的也可以是外部可控的，因此需要能够可靠捕捉这些参数行为的模型。等离子体技术是这种系统的典型例子。例如，主导霍尔推进器（一种航天器推进技术）全局动态的现象会随着各种参数变化，比如“自维持电场”。在本文第二部分中，继续在第一部分中介绍了我们的新颖数据驱动局部算子查找算法Phi Method后，我们展示了该方法在学习参数动力学方面的有效性，以预测系统在未见参数空间中的行为。我们提出了两种改进：参数化Phi Method和集合Phi Method，并通过二维流体-穿过圆柱和一维霍尔推进器等离子放电问题进行了演示。在流体案例中与参数化OPT-DMD进行了比较评估。",
