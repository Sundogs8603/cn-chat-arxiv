PyVRP combines the flexibility of Python with the performance of C++, by implementing (only) performance critical parts of the algorithm in C++, while being fully customisable at the Python level. PyVRP is a polished implementation of the algorithm that ranked 1st in the 2021 DIMACS VRPTW Challenge and, after improvements, ranked 1st on the static variant of the EURO Meets NeurIPS 2022 Vehicle Routing Competition. The code follows good software engineering practices, and is well-documented and unit tested. PyVRP is freely available under the liberal MIT license.
