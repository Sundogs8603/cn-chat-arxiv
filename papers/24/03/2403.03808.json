    "translated_abstract": "自我反思我们的表现（例如，我们的自信程度）在进行任务之前对于决策是至关重要的，比如选择最合适的工具或选择最佳驾驶路线。虽然这种意识形式——思考我们的表现或元认知表现——在人类中是众所周知的，但机器人仍然缺乏这种认知能力。这种反思监控可以增强他们的体现决策能力、鲁棒性和安全性。在这里，我们朝着这个方向迈出了一步，通过引入一个数学框架，使机器人能够利用他们的控制自信心做出更加明智的决定。我们推导了一个用于动态系统的控制自信度的数学闭合形式表达式（即控制动作的后验逆协方差）。这种控制自信度无缝地集成在一个用于决策制定的客观函数中，平衡了：i）任务完成的性能，ii）控制努力",
