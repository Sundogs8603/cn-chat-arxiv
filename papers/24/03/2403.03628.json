    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.03628v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Topic modeling seems to be almost synonymous with generating lists of top words to represent topics within large text corpora. However, deducing a topic from such list of individual terms can require substantial expertise and experience, making topic modelling less accessible to people unfamiliar with the particularities and pitfalls of top-word interpretation. A topic representation limited to top-words might further fall short of offering a comprehensive and easily accessible characterization of the various aspects, facets and nuances a topic might have. To address these challenges, we introduce GPTopic, a software package that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to create dynamic, interactive topic representations. GPTopic provides an intuitive chat interface for users to explore, analyze, and refine topics interactively, making topic modeling more accessible and comprehensive.

    "translated_abstract": "主题建模似乎几乎等同于生成列出顶部单词以表示大型文本语料库中的主题。然而，从这样一列个别术语中推断主题可能需要大量的专业知识和经验，使得主题建模对于对特定顶词解释的细微差别和缺陷不熟悉的人群不够易用。仅限于顶词的主题表示可能进一步无法提供主题可能具有的各个方面、方面和细微差别的全面且易于访问的表征。为了解决这些挑战，我们介绍了GPTopic，一个利用大型语言模型（LLMs）创建动态，交互式主题表示的软件包。GPTopic提供直观的聊天界面，供用户交互地探索、分析和完善主题，使主题建模更易使用和全面。相应的代码可在此处找到：https://gith",
