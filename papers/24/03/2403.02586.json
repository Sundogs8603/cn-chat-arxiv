    "translated_abstract": "零样本事件检测上现有的方法通常在已知事件类型注释的数据集上训练模型，并提示它们使用未见过的事件定义。这些方法偶尔取得成功，但总体表现不尽如人意。本文旨在通过训练模型更好地遵循事件定义来改进零样本事件检测。我们假设一组多样化的事件类型和定义是模型学习遵循事件定义的关键，而现有的事件提取数据集侧重于为少数事件类型注释许多高质量示例。为验证我们的假设，我们构建了一个自动生成的多样化事件定义（DivED）数据集，并进行了比较研究。我们的实验显示，大量事件类型（200个）和多样化的事件定义可以显著提升事件提取性能；另一方面，性能不会随着超过十个事件类型的增加而增长。",
