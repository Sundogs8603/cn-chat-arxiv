    "translated_abstract": "法律自治 - 人工智能代理的合法活动 - 可以通过两种方式实现。一种方式是对AI行为者（如开发者、部署者和用户）和AI资源（如数据）施加约束，或者是对AI代理在环境中可能产生影响的范围和影响程度施加约束。后一种方法涉及将关于由AI驱动的设备的现有规则编码到控制这些设备的AI代理软件中（例如，将关于无人机设备操作范围限制的规则编码到无人机设备的代理软件中）。然而，这是一个挑战，因为这种方法的有效性需要一种提取、加载、转换和计算法律信息的方法，这种方法既可解释又可在法律上相互操作，并能让AI代理推理法律。本文中，我们将概述使用大型语言模型、专家系统和贝叶斯网络证明这种方法的原理。",
