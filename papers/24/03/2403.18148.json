Here, we had these models generate empathic messages in response to posts describing common life experiences, such as workplace situations, parenting, relationships, and other anxiety- and anger-eliciting situations. Across two studies (N=192, 202), we showed human raters a variety of responses written by several models (GPT4 Turbo, Llama2, and Mistral), and had people rate these responses on how empathic they seemed to be. We found that LLM-generated responses were consistently rated as more empathic than human-written responses. Linguistic analyses also show that these models write in distinct, predictable ``styles\", in terms of their use of punctuation, emojis, and certain words. These results highlight the potential of using LLMs to enhance human peer support in contexts where empathy is i",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在许多任务中表现出令人惊讶的性能，包括撰写显示共情的支持性消息。在这项研究中，我们让这些模型根据描述常见生活经历的帖子生成共情消息，如工作场景、育儿、人际关系以及其他引发焦虑和愤怒的情况。在两项研究中（N=192，202），我们向人类评分员展示了由几种模型（GPT4 Turbo，Llama2 和 Mistral）撰写的各种回复，并让人们根据这些回复在共情程度上评分。我们发现，LLM 生成的回复被一致评为比人类撰写的回复更具共情性。语言分析还表明，这些模型在使用标点符号、表情符号和某些词汇方面具有明显、可预测的“风格”。这些结果凸显了在需要共情的情境中利用LLMs提升人类同行支持的潜力。",
