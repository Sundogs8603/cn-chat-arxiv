    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.09226v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Electronic health records (EHR) and claims data are rich sources of real-world data that reflect patient health status and healthcare utilization. Querying these databases to answer epidemiological questions is challenging due to the intricacy of medical terminology and the need for complex SQL queries. Here, we introduce an end-to-end methodology that combines text-to-SQL generation with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to answer epidemiological questions using EHR and claims data. We show that our approach, which integrates a medical coding step into the text-to-SQL process, significantly improves the performance over simple prompting. Our findings indicate that although current language models are not yet sufficiently accurate for unsupervised use, RAG offers a promising direction for improving their capabilities, as shown in a realistic industry setting.",

    "translated_abstract": "电子健康记录（EHR）和索赔数据是反映患者健康状况和医疗利用情况的丰富现实世界数据来源。查询这些数据库以回答流行病学问题具有挑战性，原因在于医学术语的复杂性和对复杂SQL查询的需求。我们介绍了一种端到端的方法，将文本到SQL生成与检索增强生成（RAG）结合起来，使用EHR和索赔数据回答流行病学问题。我们展示了我们的方法，将医学编码步骤整合到文本到SQL过程中，显著提高了性能，而不仅仅是简单提示。我们的研究结果表明，尽管当前的语言模型尚不足以无监督使用，但RAG为改进它们的能力提供了一个有希望的方向，如在一个现实的行业环境中所示。",
