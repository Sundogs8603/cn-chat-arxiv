    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.01346v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Active learning is a learning strategy whereby the machine learning algorithm actively identifies and labels data points to optimize its learning. This strategy is particularly effective in domains where an abundance of unlabeled data exists, but the cost of labeling these data points is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we consider cases of binary classification, where acquiring a positive instance incurs a significantly higher cost compared to that of negative instances. For example, in the financial industry, such as in money-lending businesses, a defaulted loan constitutes a positive event leading to substantial financial loss. To address this issue, we propose a shifted normal distribution sampling function that samples from a wider range than typical uncertainty sampling. Our simulation underscores that our proposed sampling function limits both noisy and positive label selection, delivering between 20% and 32% improved cost ",

    "translated_abstract": "主动学习是一种学习策略，即机器学习算法主动识别和标记数据点以优化其学习过程。该策略在存在大量未标记数据的领域特别有效，但标记这些数据点的成本过高。本文考虑了二元分类的情况，其中获取正实例的成本明显高于负实例的成本。",
