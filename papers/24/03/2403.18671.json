    "translated_abstract": "评估日常言论的真实性耗时且在某些情况下需要领域专业知识。我们通过实证证明，常用的事实核查流程，即检索器-阅读器，在使用一个领域的标记数据进行训练后，当在另一个领域中使用时性能会下降。之后，我们深入研究了流程的每个组成部分，并提出了新颖的算法来解决这个问题。我们提出了一种对抗算法，使检索器组件能够抵御分布转移。我们的核心思想是首先在标记的源数据上训练一个双编码器，然后通过使用未标记的目标数据对两个独立的文档编码器和言论编码器进行对抗训练。然后我们专注于阅读器组件，并建议训练它以对言论和证据文档的顺序不敏感。我们的实证评估支持这样一个阅读器显示出更高的性能。",
