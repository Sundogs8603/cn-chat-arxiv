However, too often, they are unnecessarily complex and hard to use, requiring deep domain and technical knowledge. These characteristics often limit the engagement of law enforcement and end-users in these technologies that, despite their potential, remain misunderstood. For this reason, in this study, we describe our experience in combining learning and training methods and the potential benefits of gamification to enhance technology transfer and increase adult learning. In fact, in this case, participants are experienced practitioners in professions/industries that are exposed to terrorism financing (such as Law Enforcement Officers, Financial Investigation Officers, private investigators, etc.) We define training activities on different levels for increasing the exchange of information about new trends and criminal modus operandi a",

    "translated_abstract": "每天推广和部署用于打击网络犯罪活动的新技术工具。然而，这些工具往往过于复杂，难以使用，需要深入的领域知识和技术知识。这些特点往往限制了执法人员和最终用户参与这些技术，尽管它们具有潜力，但仍然被误解。出于这个原因，在这项研究中，我们描述了结合学习和培训方法以及利用游戏化提升技术转移和增加成年人学习的潜在好处的经验。事实上，在这种情况下，参与者是暴露于恐怖融资（如执法人员、金融调查员、私人侦探等）的行业的经验丰富的从业人员。我们定义了不同级别的培训活动，以增加关于新趋势和犯罪作案方式的信息交流。",
