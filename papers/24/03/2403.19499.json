Most PerFL methods require extra learning processes on a client to adapt a globally shared model to the client-specific personalized model using its own local data. However, the model adaptation process in PerFL is still an open challenge in the stage of model deployment and test time. This work tackles the challenge by proposing a novel federated learning framework to learn only one robust global model to achieve competitive performance to those personalized models on unseen/test clients in the FL system. Specifically, we design a new Client-Supervised Federated Learning (FedCS) to unravel clients' bias on instances' latent representations so that the global model can learn both client-specific and client-agnostic knowledge.

    "translated_abstract": "个性化联邦学习（PerFL）是一种新的机器学习范式，它在联邦学习环境下为不同客户交付个性化模型。大多数PerFL方法需要在客户端上进行额外的学习过程，以使用其自己的本地数据调整全球共享模型以适应客户特定的个性化模型。然而，在PerFL中的模型适应过程在模型部署和测试时间仍然是一个挑战。本工作通过提出一种新颖的联邦学习框架来解决这一挑战，学习只一个强大全球模型，以在FL系统中实现与那些个性化模型在未知/测试客户上具有竞争性能力。具体来说，我们设计了一种新的客户监督联邦学习（FedCS）来揭示客户对实例潜在表示的偏见，以便全球模型可以学习客户特定和客户不可知的知识。实验研究表明，FedCS可以学习",
