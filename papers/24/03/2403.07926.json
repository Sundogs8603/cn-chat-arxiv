We expand the application of deep learning to value prediction of time-series of spatiotemporal gait data.

    "translated_abstract": "人类步态通常用于诊断和评估医学状况，并在治疗和康复过程中监测进展。利用捕获压力或运动的可穿戴传感器，分析步态数据以帮助恢复、识别活动或识别个体的技术已经出现。深度学习通常采用分类，在计算机视觉、生物医学成像分析以及自然语言处理等各种应用中取得了成功。我们将深度学习应用拓展到时空步态数据的数值预测。此外，我们探索了几种深度学习架构（循环神经网络（RNN）和RNN与卷积神经网络（CNN）相结合），使用两种不同的实验设置进行近程和远程预测。我们的结果显示，近程预测的均方根误差（RMSE）可以低至0。",
