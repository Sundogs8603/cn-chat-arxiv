To overcome this challenge, we propose a Distinctive Dual-Domain Teacher (D3T) framework that employs distinct training paradigms for each domain.

    "translated_abstract": "针对目标检测的领域自适应通常涉及将知识从一个可见领域转移到另一个可见领域。然而，从可见到热红外领域的适应研究有限，因为可见和热红外领域之间的领域差距远远大于预期，传统的领域自适应无法成功地促进在这种情况下的学习。为了克服这一挑战，我们提出了一个称为Distinctive Dual-Domain Teacher (D3T) 的框架，利用各自领域的独特训练范式。具体来说，我们将源训练集和目标训练集分开构建双教师，并逐步对学生模型进行指数移动平均，以适应各个领域的教师。该框架进一步融入了双教师之间的曲折学习方法，在训练过程中促进了从可见到热红外领域的渐进过渡。我们验证了其卓越性能。",
