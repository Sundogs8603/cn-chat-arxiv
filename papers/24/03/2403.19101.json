    "translated_abstract": "文本到图像模型的出现标志着人工智能生成图像（AGIs）发展历程中的重要里程碑，扩大了它们在设计、娱乐等各个领域的应用。尽管取得了这些突破，但AGIs的质量往往仍然不理想，突显了有效评估方法的必要性。这些方法对于评估图像与其文本描述之间的质量至关重要，并且必须准确反映人类感知。在这个领域取得了实质性进展，创新技术如BLIP和DBCNN做出了重大贡献。然而，最近的研究，包括AGIQA-3K，揭示了当前方法与最先进标准之间的显著差异。这一差距强调了更复杂和准确的评估度量的必要性。因此，我们的目标是开发一个能够为度量提供评分的模型，重点关注参数。",
