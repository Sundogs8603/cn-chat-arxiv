    "translated_abstract": "随着生成文本变得更加普遍，评估此类文本在外部知识来源支持的重要性日益增强。许多评估文本支持的方法依赖于某种将文本分解为其各个子声明并将其与可信参考进行评分的方法。我们研究了各种声明分解方法，尤其是基于LLM的方法，如何影响最近提出的FActScore等评估方法的结果，发现它对所使用的分解方法很敏感。这种敏感性的出现是因为这样的度量指标将总体文本支持归因于生成文本的模型，尽管出错也可能来自于度量的分解步骤。为了衡量分解质量，我们引入了一种适应于FActScore的评估方法，我们称之为DecompScore。然后，我们提出了一种基于LLM的生成分解方法，受到伯特兰德·罗素关于逻辑原子性的理论的启发。",
