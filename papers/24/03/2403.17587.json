    "translated_abstract": "挑战冠军比赛是最简单的竞争形式之一，其中一个（最初选择的）冠军反复受到其他玩家的挑战。如果玩家击败冠军，则该玩家被视为新的（当前的）冠军。每位参赛选手按照固定顺序挑战当前的冠军一次。最后一轮的冠军被视为比赛的获胜者。我们研究了一种情形，即玩家可以被贿赂以降低他们对最初冠军的获胜概率。目标是通过贿赂其他玩家来最大化最初冠军赢得比赛的概率，并且不超过规定的贿赂预算。Mattei等人[《应用逻辑杂志》，2015年]表明该问题可以在伪多项式时间内解决，并且在以玩家数量作为参数的情况下，该问题属于XP。我们表明，当以玩家数量为参数时，该问题是弱NP困难的，并且是W[1]-hard的。",
