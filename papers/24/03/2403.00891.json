    "translated_abstract": "信息提取（IE）旨在从文本中提取复杂结构化信息。已为各种IE任务构建了大量数据集，导致耗时且劳动密集的数据标注。然而，大多数流行方法侧重于训练特定任务的模型，而不是明确对不同IE任务之间的通用知识进行建模。此外，相同短语可能在不同任务中具有不一致的标签，这对使用统一模型进行知识迁移构成了巨大挑战。在本研究中，我们提出了一种基于正则化的信息抽取（IE）的迁移学习方法，通过一个指导图解码器进行。具体而言，我们首先为所有著名IE任务的数据集构建一个指导池，然后提出一个指导图解码器，根据相应的指导将各种复杂结构均匀地解码为图。通过这种方式，与现有数据集共享的通用知识可以更好地用于迁移学习。",
