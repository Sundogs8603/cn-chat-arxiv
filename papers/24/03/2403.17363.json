    "translated_abstract": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) 技术在将口语转录为文本方面起着基础性作用，在临床领域具有相当多的应用，包括简化医学转录和与电子健康记录（EHR）系统集成。然而，挑战仍然存在，特别是当转录包含噪声时，导致自然语言处理（NLP）模型应用时性能大幅下降。命名实体识别（NER）是一项重要的临床任务，特别受到此类噪声的影响，通常称为ASR-NLP鸿沟。以前的研究主要研究了 ASR 在干净录音中的效率，留下了关于在嘈杂环境中性能的研究空白。本文引入了一个新颖的数据集 BioASR-NER，旨在填补生物医学领域中的 ASR-NLP 鸿沟，着重于从 Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Tel 中提取不良药物反应和实体提及。",
