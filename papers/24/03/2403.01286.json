In such scenarios, the Robotdog has to autonomously decide whether it is safe to cross the intersection or not in order to further guide the human. We leverage data sharing and collaboration between the Robotdog and other autonomous systems operating in the same environment. We propose a system architecture for autonomous systems through a separation of a collaborative decision layer, to enable collective decision making processes, where data about the environment, relevant to the Robotdog decision, together with evidences for trustworthiness about other systems and the environment are shared.",

    "translated_abstract": "这是一篇关于专门引导视障者在复杂环境中如智能十字路口的机器狗用例的摘要论文。在这种情况下，机器狗必须自主决定是否安全穿过十字路口，以便进一步指导人类。我们利用数据共享和协作，使机器狗与同一环境中其他自主系统之间发生互动。我们提出了一个自主系统的系统架构，通过一个协作决策层的分离来实现集体决策过程，从而分享环境数据、与机器狗决策相关的其他系统和环境的可信度证据。",
