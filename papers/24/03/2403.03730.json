While humans develop the ability of perceiving objects situated in 3D environments without supervision, models that learn the same set of abilities with similar constraints faced by human infants are lacking. Towards this end, we developed a novel network architecture that simultaneously learns to 1) segment objects from discrete images, 2) infer their 3D locations, and 3) perceive depth, all while using only information directly available to the brain as training data, namely: sequences of images and self-motion. The core idea is treating objects as latent causes of visual input which the brain uses to make efficient predictions of future scenes. This results in object representations being learned as an essential byproduct of learning to predict.",

    "translated_abstract": "作为人类核心知识的一部分，对象的表示是支持高层概念和符号推理的心理表示的基本构件。尽管人类能够在3D环境中无需监督地感知对象，但缺乏能够以类似于人类婴儿面临的相似约束条件学习相同能力的模型。为此，我们开发了一种新颖的网络架构，同时学习以下能力：1) 从离散图像中分割对象，2) 推断它们的3D位置，以及3) 感知深度，而仅使用了直接可用于大脑训练数据，即图像序列和自我运动。核心思想是将对象视为视觉输入的潜在原因，大脑利用这些原因做出对未来场景的有效预测。这导致对象表示作为学习预测的基本副产品被学习。",
