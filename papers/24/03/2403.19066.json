    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.19066v1 公告类型：交叉 摘要：单光子相机的惊人发展为科学和工业成像创造了前所未有的机会。然而，这些1位传感器产生的高数据吞吐量对低功耗应用来说构成了重大瓶颈。在本文中，我们探讨了从单光子相机的单个二进制帧生成彩色图像的可能性。我们明显发现，由于曝光变化的显着程度，这个问题对标准着色方法特别困难。我们论文的核心创新是一个在神经常微分方程（神经ODE）下定义的曝光合成模型，它允许我们从单个观测中生成一系列曝光。这一创新确保了在二进制图像中颜色化器采用的一致曝光，导致显著增强的着色。我们展示了该方法在单图像和突发着色中的应用。",
