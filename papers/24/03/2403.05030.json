    "translated_abstract": "人工智能系统有时在部署后会展示出有害的意外行为。尽管开发人员进行了大量诊断和调试，这种情况经常发生。由于攻击面非常广泛，从模型中减少风险具有挑战性。耗尽地搜索可能导致模型失败的输入是不可行的。红队和对抗训练（AT）通常用于使人工智能系统更加健壮。然而，它们并不足以避免许多与对抗训练不同的真实世界故障模式。在这项工作中，我们利用潜在对抗训练（LAT）来防御漏洞，而无需生成引发这些漏洞的输入。LAT利用网络实际用于预测的压缩、抽象和结构化概念的潜在表示。我们使用LAT来清除恶意软件并防御针对保留类别的对抗性攻击。我们展示在图像分类、文本分类",
