Our framework stands out for its ability to provide a deeper understanding of gene sets, significantly surpassing GSEA by 40.28% and LLM baselines by 5.38% based on cosine similarity to human annotations. Our analysis further provides insights into future directions of biological processes naming, and implications for bioinformatics and precision medicine.",
