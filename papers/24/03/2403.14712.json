Here, we explore the size of this opportunity, by mapping out the scale of citizen-facing bureaucratic decision-making procedures within UK central government, and measuring their potential for AI-driven automation. We estimate that UK central government conducts approximately one billion citizen-facing transactions per year in the provision of around 400 services, of which approximately 143 million are complex repetitive transactions. We estimate that 84% of these complex transactions are highly automatable, representing a huge potential opportunity: saving even an average of just one minute per complex transaction would save the equivalent of approximately 1,200 person-years of work e",

    "translated_abstract": "目前政府对人工智能潜力在改善公共服务生产力方面充满期待，通过自动化复杂但重复的官僚任务，从而释放熟练员工的时间。本文通过对英国中央政府面向公民的官僚决策流程进行规模化探索，衡量其AI驱动自动化的潜力。我们估计英国中央政府每年进行大约10亿笔面向公众的交易，提供约400种服务，其中大约有1.43亿笔是复杂重复交易。我们估计这些复杂交易中有84%是高度可自动化的，代表着一个巨大的潜在机遇：仅节省一个复杂交易的一分钟平均时间，就相当于节省约1200人年的工作量。",
