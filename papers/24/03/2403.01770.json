    "translated_abstract": "生成AI技术，如ChatGPT、Gemini和MidJourney，近年来取得了显著进展。最近的文献记录了ChatGPT在其强项领域（如英语和Python/SQL编程）对生产力的积极影响，这归功于大量的训练数据集。然而，在ChatGPT的能力还可以进一步增强的领域，对其性能仍有有限的文献。本文旨在填补这一空白。我们进行了一个实验，经济学生被要求使用一种非英语语言（具体来说是泰语）进行写作分析任务，并使用一种较少使用的编程软件包（具体来说是Stata）进行数学和数据分析任务。研究发现，平均而言，参与者在使用ChatGPT方面表现更好，无论是得分还是完成任务所需的时间。然而，详细的调查显示，34%的部分...",
