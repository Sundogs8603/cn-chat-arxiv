Straightness is crucial for fast integration of the learned flow's paths.

    "translated_abstract": "在过去几年中，流匹配方法在生成建模中得到了蓬勃发展。社区追求的一个引人注目的属性是能够学习具有直线轨迹的流，这些轨迹实现了最优输运（OT）置换。直线性对于快速集成学习流的路径至关重要。不幸的是，大多数现有的流直线化方法都基于非平凡的迭代过程，在训练过程中积累误差或利用启发式小批量OT近似。为解决这一问题，我们开发了一种新颖的最优流匹配方法，仅通过一次流匹配步骤即可为二次成本恢复直线OT置换。",
