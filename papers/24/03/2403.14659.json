    "translated_abstract": "随着自然语言处理（NLP）系统越来越多地整合到人类社会生活中，这些技术将需要越来越多地依赖社会智能。尽管存在许多有价值的数据集可以衡量社会智能的孤立维度，但目前尚不存在任何作品来将这些线索结合在一起，形成一个研究者可以快速识别研究空白和未来方向的凝聚子领域。为实现这一目标，我们构建了一个社交AI数据基础设施，其中包括一个全面的社交AI分类系统和一个包含480个NLP数据集的数据库。我们的基础设施使我们能够分析现有的数据集工作，同时评估语言模型在不同社会智能方面的性能。我们的分析表明，它在帮助深入了解当前数据格局并提供对未来数据集发展潜在方向的整体观点方面具有实用性。",
