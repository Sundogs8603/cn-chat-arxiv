    "translated_abstract": "利用深度学习技术与生物光子设置的整合在生物成像领域开辟了新的视野。该领域中的一个引人注目的趋势是有意地破坏某些测量指标，以设计更好的生物成像工具，从成本、速度和形态因素上进行补偿所产生的缺陷，随后通过利用在大量理想、优越或替代数据上训练的深度学习模型来补偿这些缺陷。这种战略性方法因其提升生物光子成像各个方面的潜力而日益受到青睐。采用这种策略的一个主要动机是追求更高的时间分辨率或增加成像速度，这对捕捉精细的动态生物过程至关重要。这种方法还提供了简化硬件要求/复杂性的可能性，从而以成本和/或尺寸上更易接受的方式使得先进的成像标准更具可及性。",
