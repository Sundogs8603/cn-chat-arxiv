    "translated_abstract": "深度学习技术在海洋垃圾问题中已经被探索了大约20年，但大多数研究在过去五年内快速发展。我们提供了对最近28项深度学习在海洋垃圾领域中最新和最重要贡献的深入、最新的总结和分析。通过交叉引用研究论文结果，YOLO系列明显优于所有其他目标检测方法，但许多受尊敬的贡献者明确表示，目前没有现成的用于机器学习的全面水下垃圾数据库。我们使用由我们精心策划和标记的小型数据集，在一个二分类任务上测试了YOLOv5，并发现准确率较低，假阳性率较高，突显了全面数据库的重要性。我们在这项调查中总结了超过40项未来的研究建议。",
    "tldr": "深度学习技术在海洋垃圾领域取得了长足进展，特别是YOLO系列在目标检测方面表现优异，但研究显示当前缺乏全面的水下垃圾数据库，这成为了进一步研究的瓶颈。",
    "en_tdlr": "Significant progress has been made in applying deep learning techniques to marine debris tracking, with the YOLO family outperforming other methods in object detection. However, the lack of a comprehensive underwater debris database poses a challenge for further advancements in the field."
