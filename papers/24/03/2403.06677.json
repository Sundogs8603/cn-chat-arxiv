    "translated_abstract": "在本研究中，我们研究了在黎曼流形上的随机优化，重点关注在欧几里得和黎曼设置中使用的关键方差减少机制。黎曼方差减少方法通常涉及双循环结构，在每个循环的开始计算完整梯度。确定最佳内循环长度在实践中具有挑战性，因为它取决于强凸性或光滑度常数，这些常数通常是未知的或难以估计。受欧几里得方法的启发，我们引入了无环黎曼SVRG（R-LSVRG）和PAGE（R-PAGE）方法。这些方法用每次迭代中的硬币翻转触发的概率梯度计算替换了外循环，确保了更简单的证明、高效的超参数选择和尖锐的收敛保证。将R-PAGE作为非凸黎曼优化的框架，我们展示了它在各种重要设置中的适用性。",
