However, research on detecting pornographic language within human-machine interaction dialogues is an important subject that is rarely studied. To advance in this direction, we introduce CensorChat, a dialogue monitoring dataset aimed at detecting whether the dialogue session contains pornographic content. To this end, we collect real-life human-machine interaction dialogues in the wild and break them down into single utterances and single-turn dialogues, with the last utterance spoken by the chatbot. We propose utilizing knowledge distillation of large language models to annotate the dataset. Specifically, first, the raw dataset is annotated by four open-source large language models, with the majority vote determining the label. Second, we use ChatGPT to update the empty label from the first step",

    "translated_abstract": "人机交互对话中出现的色情内容可能对开放域对话系统的用户造成严重副作用。然而，有关检测人机交互对话中色情语言的研究是一个很少被研究的重要课题。为了在这个方向上取得进展，我们引入了CensorChat，一个旨在检测对话会话是否包含色情内容的对话监测数据集。为此，我们收集了现实生活中的人机交互对话，并将其分解为单个话语和单轮对话，最后一轮由聊天机器人发表。我们提出利用大型语言模型的知识蒸馏来注释数据集。具体来说，首先，原始数据集由四个开源的大型语言模型进行注释，通过多数票确定标签。其次，我们使用ChatGPT更新第一步中的空标签。",
