    "translated_abstract": "Prompt调整已经证明在融合多模态任务的单模基础模型时具有参数效率性。然而，其有限的适应性和表达能力导致性能不佳与其他调整方法相比。本文通过将简单提示解开以自适应地捕获数据集级和实例级特征来解决这个问题。建立在这种解开的基础上，我们引入了Prompt专家的混合（MoPE）技术来增强表达能力。MoPE利用多模态配对先验在每个实例基础上路由最有效的提示。与简单提示相比，我们基于MoPE的条件提示对多模态融合具有更大的表达能力，在训练数据和可训练参数总数上具有更好的扩展性。我们还研究了一个专家路由的正则化项，导致专家的不断发展专长，不同专家专注于不同的特征。",
