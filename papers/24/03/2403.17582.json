    "translated_abstract": "对话树搜索（Väth等，2023年）是一种最近的对话系统控制方法，其中领域专家通过对话树塑造强化学习代理的行为。代理学会有效地浏览这棵树，同时适应不同用户的信息需求，例如领域熟悉度。然而，额外的训练数据需求阻碍了在新领域的部署。为了解决这个问题，我们探索了直接从对话树生成这些数据的方法。我们改进了原始方法，并展示了在合成数据上训练的代理可以实现与在人类数据上训练的模型相当的对话成功率，无论是使用商业大语言模型进行生成，还是使用较小的开源模型，在单个GPU上运行。我们进一步通过收集和测试两个新数据集来展示我们方法的可扩展性：ONBOARD，一个帮助外国居民搬迁的新领域。",
