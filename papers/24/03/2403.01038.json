    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言任务上展现出令人印象深刻的结果，安全研究人员开始在进攻和防御系统中使用它们。在网络安全领域，已经有多个研究致力于利用LLMs专注于攻击的预入侵阶段，例如钓鱼和恶意软件生成。然而，迄今为止还缺乏关于LLM模型是否可以被利用来模拟通常由人类操作的攻击的攻击后阶段，或者是“手动输入”的攻击，以及针对不同攻击技术和环境的综合研究。",
    "tldr": "大型语言模型有望自动化攻击的先前和后续阶段，这可能会将组织性攻击从罕见的专家主导事件转变为频繁的自动化操作，不需要专业知识，并以自动化速度和规模进行执行，这可能从根本上改变全球计算机安全。",
