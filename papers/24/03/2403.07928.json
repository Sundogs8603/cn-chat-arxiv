    "translated_abstract": "在背包问题中，一组不可分割的对象，每个对象具有不同的价值和大小，必须被放入一个固定大小的背包中，以最大化总价值。即使在对价值和大小有完全信息的情况下，背包问题也被认为是一个NP难题。然而，在许多实际情况下，对象的价值是私人信息，这增加了另一个复杂维度。本文通过研究三种实际拍卖作为交易规则的可能候选项，探讨了具有私人信息的背包问题，在这种设置中，背包所有者通过拍卖将空间卖给对象所有者。这三种拍卖分别是歧视价格拍卖、广义第二价格拍卖和统一价格拍卖。通过使用一种贪婪算法来分配对象，我们使用理论、实验室实验和AI增强模拟，分析了这三种拍卖的竞标行为、收入和效率。",
