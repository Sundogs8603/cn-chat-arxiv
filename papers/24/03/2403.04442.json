This setting is inspired by human-AI teamwork, where an AI-assistant helps its human user solve a problem, in this simplest case, collaborative optimization. We formulate the solution as sequential decision-making, where the agent we control models the user as a computationally rational agent with prior knowledge about the function. We show that strategic planning of the queries enables better identification of the global maximum of the function as long as the user avoids excessive exploration. This planning is made possible by using Bayes Adaptive Monte Carlo planning and by endowing the agent with a user model that accounts for conservative belief updates and exploratory sampling of the points to query.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一个合作的贝叶斯优化问题，用于优化两个变量的黑匣子函数，其中两个代理者一起选择在哪些点上查询函数，但每个只控制一个变量。这个设置受到人工智能与人类团队合作的启发，其中人工智能助手帮助其用户解决问题，在这种简单的情况下是协作优化。我们将解决方案构建为顺序决策，其中我们控制的代理把用户模拟为对函数具有先验知识的计算有理代理。我们展示了对查询的战略规划能够更好地识别全局最大值，只要用户避免过度探索。这种规划是通过使用贝叶斯自适应蒙特卡洛规划以及赋予代理具有考虑保守信念更新和探索性采样的用户模型而实现的。",
