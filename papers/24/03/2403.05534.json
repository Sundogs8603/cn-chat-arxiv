Recently, language models (LMs) have been used to gather information about the preferences of human users. This preference data can be used to fine-tune or guide other LMs and/or AI systems. However, LMs have been shown to struggle with crucial aspects of preference learning: quantifying uncertainty, modeling human mental states, and asking informative questions. These challenges have been addressed in other areas of machine learning, such as Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED), which focus on designing informative queries within a well-defined feature space.

    "translated_abstract": "将人工智能系统与用户兴趣对齐需要理解并融入人类复杂的价值观和偏好。最近，语言模型（LMs）已被用于收集关于人类用户偏好的信息。可以利用这些偏好数据来微调或指导其他LM和/或人工智能系统。然而，已经发现LM在偏好学习的关键方面存在困难：量化不确定性、建模人类心理状态和提出信息性问题。这些挑战在机器学习的其他领域中得到了解决，比如贝叶斯最优实验设计（BOED），它侧重于在一个明确定义的特征空间内设计信息丰富的查询。但这些方法反过来很难扩展并应用于在哪里仅仅识别相关特征都可能很困难的现实问题。我们引入OPEN（Optimal Preference Elicitation with Natural language），这是一个使用BOED来引导",
