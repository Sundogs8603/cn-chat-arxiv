In this paper, (1) we introduce SimuCourt, a judicial benchmark that encompasses 420 judgment documents from real-world, spanning the three most common types of judicial cases, and a novel task Judicial Decision-Making to evaluate the judicial analysis and decision-making power of agents. To support this task, we construct a large-scale judicial knowledge base, JudicialKB, with multiple legal knowledge. (2) we propose a novel multi-agent framework, AgentsCourt",

    "translated_abstract": "随着深度学习、自然语言处理技术的发展，有效提高了传统司法行业各个方面的效率。然而，目前大多数工作主要集中在个别司法阶段，忽视了跨阶段的协作。随着由大型语言模型提供支持的自主代理在现实环境中变得越来越智能，并能做出复杂决策，为司法智能提供了新的见解。本文介绍了SimuCourt，一个司法基准，包括来自真实世界的420份判决文件，涵盖了三种最常见类型的司法案例，以及一个新颖任务司法决策，用于评估代理的司法分析和决策能力。为了支持这一任务，我们构建了一个大规模司法知识库，JudicialKB，其中包含多种法律知识。我们提出了一种新颖的多代理框架，AgentsCourt",
