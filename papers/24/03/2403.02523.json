We first describe the dataset construction for two prototypical situations: a mean reverting synthetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on one hand and real S&P500 data on the other hand.

    "translated_abstract": "变压器模型已被广泛应用于许多机器学习领域，包括大型语言模型和图像生成等，本文探讨了将这种方法应用于金融时间序列的可能性。我们首先介绍了两种典型情况下的数据集构造：一种是均值回归的合成Ornstein-Uhlenbeck过程，另一种是真实的S&P500数据。然后，我们详细介绍了提出的Transformer架构，最后讨论了一些令人鼓舞的结果。对于合成数据，我们能够相当准确地预测下一步的走势，而对于S&P500，我们得到了一些与二次变动和波动率预测相关的有趣结果。",
