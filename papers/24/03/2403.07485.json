    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种基于代理的黑盒优化方法，称为多项式模型优化（PMBO）。该算法通过多项式逼近和贝叶斯优化步骤交替进行，使用高斯过程来模拟目标与其多项式拟合之间的误差。我们描述了PMBO的算法设计，并将PMBO的性能结果与几种优化方法在一组解析测试函数上的表现进行了比较。结果表明，PMBO优于经典的贝叶斯优化，并且对于相关函数族和超参数设置的选择具有鲁棒性，而这在经典的贝叶斯优化中需要仔细调整。值得注意的是，PMBO的性能与协方差矩阵适应 - 进化策略（CMA-ES）等最先进的进化算法相当。这一发现表明，PMBO成为代理方法中的重要选择。",
