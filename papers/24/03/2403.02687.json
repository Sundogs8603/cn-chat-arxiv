It also introduces the separation of the DareFightingICE Competition into two standalone competitions called DareFightingICE Sound Design Competition and DareFightingICE AI Competition--at the 2024 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG)--in which a new platform will be used. This new platform is an enhanced version of the old DareFightingICE platform, having a better audio system to convey 3D sound and a better way to send audio data to AI agents. With this enhancement and by utilizing Unity, the new DareFightingICE platform is more accessible in terms of adding new features for VIPs and future audio research. This paper also improves the evaluation method for evaluating sound designs in the Sound Design Competition which will ensure a better sound design for VIPs as this competit",
