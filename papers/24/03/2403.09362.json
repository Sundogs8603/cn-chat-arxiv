    "translated_abstract": "最近在大型语言模型（LLMs）方面取得的突破主要集中在具有易于获取和充足资源的语言上，例如英语。然而，对于在公共领域缺乏足够语言资源的语言仍存在重大差距。我们的工作引入了Komodo-7B，一个70亿参数的大型语言模型，旨在通过在印度尼西亚、英语和印度尼西亚的11种地区语言之间无缝操作来填补这一差距。Komodo-7B是一组LLMs，由Komodo-7B-Base和Komodo-7B-Instruct组成。Komodo-7B-Instruct凭借在各种任务和语言上取得的最先进性能脱颖而出，超越了OpenAI的GPT-3.5、Cohere的Aya-101、Llama-2-Chat-13B、Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1、Gemma-7B-it等模型制定的基准。这个模型不仅在语言特定和整体评估中表现出优越性能，还突显了其在相关任务中表现出色的能力。",
