Our research uses both conventional and language model-derived features from texts and incident reports, and their combinations to perform severity classification.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究评估了大型语言模型对提升交通事件管理的机器学习过程的影响。它考察了现代语言模型生成的特征在使用事故报告对事件严重性进行分类时如何改善或与预测准确性相匹配。在语言模型和机器学习算法（包括梯度提升决策树、随机森林和极限梯度提升）组合之间进行了多次比较。我们的研究使用了文本和事件报告中传统特征和语言模型生成特征，以及它们的组合进行严重性分类。将语言模型的特征与直接从事件报告中获取的特征结合起来，已经显示出在将事件的严重级别指派给事件时，尤其是在使用随机森林和Ex时，能够提高或至少匹配机器学习技术的性能。",
