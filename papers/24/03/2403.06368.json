The underlying idea is that any sudden shift in self-assessed health immediately following retirement is more likely attributable to the bias. Our strategy is facilitated by a unique high-frequency data that offers monthly, in contrast to the typical biennial, information on employment, self-assessed health, and objective health conditions.

    "translated_abstract": "Justification bias，即退休者可能会报告健康状况下降以合理化其退休，对于退休研究中广泛使用的自评健康测量提出了重大关注。本文介绍了一种新颖的方法来测试这种偏见的存在，类似于回归不连续性的精神。基本思想是，在退休后立即出现的自我评估健康的突然变化更可能是由偏见引起的。我们的策略得益于提供每月信息的独特高频数据，相比之下，这些数据提供比典型的两年一次更频繁的就业、自我评估健康和客观健康状况的信息。在更广泛的退休后时间范围内，我们观察到自我评估的健康状况下降，可能源于证明偏见和实际健康状况的变化。然而，这种不利影响在时间间隔较短时减小，表明没有这种偏见的证据。我们的方法还验证了...",
