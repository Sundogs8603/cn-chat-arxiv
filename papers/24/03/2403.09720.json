In this article, we explore the potential of fine-tuning and prompt tuning in this downstream task, using the Human Value Detection 2023. Additionally, we attempt to validate whether models can effectively solve the problem based on the knowledge acquired during the pre-training stage. Simultaneously, our interest lies in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) aligned with RLHF in this task, and some preliminary attempts are presented.",
