This work explores the (semi-)automatic construction of KGs facilitated by open-source LLMs. Our pipeline involves formulating competency questions (CQs), developing an ontology (TBox) based on these CQs, constructing KGs using the developed ontology, and evaluating the resultant KG with minimal to no involvement of human experts.

    "translated_abstract": "建立本体论和知识图的传统过程严重依赖于人类领域专家来定义实体和关系类型，建立层次结构，保持与领域的关联性，填充ABox（或用实例填充），并确保数据质量（包括准确性和完整性）。另一方面，大型语言模型（LLMs）最近因其理解和生成类似人类自然语言的能力而备受推崇，为自动化该过程的方面提供了有希望的途径。本工作探讨了利用开源LLMs（半）自动构建知识图的方法。我们的流程涉及制定能力问题（CQs），基于这些CQs开发本体论（TBox），使用开发的本体论构建知识图，并在几乎不涉及人类专家的情况下评估生成的知识图。我们通过创建实例展示了半自动化流程的可行性。",
