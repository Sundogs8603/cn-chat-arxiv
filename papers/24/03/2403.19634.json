This paper describes the contributions of our laboratory to the speaker recognition field. These contributions highlight two other challenges in addition to short-duration and language: the mismatch between enrollment and test data and the one between subsets of the evaluation trial dataset. The proposed approaches experimentally show their relevance and efficiency on the SdSv evaluation, and could be of interest in many real-life applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "SdSv挑战任务2为评估现代文本无关说话人验证系统的效率和鲁棒性提供了机会。但它也使得测试能够考虑到该挑战的主要问题（持续时间、语言等）的新方法成为可能。本文描述了我们实验室对说话人识别领域的贡献。这些贡献强调了除了短持续时间和语言之外的另外两个挑战：注册和测试数据之间的不匹配以及评估试验数据集子集之间的不匹配。所提出的方法在SdSv评估中实验性地展示了它们的相关性和效率，并且可能在许多现实应用中具有吸引力。",
