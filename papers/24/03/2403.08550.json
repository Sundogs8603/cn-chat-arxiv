    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种用于从神经型和病理性胎儿大脑的磁共振图像（MRI）生成时空图谱的条件隐式神经图谱（CINA），完全独立于仿射或非刚性配准。在训练过程中，CINA学习了胎儿大脑的一般表示，并将特定于主体的信息编码到潜在代码中。训练后，CINA可以为任何孕龄（GA）和训练领域内涵盖的解剖变化构建忠实的胎儿大脑图谱的组织概率图。因此，CINA能够表示神经型和病理性大脑。此外，经过训练的CINA模型可以通过测试时优化潜在代码来适应未知主体的大脑MRI。然后，CINA可以生成针对特定主体的概率组织图。我们在来自t的总共198例正常和异常胎儿大脑的T2加权MRI上评估了我们的方法。",
