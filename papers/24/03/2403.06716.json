To address this gap, we present a Bayesian network-based method called ERIMap that is tailored to the complex information-scape during emergencies.

    "translated_abstract": "在紧急情况下，高风险决策通常需要在时间紧迫和压力下做出。为了支持这样的决策，需要快速收集和处理来自各种信息源的信息。可用信息往往在时间和空间上变化，不确定，并且有时存在冲突，这可能导致决策中的潜在偏见。目前，缺乏系统化的信息处理和情况评估方法，以满足紧急情况的特殊需求。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了一种名为ERIMap的基于贝叶斯网络的方法，该方法针对紧急情况中复杂的信息环境进行了定制。该方法能够系统地快速处理异构且可能不确定的观测，并对紧急情况的关键变量进行推理。从而降低了决策者的复杂性和认知负荷。",
