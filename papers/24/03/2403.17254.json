    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.17254v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) aims to identify terms or multiword expressions (MWEs) on which sentiments are expressed and the sentiment polarities associated with them. The development of supervised models has been at the forefront of research in this area. However, training these models requires the availability of manually annotated datasets which is both expensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, the available annotated datasets are tailored to a specific domain, language, and text type. In this work, we address this notable challenge in current state-of-the-art ABSA research. We propose a hybrid approach for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis using transfer learning. The approach focuses on generating weakly-supervised annotations by exploiting the strengths of both large language models (LLM) and traditional syntactic dependencies. We utilise syntactic dependency structures of sentences to complement the annotations generated",

    "translated_abstract": "Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)旨在识别表达情感的术语或多词表达(MWEs)以及与之相关的情感极性。在这一领域的研究中，监督模型的发展一直处于研究前沿。然而，训练这些模型需要手动注释的数据集，这既昂贵又耗时。此外，现有的带标记数据集针对特定领域、语言和文本类型。在这项工作中，我们解决了当前最先进的ABSA研究中的这一显著挑战。我们提出了一种使用迁移学习进行基于方面的情感分析的混合方法。该方法旨在利用大型语言模型（LLM）和传统句法依赖的优势生成弱监督标注。我们利用句子的句法依赖结构来补充生成的标注。",
