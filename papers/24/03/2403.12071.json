This study introduces a GenAI tool, based on advanced natural language processing, designed as a digital assistant for educators, enabling the creation of customized lesson plans. The tool utilizes an innovative feature termed 'interactive mega-prompt,' a comprehensive query system that allows educators to input detailed classroom specifics such as student demographics, learning objectives, and preferred teaching styles. This input is then processed by the GenAI to generate tailored lesson plans. To evaluate the tool's effectiveness, a comprehensive methodology incorporating both quantitative (i.e., % of time savings) and qualitative (i.e., user satisfaction) criteria was implemented, spanning various subjects and educational levels, with continuous fee",

    "translated_abstract": "在教育方面，生成式人工智能（GenAI）的出现为传统教学方法带来了革命性的变革，通常忽视个别学生的多样化需求。本研究介绍了一种基于先进自然语言处理的GenAI工具，设计为教育工作者的数字助手，可以帮助制定定制化的课程计划。该工具采用了一项名为“交互式超级提示”的创新功能，这是一个全面的查询系统，允许教育工作者输入详细的课堂特定信息，如学生人口统计信息、学习目标和偏好的教学风格。然后，GenAI通过处理这些输入来生成定制的课程计划。为了评估该工具的有效性，实施了一种全面的方法，既包括定量（即节省的时间百分比）又包括定性（即用户满意度）标准，涵盖了各种学科和教育水平，并持续收费。",
