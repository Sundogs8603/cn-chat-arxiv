    "translated_abstract": "在医疗领域进行流程挖掘时面临着一系列挑战，因为医疗过程中涉及的数据类型各异。通过从医疗过程中收集的各种数据，我们发现存在高度多样性：由索赔数据提供的运营过程，手术期间发生的事件集合，与术前和术后护理相关的数据，以及基于定期门诊访问的高级数据收集，其中并没有明显的事件。本案例研究分析了来自最后一类的数据集。我们将稀疏的心力衰竭患者数据应用流程挖掘技术，并探讨是否可以实现对多个研究问题的信息增益。在这里，可用数据被转换成事件日志格式，并应用流程发现和符合性检查。此外，根据合并症，如糖尿病和慢性肾病，患者被分成不同的队列，并对多个实验进行分析。",
