    "translated_abstract": "智能电网领域需要增强现有能源管理系统的能力；联邦学习（FL）与此目标一致，因为它展示了在异构数据集上训练模型的显着能力，同时保持数据隐私，使其适用于智能电网应用，这些应用往往涉及不同的数据分布和特征之间的相互依赖，这些因素阻碍了线性模型的适用性。本文介绍了将FL与Trust Region Policy Optimization (FL TRPO)相结合的框架，旨在降低能源相关排放和成本。我们的方法揭示了潜在的相互关系，并采用个性化的编码方法来捕捉独特的见解，从而理解特征之间的关系和最佳策略，使我们的模型能够泛化到以前未见的数据。实验结果验证了我们方法的稳健性，证实了其在有效学习方面的高效能力。",
