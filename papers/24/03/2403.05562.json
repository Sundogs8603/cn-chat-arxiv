    "translated_abstract": "一种革命性的心理健康疗法方法融合了文化遗产和先进技术的交汇点。本文介绍了一种创新方法，将机器学习技术与传统的阿拉伯联合酋长国图案相融合，重点放在阿联酋。我们利用了增强了Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)的Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)模型，以创造具有文化意义的上色模板，其中包括Al-Sadu编织图案。这种新颖方法利用了上色疗法被认可的减压益处，并嵌入了深厚的文化共鸣，使其成为治疗干预和文化保护的强大工具。针对广泛性焦虑障碍 (GAD)，我们的方法展示了在减少相关症状方面的重要潜力。此外，本文深入探讨了色彩和音乐疗法的更广泛影响，并强调了文化定制内容的重要性。",
