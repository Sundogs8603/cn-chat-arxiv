In this paper we consider a charger-assisted drone application: a drone is deployed to observe a set points of interest, while a charger can move to recharge the drone's battery. We focus on the route and charging schedule of the drone and the mobile charger, to obtain high observation utility with the shortest possible time, while ensuring the drone remains operational during task execution. Essentially, this proposed drone-charger scheduling problem is a multi-stage decision-making process, in which the drone and the mobile charger act as two agents who cooperate to finish a task. The discrete-continuous hybrid action space of the two agents poses a significant challenge in our problem. To address this issue, we present a hybrid-action d",
