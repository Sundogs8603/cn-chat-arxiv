A naive approach to support the different input and output sizes is to use multiple AE models, which is impractical for the UE due to the limited HW resources. In this paper, we propose a universal AE framework that can support different input sizes and multiple compression ratios.

    "translated_abstract": "现有基于自编码器（AE）的信道状态信息（CSI）框架专注于特定配置的用户设备（UE）和基站（BS），因此AE的输入和输出大小是固定的。然而，在实际情况下，输入和输出大小可能会根据BS和UE的天线数量以及在频率维度上分配的资源块数量而变化。支持不同输入和输出大小的一种简单方法是使用多个AE模型，但由于UE的有限硬件资源，这种方法是不切实际的。在本文中，我们提出了一个通用AE框架，可以支持不同的输入大小和多种压缩比。所提出的AE框架在提供与朴素和最先进方法相比可比的压缩比-失真平衡性能的同时大大降低了硬件复杂度。",
