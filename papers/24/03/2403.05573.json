    "translated_abstract": "儿童福利部门的工作人员使用建立在风险评估（RA）数据上的预测性决策算法来指导和支持儿童福利决策。研究人员指出，RA可能包含偏见信号，会削弱儿童福利案例的复杂性，并且这些算法可能受益于纳入上下文丰富的案例描述，即由工作人员撰写的案例笔记。为了调查这种假设的改进，我们定量地解构了美国一个儿童福利机构两种常用的RA。我们训练了分类器模型，比较了带有和不带有案例笔记描述的RA的预测有效性，并对案例笔记进行计算机文本分析以突出其中揭示的主题。我们的研究发现，用于评估家庭并构建CWS预测性风险模型（PRMs）的常见风险指标无法预测未与出生父母团聚的儿童的出院结果。",
