The majority of the research on video activity recognition is focused on the development of large parameter systems that require training on large video datasets. This paper develops a low-parameter, modular system with rapid inferencing capabilities that can be trained entirely on limited datasets without requiring transfer learning from large-parameter systems. The system can accurately detect and associate specific activities with the students who perform the activities in real-life classroom videos. Additionally, the paper develops an interactive web-based application to visualize human activity maps over long real-life classroom videos.",

    "translated_abstract": "视频活动检测的研究主要集中在识别短视频片段中明确定义的人类活动。视频活动识别的大部分研究都集中在开发需要在大型视频数据集上训练的大参数系统上。本文开发了一个低参数、模块化系统，具有快速推理能力，可以完全在有限数据集上进行训练，而无需从大参数系统中进行迁移学习。该系统可以准确检测和将特定活动与在现实教室视频中执行活动的学生关联起来。此外，本文开发了一个交互式基于Web的应用程序，用于在长时间的现实教室视频上可视化人类活动地图。",
