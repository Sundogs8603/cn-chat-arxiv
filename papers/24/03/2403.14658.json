We begin by understanding Sylvia Wynter's definition of the biocentric Man genre and its exclusion of Blackness from humanness.

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们希望确定典型或标准人工智能开发过程如何鼓励或促成种族化技术的创建。我们首先要理解西尔维娅·温特（Sylvia Wynter）对生物中心人类类型及其将黑人排除在人类之外的定义。然后我们概述了我们认为用于开发基于人工智能的技术的典型步骤，将其分为6个阶段：确定问题、开发过程和管理工具选择、数据集开发和数据处理、模型开发、部署和风险评估、以及集成和监控。本文的目标是更好地理解温特的生物中心人是如何被我们在人工智能生命周期中生产的技术及生命周期本身所代表和强化的；我们希望确定通过区分黑人与“理想”人类导致永续性的方式。",
