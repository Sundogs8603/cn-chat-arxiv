These G3Ms are characterized by the following rule: the reserves of the AMM must maintain the same (weighted) geometric mean before and after each trade. This paper investigates the effects of trading fees on liquidity providers' (LP) profitability in a G3M, as well as the adverse selection faced by LPs due to arbitrage activities involving a reference market. Our work expands the model described in previous studies for G3Ms, integrating transaction fees and continuous-time arbitrage into the analysis. Within this context, we analyze G3M dynamics, characterized by stochastic storage processes, and calculate the growth rate of LP wealth. In particular, our results align with and extend the results concerning the constant product market maker, commonly referred to as Uniswap v2.",
