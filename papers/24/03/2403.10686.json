However, exploring various design space parameters can take much time and effort for hardware engineers to meet specific design specifications. This paper proposes a novel framework called AutoHLS, which integrates a deep neural network (DNN) with Bayesian optimization (BO) to accelerate HLS hardware design optimization. Our tool focuses on HLS pragma exploration and operation transformation. It utilizes integrated DNNs to predict synthesizability within a given FPGA resource budget. We also investigate the potential of emerging quantum neural networks (QNNs) instead of classical DNNs for the AutoHLS pipeline. Our experimental results demonstrate up to a 70-fold speedup in exploration time.",

    "translated_abstract": "高级综合（HLS）是一种设计流程，利用现代语言特性和灵活性，如复杂数据结构，继承，模板等，快速原型化硬件设计。然而，探索各种设计空间参数可能需要硬件工程师花费大量时间和精力，以满足特定设计规格。本文提出了一个名为AutoHLS的新颖框架，将深度神经网络（DNN）与贝叶斯优化（BO）集成，加速HLS硬件设计优化。我们的工具专注于HLS pragma探索和操作转换。它利用集成的DNN来预测在给定FPGA资源预算下的综合性。我们还探讨了量子神经网络（QNNs）的潜力，取代AutoHLS流水线中的经典DNNs。我们的实验结果表明，在探索时间上加速了多达70倍。",
