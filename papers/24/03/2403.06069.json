    "translated_abstract": "有条件扩散模型因其在图像恢复任务中的有效性而得到认可，然而，其从高斯噪声开始的迭代去噪过程往往导致推断速度慢。作为一种有希望的替代方案，图像对图像Schrödinger桥（I2SB）从损坏的图像开始初始化生成过程，并集成了有条件扩散模型的训练技术。在本研究中，我们通过引入隐式图像对图像Schrödinger桥（I3SB）扩展了I2SB方法，通过在每一生成步骤中纳入损坏的图像，将其生成过程转换为非马尔可夫过程。这种增强使得I3SB能够在少量生成步骤中生成具有更好纹理恢复的图像。所提出的方法在CT超分辨率和去噪任务上得到验证，并超越了包括有条件去噪扩散概率模型在内的现有方法。",
