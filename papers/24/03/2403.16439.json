    "translated_abstract": "高清晰（HD）地图在现代自动驾驶车辆（AV）系统的发展中发挥着至关重要的作用，尽管伴随着高昂的标注和维护成本。因此，许多最近的研究提出了从传感器数据在线估计HD地图的方法，使AV能够在先前未映射的区域操作。然而，当前的在线地图估计方法是独立开发的，这使得它们难以集成在AV系统中。具体来说，它们不生成不确定性或置信度估计。在这项工作中，我们扩展了多种最先进的在线地图估计方法，以额外估计不确定性，并展示了这如何能够更紧密地将在线地图制图与轨迹预测集成在一起。通过这样做，我们发现将不确定性整合进去可以使训练收敛速度提高高达50％，在真实世界的nuScenes驾驶数据上，预测性能提高高达15％。",
