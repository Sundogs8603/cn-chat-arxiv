    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.13771v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: In this paper, we propose Describe-and-Dissect (DnD), a novel method to describe the roles of hidden neurons in vision networks. DnD utilizes recent advancements in multimodal deep learning to produce complex natural language descriptions, without the need for labeled training data or a predefined set of concepts to choose from. Additionally, DnD is training-free, meaning we don't train any new models and can easily leverage more capable general purpose models in the future. We have conducted extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis to show that DnD outperforms prior work by providing higher quality neuron descriptions. Specifically, our method on average provides the highest quality labels and is more than 2 times as likely to be selected as the best explanation for a neuron than the best baseline.",

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们提出了Describe-and-Dissect（DnD），一种新颖的方法，用于描述视觉网络中隐藏神经元的作用。DnD利用多模态深度学习的最新进展，生成复杂的自然语言描述，无需标记的训练数据或预定义的概念选择。此外，DnD是无需训练的，这意味着我们不训练任何新模型，未来可以轻松利用更强大的通用模型。我们进行了广泛的定性和定量分析，表明DnD通过提供更高质量的神经元描述优于先前的工作。具体而言，我们的方法平均提供最高质量的标签，并且被选为神经元的最佳解释的概率是最佳基线的两倍多。",
