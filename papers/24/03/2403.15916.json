This issue is further exacerbated if the problem considered is temporally dependent. State-of-the-art solutions today mainly follow centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm in order to handle the scalability concerns. In this paper, we propose time-dependent multi-agent transformers which can solve the temporally dependent multi-agent problem efficiently with a centralized approach via the use of transformers that proficiently handle the large input. We highlight the efficacy of this method on two problems and use tools from statistics to verify the probability that the trajectories generated under the policy satisfy the task. The experiments show that our approach has superior performance against the literature baseline algorithms in both cases.",

    "translated_abstract": "多智能体强化学习中的主要挑战之一是随着智能体数量增加，可扩展性变差。如果考虑的问题是时间相关的，则这个问题会进一步恶化。当今最先进的解决方案主要遵循集中式训练与分布式执行的范式，以处理可扩展性问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种可以通过高效处理大输入的变压器来有效解决时间相关多智能体问题的方法。我们强调了该方法在两个问题上的有效性，并使用统计工具验证了在策略下生成的轨迹满足任务的概率。实验结果表明，我们的方法在两种情况下均优于文献基线算法。",
