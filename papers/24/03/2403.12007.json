    "translated_abstract": "数字行为变化干预（DBCI）正在支持新健康行为的发展。评估它们的有效性对于改进它们和理解成功因素至关重要。然而，特别是在受伦理限制的小规模研究中，开发者的全面指导仍然有限。本研究基于CAPABLE项目，旨在定义通过DBCI支持癌症患者提高生活质量的有效参与方式。我们确定了衡量参与度的指标，探讨了患者和临床医生对DBCI的兴趣，并提出了在这种背景下评估DBCI影响的假设。我们的研究结果表明，医生的处方显着增加了患者对移动DBCI的持续参与。此外，尽管每周一次参与DBCI就足以维持福祉，但从外在动机向内在动机的转变可能需要更高水平的参与。",
