    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.16915v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Fine-tuning in information retrieval systems using pre-trained language models (PLM-based IR) requires learning query representations and query-document relations, in addition to downstream task-specific learning. This study introduces coarse-tuning as an intermediate learning stage that bridges pre-training and fine-tuning. By learning query representations and query-document relations in coarse-tuning, we aim to reduce the load of fine-tuning and improve the learning effect of downstream IR tasks. We propose Query-Document Pair Prediction (QDPP) for coarse-tuning, which predicts the appropriateness of query-document pairs. Evaluation experiments show that the proposed method significantly improves MRR and/or nDCG@5 in four ad-hoc document retrieval datasets. Furthermore, the results of the query prediction task suggested that coarse-tuning facilitated learning of query representation and query-document relations.",

    "translated_abstract": "在信息检索系统中，利用预训练语言模型（PLM-based IR）进行微调需要学习查询表示和查询-文档关系，除了下游任务特定的学习。本研究引入了粗调优作为一个中间学习阶段，连接了预训练和微调。通过在粗调优学习查询表示和查询-文档关系，我们旨在减少微调的负担，提高下游IR任务的学习效果。我们提出了用于粗调优的查询-文档对预测（QDPP），其预测查询-文档对的适当性。评估实验显示，所提出的方法显著改善了四个专题文档检索数据集中的MRR和/或nDCG@5。此外，查询预测任务的结果表明，粗调优促进了查询表示和查询-文档关系的学习。",
