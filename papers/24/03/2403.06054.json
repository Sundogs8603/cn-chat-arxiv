    "translated_abstract": "最近，扩散模型作为一种强大的深度生成先验类别已经引起了人们的关注，由于其出色地建模数据分布的能力，在各种图像恢复任务中表现出色。为了解决图像恢复问题，许多现有技术通过将额外的似然梯度步骤纳入到扩散模型的反向采样过程中来实现数据一致性。然而，这些额外的梯度步骤对于实际应用中存在挑战，因为它们造成了巨大的计算开销，从而增加了推理时间。当使用加速的扩散模型采样器时，这些额外的步骤还会导致额外的困难，因为数据一致性步骤的数量受限于反向采样步骤的数量。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的基于扩散的图像恢复求解器，通过将反向过程与数据一致性步骤分离来解决这些问题。我们的方法涉及",
