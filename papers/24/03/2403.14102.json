    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.14102v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has made significant progress in games with imperfect information, but its performance in the card game Doudizhu (Chinese Poker/Fight the Landlord) remains unsatisfactory. Doudizhu is different from conventional games as it involves three players and combines elements of cooperation and confrontation, resulting in a large state and action space. In 2021, a Doudizhu program called DouZero\\cite{zha2021douzero} surpassed previous models without prior knowledge by utilizing traditional Monte Carlo methods and multilayer perceptrons. Building on this work, our study incorporates residual networks into the model, explores different architectural designs, and conducts multi-role testing. Our findings demonstrate that this model significantly improves the winning rate within the same training time. Additionally, we introduce a call scoring system to assist the agent in deciding whether to become a landlord. With these",

    "translated_abstract": "深度强化学习在具有不完全信息的游戏中取得了显著进展，但在卡牌游戏斗地主方面的表现仍然令人不满意。斗地主不同于传统游戏，它涉及三名玩家，结合了合作和对抗的元素，导致状态空间和动作空间较大。2021年，一款名为DouZero的斗地主程序通过利用传统的蒙特卡洛方法和多层感知器，超越了以往没有先验知识的模型。在此基础上，我们的研究将残差网络纳入模型中，探索不同的架构设计，并进行多角色测试。我们的发现表明，该模型在相同的训练时间内显著提高了获胜率。此外，我们引入了一个呼叫得分系统，帮助代理决定是否成为地主。",
