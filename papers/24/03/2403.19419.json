    "translated_abstract": "关于机器学习中的公平性，尤其是与分类问题有关的公平性，引起了极大兴趣。在涉及排名的问题中，如在线广告、推荐系统和人力资源自动化中，仍然需要进行大量公平性方面的工作。两个复杂之处在于：首先，在许多应用程序中可能无法获取受保护属性。其次，排名的公平性存在多个衡量标准，基于单个衡量标准的优化方法可能会产生相对其他衡量标准不公平的排名。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种针对排名后处理的随机化方法，不需要受保护属性的可用性。通过广泛的数值研究，我们展示了我们的方法相对于基线排名的P-公平性和相对于归一化折扣累计增益(NDCG)的效果的稳健性，改进了先前提出的方法。",
