In this paper we explore some unexpected challenges in the representation of race we found in the process of developing an U.S. English Text-to-Speech (TTS) system aimed to sound like an educated, professional, regional accent-free African American woman. The paper starts by presenting the results of focus groups with African American IT professionals where guidelines and challenges for the creation of a representative and appropriate TTS system were discussed and gathered, followed by a discussion about some of the technical difficulties faced by the TTS system developers. We then describe two studies with U.S. English speakers where the participants were not able to attribute the correct race to the African American TTS voice while overwhelmingly correctly recogn",

    "translated_abstract": "用户界面和机器人中的AI代理的表现主要是白人，不仅在面部和皮肤特征上，而且在他们使用的合成声音上也如此。在本文中，我们探讨了在开发一个旨在听起来像受过教育、专业、地区口音真实的非洲裔美国女性的美式英文文本转语音（TTS）系统过程中发现的有关种族表现的一些意想不到的挑战。论文首先介绍了与非洲裔美国IT专业人员进行的焦点小组讨论的结果，在此过程中讨论和收集了用于创建代表性和合适的TTS系统的指导方针和挑战，接着讨论了TTS系统开发人员面临的一些技术困难。然后，我们描述了两项与美式英语使用者进行的研究，参与者无法将非洲裔美国TTS声音正确归因为正确的种族，而他们在认出该声音时几乎全都正确识别。",
