To address this issue, we propose Multi-Passage to Dialogue (MP2D), a data generation framework that automatically creates conversational question-answering datasets with natural topic transitions. By leveraging the relationships between entities in a knowledge graph, MP2D maps the flow of topics within a dialogue, effectively mirroring the dynamics of human conversation. It retrieves relevant passages corresponding to the topics and transforms them into dialogues through the passage-to-dialogue method.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管面向特定话题的对话系统取得了进展，但在对话中有效地管理话题转移仍然是一个持续的挑战，这在很大程度上归因于训练数据集的有限可用性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了Multi-Passage to Dialogue (MP2D)，这是一个数据生成框架，可以自动创建具有自然话题转换的对话问答数据集。通过利用知识图谱中实体之间的关系，MP2D映射对话中话题的流动，有效地模拟人类对话的动态。它检索与话题对应的相关段落，并通过段落到对话的方法将它们转换为对话。通过定量和定性实验，我们展示了MP2D在生成具有自然话题转换的对话方面的有效性。此外，本研究介绍了一个新颖的话题转移对话基准，TS-WikiDialog。利用t",
