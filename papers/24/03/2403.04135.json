    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.04135v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents a method of unsupervised learning of harmonic analysis based on a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). We introduce the chord quality templates, which specify the probability of pitch class emissions given a root note and a chord quality. Other probability distributions that comprise the HSMM are automatically learned via unsupervised learning, which has been a challenge in existing research. The results of the harmonic analysis of the proposed model were evaluated using existing labeled data. While our proposed method has yet to perform as well as existing models that used supervised learning and complex rule design, it has the advantage of not requiring expensive labeled data or rule elaboration. Furthermore, we also show how to recognize the tonic without prior knowledge, based on the transition probabilities of the Markov model.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于隐藏半马尔可夫模型（HSMM）的无监督学习和声分析的方法。我们引入了和弦质量模板，指定了在给定根音和和弦质量的情况下音高类别发射的概率。组成HSMM的其他概率分布是通过无监督学习自动学习的，这在现有研究中是一个挑战。提出模型的和声分析结果是使用现有标记数据进行评估的。虽然我们提出的方法尚未像使用监督学习和复杂规则设计的现有模型表现得那么好，但它具有不需要昂贵标记数据或规则阐述的优点。此外，我们还展示了如何在没有先验知识的情况下，基于马尔可夫模型的转换概率来识别主音。",
