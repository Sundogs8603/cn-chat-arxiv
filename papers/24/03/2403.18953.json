    "translated_abstract": "水库计算（RCs）是强大的用于时间序列预测的机器学习架构。最近，引入了下一代水库计算（NGRCs），相比RCs，它们具有显著的优势，如降低的计算开销和较低的数据要求。然而，NGRCs与RCs存在着自身独特的实际困难，包括对数据中的采样时间和非线性类型的敏感性。在这里，我们介绍了一种用于复杂和混沌动力系统时间序列预测的混合RC-NGRC方法。我们展示了我们的混合方法可以产生准确的短期预测，并在RC和NGRC各自独立时能够捕捉动力系统的长期统计情况。当两个组件的预测能力都受限时，例如对于小的RC和大的采样时间时，混合RC-NGRC方法的优势最为显著。",
