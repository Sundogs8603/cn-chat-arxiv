Poses are compact yet informative and can greatly benefit applications with limited compute budgets. However, poses alone offer an incomplete understanding of actions, as they cannot fully capture objects and environments with which humans interact. To efficiently model hand-object interactions, we propose HandFormer, a novel multimodal transformer. HandFormer combines 3D hand poses at a high temporal resolution for fine-grained motion modeling with sparsely sampled RGB frames for encoding scene semantics. Observing the unique characteristics of hand poses, we temporally factorize hand modeling and represent each joint by its short-term trajectories. This factorized pose representation combined with sparse RGB samples is remarkably efficient and achieves high accuracy. Unimodal HandFormer with only hand poses outperforms existing skeleton-based methods at 5x fewer FLO",

    "translated_abstract": "3D手部姿势是一种未充分探索的动作识别模态。姿势既紧凑又信息丰富，并且可以极大地受益于计算预算有限的应用。然而，单独的姿势不能完全理解人类与之交互的物体和环境。为了有效建模手部物体相互作用，我们提出了HandFormer，一种新颖的多模态Transformer。HandFormer结合了高时间分辨率的3D手部姿势，用于精细运动建模，并使用稀疏采样的RGB帧来编码场景语义。观察手部姿势的独特特征，我们对手部建模进行了时间分解，并通过其短期轨迹表示每个关节点。这种被分解的姿势表示与稀疏的RGB采样相结合，效率非常高，并且达到了很高的准确性。仅有手部姿势的单模HandFormer在5倍更少的FLO下胜过现有基于骨架的方法。",
