    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.09899v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Over the last several years, several well-established and prominent brick-and-mortar retail chains have ceased operations, raising concerns for something that some have referred to as a retail apocalypse. While the demise of brick-and-mortar is far from certain, scholars have attempted to model the likelihood that a retailer is about to fail using different approaches. This paper examines the failures of Bed Bath and Beyond, J.C. Penney, Rite Aid, and Sears Holdings in the United States between 2013 and 2022. A model of retail failure is presented that considers internal and external firm factors using both annual report and macroeconomic data. The findings suggest that certain revenue-based financial ratios and the annual average U.S. inflation rates are statistically significant predictors of failure. Furthermore, the failure model demonstrated that it can provide a nontrivial early warning signal at least the year before failure. The ",

    "translated_abstract": "过去几年，一些知名的实体零售连锁机构相继倒闭，引发了人们对所谓零售末日的担忧。本文考察了美国自2013年至2022年间Bed Bath and Beyond、J.C. Penney、Rite Aid和Sears Holdings的失败案例。通过考虑内部和外部公司因素，利用年度报告和宏观经济数据，提出了一种零售破产模型。研究结果表明，特定的基于收入的财务比率和年均美国通胀率是破产的显著预测因子。此外，破产模型证明可以在至少破产前一年提供一种非平凡的预警信号。",

The proposed failure model demonstrates the capability to provide a nontrivial early warning signal at least a year ahead of the failure."
