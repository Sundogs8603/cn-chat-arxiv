    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.15872v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Move structures have been studied in English for Specific Purposes (ESP) and English for Academic Purposes (EAP) for decades. However, there are few move annotation corpora for Research Article (RA) abstracts. In this paper, we introduce RAAMove, a comprehensive multi-domain corpus dedicated to the annotation of move structures in RA abstracts. The primary objective of RAAMove is to facilitate move analysis and automatic move identification. This paper provides a thorough discussion of the corpus construction process, including the scheme, data collection, annotation guidelines, and annotation procedures. The corpus is constructed through two stages: initially, expert annotators manually annotate high-quality data; subsequently, based on the human-annotated data, a BERT-based model is employed for automatic annotation with the help of experts' modification. The result is a large-scale and high-quality corpus comprising 33,988 annotated i",

    "translated_abstract": "多年来，人们一直在研究英语专门用途（ESP）和学术目的英语（EAP）中的动作结构。然而，关于研究论文（RA）摘要的动作注释语料库却很少。本文介绍了RAAMove，这是一个专门用于注释RA摘要中的动作结构的综合多领域语料库。RAAMove的主要目标是促进动作分析和自动动作识别。本文对语料库构建过程进行了详细讨论，包括方案、数据收集、注释准则和注释程序。语料库分两个阶段构建：首先，专家标注员手动标注高质量数据；随后，基于人工标注数据，利用基于BERT的模型通过专家修改进行自动标注。结果是一个包含33,988个注释的大规模高质量语料库。",
