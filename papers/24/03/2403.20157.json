    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.20157v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Multilingual modelling can improve machine translation for low-resource languages, partly through shared subword representations. This paper studies the role of subword segmentation in cross-lingual transfer. We systematically compare the efficacy of several subword methods in promoting synergy and preventing interference across different linguistic typologies. Our findings show that subword regularisation boosts synergy in multilingual modelling, whereas BPE more effectively facilitates transfer during cross-lingual fine-tuning. Notably, our results suggest that differences in orthographic word boundary conventions (the morphological granularity of written words) may impede cross-lingual transfer more significantly than linguistic unrelatedness. Our study confirms that decisions around subword modelling can be key to optimising the benefits of multilingual modelling.",

    "translated_abstract": "多语种建模可以通过共享子词表示部分改善低资源语言的机器翻译。本文研究了子词分割在跨语言迁移中的作用。我们系统比较了几种子词方法在不同语言类型之间促进协同作用和防止干扰的功效。研究结果表明，子词正则化提高了多语种建模中的协同作用，而BPE在跨语言微调中更有效地促进了迁移。值得注意的是，我们的结果表明，正字法单词边界约定的差异（书面词汇形态的粒度）可能比语言无关性更显著地阻碍跨语言迁移。我们的研究证实，围绕子词建模的决策可能是优化多语种建模效益的关键。",
