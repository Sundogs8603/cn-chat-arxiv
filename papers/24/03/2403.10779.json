    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.10779v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Despite the global mental health crisis, access to screenings, professionals, and treatments remains high. In collaboration with licensed psychotherapists, we propose a Conversational AI Therapist with psychotherapeutic Interventions (CaiTI), a platform that leverages large language models (LLM)s and smart devices to enable better mental health self-care. CaiTI can screen the day-to-day functioning using natural and psychotherapeutic conversations. CaiTI leverages reinforcement learning to provide personalized conversation flow. CaiTI can accurately understand and interpret user responses. When the user needs further attention during the conversation, CaiTI can provide conversational psychotherapeutic interventions, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI). Leveraging the datasets prepared by the licensed psychotherapists, we experiment and microbenchmark various LLMs' performance in tasks along Cai",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管全球存在心理健康危机，但接受筛查、专业人士和治疗的机会仍很高。与持牌心理治疗师合作，我们提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）和智能设备实现更好心理健康自我护理的对话AI治疗师，即CaiTI平台。CaiTI能够使用自然和心理治疗对话来筛查日常功能。CaiTI利用强化学习提供个性化对话流程。CaiTI能够准确理解和解释用户的回应。当用户在对话中需要进一步关注时，CaiTI可以提供对话式心理治疗干预，包括认知行为治疗（CBT）和激励性访谈（MI）。通过利用持牌心理治疗师准备的数据集，我们对各种LLM在Cai沿任务中的性能进行实验和微基准测试。",
