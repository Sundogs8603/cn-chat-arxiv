    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)作为高级规划者在零-shot游戏代理中表现出很大成功。然而，这些代理主要在Minecraft上进行评估，那里的长期规划相对简单。相比之下，在动态机器人环境中测试的代理面临限制，因为环境简单，只有少量物体和互动。为填补文献中的这一空白，我们提出NetPlay，这是用于具有挑战性的roguelike游戏NetHack的第一个LLM动引擎零-shot代理。NetHack由于其多样的物品和怪物、复杂的互动以及死亡的多种方式而被认为是一个特别具有挑战性的环境。NetPlay使用为动态机器人环境而设计的体系结构，经过修改以适应NetHack。与以前的方法类似，它提示LLM从预定义的技能中进行选择，并跟踪过去的互动以增强决策能力。鉴于NetHack的不可预测性，NetPlay检测到重要的游戏事件",
