    "translated_abstract": "确保条件独立性（CI）约束对于公平和可信赖的机器学习模型的发展至关重要。本文介绍了一个名为OTClean的框架，利用最优输运理论在CI约束下进行数据修复。最优输运理论提供了一个严格的框架来衡量概率分布之间的差异，从而确保对数据效用的控制。我们将涉及CI的数据修复问题形式化为一个二次约束线性规划（QCLP），并提出了一种用于解决该问题的交替方法。然而，由于计算最优输运距离（如Wasserstein距离）所涉及的计算成本，这种方法面临可伸缩性问题。为了克服这些可伸缩性挑战，我们将问题重新构建为正则化优化问题，从而使我们能够开发一个受Sinkhorn矩阵缩放算法启发的迭代算法，从而使我们能够进行可伸缩的数据修复。",
