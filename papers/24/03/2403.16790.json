    "translated_abstract": "去噪扩散概率模型（DDPMs）在生成人工智能领域取得了很大成就。尽管它们性能很高，但还有改进的空间，特别是通过利用强加结构完整性的统计属性来提高样本保真度，如各向同性。仅减小加性和预测噪声之间的均方误差并不能强加对预测噪声为各向同性的约束。因此，我们受到动力，利用加性噪声的各向同性作为目标函数的约束来增强DDPMs的保真度。我们的方法简单，并可应用于任何DDPM变体。我们通过在四个合成2D数据集上进行的实验以及无条件图像生成来验证我们的方法。正如结果所示，这种约束的整合改善了2D数据集的保真度指标Precision和Density以及无条件图像生成的指标。",
