    "translated_abstract": "传统的语义通信任务方法依赖于了解信噪比（SNR）来减轻通道噪声。然而，这些方法需要在特定的SNR条件下进行训练，需要大量时间和计算资源。在本文中，我们提出了GeNet，这是一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的语义通信范式，旨在抵抗噪声，从而促进任务导向通信（TOC）。我们提出了一种新颖的方法，首先将输入数据图像转换为图结构。然后利用基于GNN的编码器从源数据中提取语义信息。这些提取的语义信息然后通过通道传输。在接收端，使用基于GNN的解码器从源数据中重建相关的语义信息以用于TOC。通过实验评估，我们展示了GeNet在抗噪声TOC中的有效性。",
