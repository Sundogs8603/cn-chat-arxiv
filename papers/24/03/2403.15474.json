Concretely, we propose a weighting mechanism to refine the widely used IoU measure, allowing it to assign a higher score to a prediction that covers closer points of a ground-truth object from the ego agent's perspective. The proposed EC-IoU measure can be used in typical evaluation processes to select object detectors with higher safety-related performance for downstream tasks. It can also be integrated into common loss functions for model fine-tuning. While geared towards safety, our experiment with the KITTI dataset demonstrates the performance of a model trained on EC-IoU can be better than that of a variant trained on IoU in terms of mean Average Precision as well.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了通过一种新颖的自我中心交并联（EC-IoU）度量来定向安全性物体检测，解决了在自动驾驶等安全关键领域应用最先进的基于学习的感知模型时面临的实际问题。具体来说，我们提出了一种加权机制来优化广泛使用的IoU度量，使其能够根据自我代理人的视角覆盖更近的地面真实对象点的预测分配更高的分数。所提出的EC-IoU度量可以用于典型的评估过程，选择有更高安全性表现的物体检测器用于下游任务。它还可以集成到常见损失函数中进行模型微调。尽管面向安全性，但我们在KITTI数据集上的实验表明，使用EC-IoU训练的模型在均值平均精度方面的性能可能会优于使用IoU训练的变体。",
