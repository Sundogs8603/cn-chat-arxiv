    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.12606v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this contribution, we introduce a novel ensemble method for the re-identification of industrial entities, using images of chipwood pallets and galvanized metal plates as dataset examples. Our algorithms replace commonly used, complex siamese neural networks with an ensemble of simplified, rudimentary models, providing wider applicability, especially in hardware-restricted scenarios. Each ensemble sub-model uses different types of extracted features of the given data as its input, allowing for the creation of effective ensembles in a fraction of the training duration needed for more complex state-of-the-art models. We reach state-of-the-art performance at our task, with a Rank-1 accuracy of over 77% and a Rank-10 accuracy of over 99%, and introduce five distinct feature extraction approaches, and study their combination using different ensemble methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我们介绍了一种新颖的集成方法，用于重识别工业实体，使用芯片木托盘和镀锌金属板的图像作为数据集示例。我们的算法将常用复杂的孪生神经网络替换为一组简化的基本模型，提供更广泛的适用性，特别是在硬件受限的场景下。每个集成子模型使用给定数据的不同类型的提取特征作为其输入，允许在比更复杂的最先进模型需要的训练时间的一小部分内创建有效的集成。我们在任务中达到了最先进的性能，Rank-1准确率超过77%，Rank-10准确率超过99%，并介绍了五种不同的特征提取方法，并使用不同的集成方法研究它们的组合。",
