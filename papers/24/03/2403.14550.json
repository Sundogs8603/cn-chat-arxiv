    "translated_abstract": "通信机器人有望成为有效的人机交互界面，超越文本或图形解释的潜力。它们的一大优势在于可以使用物理和语音表达来对解释添加详细的细微之处。然而，并不清楚机器人如何应用这些表达，特别是如何能够开发一种策略，根据任务和用户在动态交互中自适应地使用这些表达。为了回答这个问题，本文提出了一种名为DynEmph的方法，用于通信机器人决定在哪些地方用物理表达强调XAI生成的解释。它预测了强调某些观点对用户的影响，并旨在最小化预期用户决策与AI建议之间的差异。DynEmph采用一种基于数据驱动的策略来决定在哪里进行强调，解放工程师不再需要手动进行设计。",
