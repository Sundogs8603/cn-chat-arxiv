    "translated_abstract": "应用程序越来越多地利用混合模态数据，并且必须联合搜索矢量数据，如嵌入图像、文本和视频，以及结构化数据，如属性和关键词。针对这种混合搜索环境的提出的方法要么性能不佳，要么支持一组非常受限制的搜索谓词（例如，仅支持小的相等谓词集），使其对许多应用程序来说不切实际。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了ACORN，一种高性能且与谓词无关的混合搜索方法。ACORN基于Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds（HNSW），这是一种最先进的基于图的近似最近邻索引，并且可以通过扩展现有的HNSW库有效实现。ACORN引入了谓词子图遍历的概念，以模拟一种在理论上理想但在实践中不切实际的混合搜索策略。ACORN的谓词无关构造算法旨在实现这种有效果。",
