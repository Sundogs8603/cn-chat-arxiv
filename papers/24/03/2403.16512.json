    "translated_abstract": "在情境学习（ICL）的支持下，大型语言模型（LLMs）可以利用短时的情境信息执行各种任务，这为缩小高资源语言和低资源语言之间的差距提供了重要途径。然而，目前只有少数研究探讨了针对低资源语言的ICL，其中大部分集中在相对高资源的语言，比如法语和西班牙语。在这项工作中，我们对25种低资源语言和7种相对较高资源语言上的ICL及其跨语言变体（X-ICL）进行了广泛研究。我们的研究不仅评估了LLMs在低资源语言中使用ICL的有效性，还发现了情境标签对齐的缺陷，并引入了更有效的替代方法：查询对齐。此外，我们为低资源语言的ICL的各个方面提供了宝贵的见解。我们的研究总结了少样本情境学习的重要性。",
