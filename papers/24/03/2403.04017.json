    "translated_abstract": "自动定理证明器和形式化证明助手是通用的推理系统，理论上能够证明任意困难的定理，从而解决可归约为数学和逻辑推理的任意问题。在实践中，这些系统面临着极大的组合爆炸，因此包含许多启发式方法和选择点，这些方法和选择点极大地影响其性能。这为受过训练的机器学习预测器提供了机会，可以引导这些推理系统的工作。相反，由逻辑上有效证明概念支持的演绎搜索允许在大型推理语料库上训练机器学习系统。这些证明体通常是通过构建正确的，当与更加精确的训练引导相结合时，可以将它们提升为非常庞大的语料库，具有越来越长的推理链，并可能产生新颖的证明思路。在本文中，我们概述了...",
