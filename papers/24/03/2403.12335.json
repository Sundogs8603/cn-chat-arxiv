    "translated_abstract": "缺乏足够高质量的数据经常是高维时空动态系统数据驱动建模中关键挑战。Koopman自编码器（KAEs）利用深度神经网络（DNNs）的表达能力、自编码器的降维能力以及Koopman算子的谱特性，学习具有更简单线性动态的降阶特征空间。然而，KAEs的有效性受限于有限而嘈杂的训练数据集，导致泛化能力较差。为解决这一问题，我们引入了一种称为时间一致Koopman自编码器（tcKAE）的模型，旨在即使在受限且嘈杂的训练数据情况下生成准确的长期预测。这是通过强制在不同时间步上保持预测一致性的一致性正则化项实现的，从而增强了tcKAE相对于现有模型的稳健性和泛化能力。",
