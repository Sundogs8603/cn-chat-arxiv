We developed a clinical image dataset using original and augmented images for five penile diseases: herpes eruption, syphilitic chancres, penile candidiasis, penile cancer, and genital warts. We used a U-net architecture model for semantic pixel segmentation into background or subject image, the Inception-ResNet version 2 neural architecture to classify each pixel as diseased or non-diseased, and a salience map using GradCAM++.
