    "translated_abstract": "这项研究考虑了2014年至2023年英国大学退休金计划（USS）的估值情况。USS是一个价值70-80亿英镑的定义利益养老金计划，拥有超过50万名成员，他们在英国约70所大学工作（或曾经在这些大学工作过）。关于USS的争议导致了长达十年的劳资纠纷。新的结果显示了USS养老金缴纳额对英国政府债券回报（政府债券收益）的高度依赖。对USS特定的“自给自足”（SfS）定义的两个条件进行了研究。呈现了USS数据以及新的分析。研究表明，“维持高资金比例”的第二个SfS条件主导了USS建模，加剧了对政府债券收益的依赖，使SfS债务超出监管要求，导致了过度谨慎。还研究了USS指标“实际”和“目标”依赖的红、黄、绿色状态。结果显示，“目标”依赖度“实际”和“目标”依赖度的红、黄、绿色状态也得到了研究。",
