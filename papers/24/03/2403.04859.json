    "translated_abstract": "随着遥感图像中带有各种大气条件的标记数据的有限可用性，似乎使用自监督算法很有用。包括旋转、空间上下文和拼图在内的几种基于假设的算法并不适用于卫星图像。通常，卫星图像具有更高的时间频率。 因此，遥感数据的时间维度提供了自然增强，而无需我们创建图像的人工增强。 在这里，我们提出了S3-TSS，一种利用时间维度中自然增强的自监督学习技术的新方法。 我们将我们的结果与当前领先的方法进行了比较，并进行了各种实验。 我们观察到，我们的方法在四个下游数据集中表现优于基线SeCo。 我们的工作代码可以在这里找到：https://github.com/hewanshrestha/Why-Self-Supervision-in-Time",
