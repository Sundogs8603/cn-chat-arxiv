The vast amounts of content generated by Persian users on thousands of websites, blogs, and social networks such as Telegram, Instagram, and Twitter present a rich resource of information. Deep learning techniques have become increasingly favored for extracting insights from this extensive pool of raw data, although they face several challenges. In this study, we introduced and implemented a hybrid deep learning-based model for sentiment analysis, using customer review data from the Digikala Online Retailer website. We employed a variety of deep learning networks and regularization techniques as classifiers. Ultimately, our hybrid approach yielded an impressive performance, achieving an F1 score of 78.3 acro",
