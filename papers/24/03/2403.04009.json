Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, politically biased news (PBN) has significantly undermined public trust in vaccines, despite strong medical evidence supporting their efficacy. In this paper, we analyze: (i) how inherent vaccine stances subtly influence individuals' selection of news sources and participation in social media discussions; and (ii) the impact of exposure to PBN on users' attitudes toward vaccines. In doing so, we first curate a comprehensive dataset that connects PBN with related social media discourse. Utilizing advanced deep learning and causal inference techniques, we reveal distinct user behaviors between social media groups with various vaccine stances. Moreover, we observe that individuals with moderate stances, particularly the vaccine-hesitant majority, are more vulnerable to the influence of PBN compared t",

    "translated_abstract": "新闻媒体被利用作为政治工具偏离事实，未经证据支持地提出偏见性观点。在新冠疫情期间，政治偏见新闻（PBN）显著削弱了公众对疫苗的信任，尽管有强有力的医学证据支持其有效性。在本文中，我们分析了：（i）内在疫苗立场如何微妙地影响个人选择新闻来源和参与社交媒体讨论；以及（ii）暴露于PBN对用户对疫苗态度的影响。为此，我们首先整理了一个将PBN与相关社交媒体话语连接起来的全面数据集。利用先进的深度学习和因果推断技术，我们揭示了具有不同疫苗立场的社交媒体群体之间的明显用户行为。此外，我们观察到，具有中立立场的个体，尤其是犹豫接种疫苗的多数派，对PBN的影响更加脆弱，相比之下",
