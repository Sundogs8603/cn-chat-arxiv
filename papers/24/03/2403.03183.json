    "translated_abstract": "基于Transformer的模型展示了显著的上下文学习能力，引发了对其基础机制的广泛研究。最近的研究表明，Transformers可以实现一阶优化算法进行上下文学习，甚至对于线性回归的情况，可以实现二阶优化算法。在这项工作中，我们研究了Transformer是否能够执行高阶优化方法，超越了线性回归的情况。我们确定具有ReLU层的线性注意力Transformer可以近似实现二阶优化算法，用于逻辑回归任务，并且仅使用对数到错误更多的层可以达到$\\epsilon$误差。作为副产品，我们展示了即使是仅具有线性注意力的Transformer也可以在仅两层的情况下实现矩阵求逆的牛顿迭代的单步。这些结果表明了Transformer架构实现的潜力。",
