    "translated_abstract": "在现实世界的应用中，由恶劣天气引起的图像退化总是复杂的，并且随着不同天气条件的变化而变化。现实世界环境中的系统不断遇到以前未曾观察到的恶劣天气条件。因此，恶劣天气去除模型实际上需要不断学习增量收集的反映各种退化类型的数据。现有的恶劣天气去除方法，无论是针对单个还是多个恶劣天气，主要设计为静态学习范式，假设在单一阶段学习过程之前可以精细收集处理所有类型的退化数据。因此，它们无法直接处理增量学习需求。为了解决这个问题，我们最早努力研究了持续全方位恶劣天气去除任务，处于更接近实际的环境设置。",
    "tldr": "该论文研究了如何在统一网络结构上进行持续全方位恶劣天气去除任务，以适应现实世界中不断变化的恶劣天气条件，而非传统静态学习范式。"
