    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了通过代理人进行的竞争机制游戏（CMGPTA），这是GPTA（Prat和Rustichini（2003））的延伸，其中委托人可以提供任意规定了对每个代理人的转移时间表的机制，前提是所有代理人的消息。我们利用离径处的偏差者报告机制（DRMs）和单一的转移时间表来确定均衡分配。我们设计了一个实验室实验来实施DRMs。我们观察到，实施的结果更经常是有效的，而不是随机的。大部分时间，代理人确实会告诉一个偏离的委托人的身份，尽管在虚报上进行（心照不宣的）共谋可能有利可图。随着游戏的进行，代理人学会了如何与他们的对手代理人进行交易，跨组的虚报共谋的平均预测概率从实验开始时的约9%增加到实验结束时几乎达到20%。",
