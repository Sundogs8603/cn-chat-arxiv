However, the eLearning process can give rise to a spatial and temporal gap that poses interesting challenges for assessment of not only content, but also students' acquisition of core skills such as self-regulated learning. Our objective was to discover students' self-regulated learning processes during an eLearning course by using Process Mining Techniques. We applied a new algorithm in the educational domain called Inductive Miner over the interaction traces from 101 university students in a course given over one semester on the Moodle 2.0 platform.

    "translated_abstract": "在最近几十年里，电子学习场景中的内容评估得到了广泛改进。然而，电子学习过程可能导致空间和时间上的差距，这对于不仅内容评估，还关于学生核心技能如自主学习的评估提出了有趣的挑战。本研究旨在利用过程挖掘技术发现电子学习课程中学生的自主调节学习过程。我们在Moodle 2.0平台上的一个学期课程中应用了在教育领域中称为Inductive Miner的新算法对101名大学生的互动迹线进行分析。通过提取自平台事件日志中的21629条迹线数据，发现了有助于改善教学过程的学生自我调节模型。Inductive Miner算法在此数据集中发现了适合通过和未通过学生的最佳模型，以适应两者的适应性。",
