Despite advances in breast cancer treatments, medication non-adherence remains a major problem. As electronic health records do not typically capture patient-reported outcomes that may reveal information about medication-related experiences, social media presents an attractive resource for enhancing our understanding of the patients' treatment experiences. In this paper, we developed natural language processing (NLP) based methodologies to study information posted by an automatically curated breast cancer cohort from social media. We employed a transformer-based classifier to identify breast cancer patients/survivors on X (Twitter) based on their self-reported information, and we collected longitudinal data from their profiles. We then designed a multi-layer rule-based model to develop a breast cancer therapy-associated sid",

    "translated_abstract": "乳腺癌是一个重要的公共卫生问题，也是妇女癌症相关死亡的主要原因。尽管乳腺癌治疗取得了进展，药物不依从仍然是一个主要问题。由于电子健康记录通常不捕捉可能揭示关于药物相关经历的患者报告的结果，社交媒体为增进我们对患者治疗经历的理解提供了有吸引力的资源。本文开发了基于自然语言处理（NLP）的方法来研究社交媒体上自动策划的乳腺癌队列发布的信息。我们使用基于Transformer的分类器识别自我报告信息的乳腺癌患者/幸存者，我们从其个人资料中收集了纵向数据。然后，我们设计了一个多层规则模型来开发与乳腺癌疗法相关的sid",
