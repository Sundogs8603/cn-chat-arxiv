For the first time, we applied a transformer-based attention mechanism to investigate the underlying interactions between combined PULSAR and PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy based on a murine cancer model (Lewis Lung Carcinoma, LLC). The proposed approach is able to predict the trend of tumor volume change semi-quantitatively, and excels in identifying the potential causal relationships through both self-attention and cross-attention scores.",
