    "translated_abstract": "膀胱癌是英国每天造成15人死亡的领先泌尿道癌症。这种癌症主要表现为非肌层侵袭性膀胱癌（NMIBC），其特点是肿瘤还未渗透到膀胱壁的肌肉层。 NMIBC的复发率非常高，达到70-80％，因此治疗成本最高。目前用于预测复发的工具使用评分系统来高估风险，并具有较低的准确性。对复发的不准确和延迟预测显著提高了死亡的可能性。因此，准确预测复发对于成本效益的管理和治疗计划至关重要。这就是机器学习（ML）技术出现的地方，通过利用分子和临床数据预测NMIBC复发，成为一种有前途的方法。本次审查对预测NMIBC复发的ML方法进行了全面分析。我们的系统评估使",
