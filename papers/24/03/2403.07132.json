In this paper, a new annotated dataset composed of 190 images of bulldogs' nostrils is presented. Three degrees of stenosis are approximately equally represented in the dataset: mild, moderate and severe stenosis. The dataset also comprises a small quantity of non stenotic nostril images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first image dataset addressing this problem. Furthermore, deep learning is investigated as an alternative to automatically infer stenosis degree using nostril images. In this work, several neural networks were tested: ResNet50, MobileNetV3, DenseNet201, SwinV2 and MaxViT.

    "translated_abstract": "短头犬品种中的一种外形特征——短颅，引起了BOAS，一种呼吸障碍疾病，影响了狗的健康和福祉，表现为各种症状。本文提出了一个由190张狮子狗鼻孔图像组成的新的注释数据集。数据集中大约均匀代表了三种狭窄程度：轻度、中度和严重狭窄。数据集还包括少量非狭窄鼻孔图像。据我们所知，这是首个解决这一问题的图像数据集。此外，还探讨了使用鼻孔图像自动推断狭窄程度的深度学习作为替代方法。在本研究中，测试了几种神经网络：ResNet50、MobileNetV3、DenseNet201、SwinV2和MaxViT。在这个评估中，问题被建模为两种不同的方式：首先，作为一个三类分类问题（轻度或开放，中度，和严重）；其次，作为一个二分类问题",
