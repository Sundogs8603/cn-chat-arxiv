    "translated_abstract": "预测生存的可能性对于被诊断为癌症的个体来说至关重要，因为它提供了关于早期预后的宝贵信息。这种知识使得制定有效的治疗方案成为可能，从而带来改善患者结局的结果。在过去几年中，深度学习模型为评估医学图像、电子健康记录和基因组数据以估计癌症风险分数提供了可行的解决方案。然而，这些模型通常没有充分发挥其潜力，因为它们很难学习具有回归意识的特征表示。在本研究中，我们提出Survival Rank-N Contrast（SurvRNC）方法，该方法引入了一种损失函数作为正则化器，以根据生存时间获得一个有序表示。该函数可以处理被截尾的数据，并可以被整合到任何生存模型中，以确保所学得的表示是顺序的。",
