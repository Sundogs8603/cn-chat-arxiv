In this paper, we consider not only how to properly represent cell-PDN relation, but also how to model IR drop following its physical nature in the feature aggregation procedure.

    "translated_abstract": "电源供应网络（PDN）上的IR掉电与PDN的配置和电流消耗密切相关。随着集成电路（IC）设计的不断增大，动态IR掉电仿真变得计算成本高昂，基于机器学习的IR掉电预测被探索为一种有前途的解决方案。本文考虑不仅如何正确表示单元-PDN关系，还考虑如何在特征聚合过程中模拟IR掉电遵循其物理特性。因此，我们提出了一种新颖的图结构，PDNGraph，统一了PDN结构和细粒度单元-PDN关系的表示。我们进一步提出了一种双分支异构网络，PDNNet，将两个并行的GNN-CNN分支整合在一起，有利于捕捉上述特征。",
