    "translated_abstract": "策略镜像下降（PMD）作为一种多功能算法框架，包括几种重要的策略梯度算法，如自然策略梯度，并与最先进的强化学习（RL）算法（如TRPO和PPO）相联系。PMD可以看作是实现正则化1步贪心策略改进的软策略迭代算法。然而，1步贪心策略可能不是最佳选择，最近在RL领域取得了显着的实证成功，如AlphaGo和AlphaZero已经证明，相对于多步骤，贪心方法可以超越它们的1步骤对应物。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新类别的PMD算法，称为$h$-PMD，它将具有前瞻深度$h$的多步贪心策略改进结合到PMD更新规则中。为了解决折扣无限时间视角下的马尔可夫决策过程，其中折扣因子为$\\gamma$，我们展示了$h$-PMD可以推广标准的PMD。",
