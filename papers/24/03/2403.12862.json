    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.12862v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper investigates the inherent knowledge in language models from the perspective of epistemological holism. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether LLMs exhibit characteristics consistent with epistemological holism. These characteristics suggest that core knowledge, such as general scientific knowledge, each plays a specific role, serving as the foundation of our knowledge system and being difficult to revise. To assess these traits related to holism, we created a scientific reasoning dataset and examined the epistemology of language models through three tasks: Abduction, Revision, and Argument Generation. In the abduction task, the language models explained situations while avoiding revising the core knowledge. However, in other tasks, the language models were revealed not to distinguish between core and peripheral knowledge, showing an incomplete alignment with holistic knowledge principles.",

    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文从认识论整体主义的角度探讨了语言模型中固有的知识。本文的目的是探讨LLMs是否表现出与认识论整体主义一致的特征。这些特征表明核心知识，如一般科学知识，每个都发挥着特定的作用，作为我们知识系统的基础并难以修改。为了评估与整体主义相关的这些特征，我们创建了一个科学推理数据集，并通过三个任务检验了语言模型的认识论：Abduction，Revision和Argument Generation。在绑架任务中，语言模型解释了情境，同时避免修改核心知识。然而，在其他任务中，语言模型被揭示出无法区分核心和周边知识，显示出与整体知识原则的不完全契合。",
