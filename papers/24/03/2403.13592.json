We expand this line of research beyond the two-party system in the US and audit Llama Chat in the context of EU politics in various settings to analyze the model's political knowledge and its ability to reason in context. We adapt, i.e., further fine-tune, Llama Chat on speeches of individual euro-parties from debates in the European Parliament to reevaluate its political leaning based on the EUandI questionnaire. Llama Chat shows considerable knowledge of national parties' positions and is capable of reasoning in context. The adapted, party-specific, models are substantially re-aligned towards respective positions which we see as a starting point for using chat-based LLMs as data-driven conversational engines to assist research in political science.",

    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.13592v1 类型：新文章 摘要：细化指导的大型语言模型具有明显的政治倾向，已经被证明会影响下游任务的执行。我们将这一研究领域扩展到美国两党制以外，在不同环境中审计 Llama Chat，以分析该模型对欧盟政治的了解程度及其在上下文中推理的能力。我们适应，即进一步细化，Llama Chat 基于欧洲议会辩论中个别欧洲政党的演讲进行适应性调整，以根据EUandI问卷重新评估其政治倾向。Llama Chat 显著了解各国政党的立场，并能够在上下文中推理。经调整的、特定政党的模型在相应立场上有明显的重新调整，我们认为这是将基于对话的LLM作为数据驱动的对话引擎用于协助政治科学研究的起点。",
