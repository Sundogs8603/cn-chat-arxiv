However, the persistent issue of school dropout poses a significant challenge, with its effects extending beyond the individual. While previous research has employed machine learning for dropout classification, these studies often suffer from a short-term focus, relying on data collected only a few years into the study period. This study expanded the modeling horizon by utilizing a 13-year longitudinal dataset, encompassing data from kindergarten to Grade 9. Our methodology incorporated a comprehensive range of parameters, including students' academic and cognitive skills, motivation, behavior, well-being, and officially recorded dropout data. The machine learning models developed in this study demonstrated notable classification ability, achieving a mean area u",

    "translated_abstract": "教育在减轻贫困、推动经济增长和赋予个人权力方面起着至关重要的作用，从而显着影响社会和个人发展。尽管以前的研究采用机器学习进行辍学分类，但这些研究往往受短期焦点的影响，依赖于仅在研究期间收集了几年数据。本研究通过利用一个为期13年的纵向数据集扩展了建模视角，涵盖了从幼儿园到9年级的数据。我们的方法结合了一系列广泛的参数，包括学生的学术和认知能力、动机、行为、幸福感以及官方记录的辍学数据。本研究开发的机器学习模型展现出显著的分类能力，实现了平均面积u",
