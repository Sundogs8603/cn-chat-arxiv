    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.01088v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Over the past 60 years, there has been a gradual increase in the volatility of daily returns for the S&P 500 Index. Hypothetically, suppose that market forces determine daily volatility such that a daily leveraged S&P 500 fund cannot outperform a standard S&P 500 fund in the long run. Then this hypothetical volatility happens to support the increase in volatility seen in the S&P 500 index. On this basis, it appears that the classic argument of the market portfolio being unbeatable in the long run is determining the volatility of S&P 500 daily returns. Moreover, it follows that the long-term volatility of the daily returns for the S&P 500 Index should continue to increase until passing a particular threshold. If, on the other hand, this hypothesis about market forces increasing volatility is invalid, then there is room for daily leveraged S&P 500 funds to outperform their unleveraged counterparts in the long run.",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去的60年里，标普500指数的日收益波动性逐渐增加。从假设上来看，市场力量决定了每日波动性，因此一只每日加杠杆的标普500基金无法在长期内胜过标准的标普500基金。因此，这种假设性的波动性支持了标普500指数波动性的增加。基于这一点，可以看出，在长期内市场组合无可超越的经典论点正在决定着标普500日收益的波动性。此外，这也意味着标普500指数日收益的长期波动性应该继续增加，直至超过一个特定的阈值。另一方面，如果关于市场力量增加波动性的假设是无效的，那么每日加杠杆的标普500基金有机会在长期内胜过不加杠杆的基金。",
