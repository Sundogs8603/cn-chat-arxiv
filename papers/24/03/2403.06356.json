    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.06356v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Currently, various studies have been exploring generation of long videos. However, the generated frames in these videos often exhibit jitter and noise. Therefore, in order to generate the videos without these noise, we propose a novel framework composed of four modules: separate tuning module, average fusion module, combined tuning module, and inter-frame consistency module. By applying our newly proposed modules subsequently, the consistency of the background and foreground in each video frames is optimized. Besides, the experimental results demonstrate that videos generated by our method exhibit a high quality in comparison of the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "目前，各种研究都在探索生成长视频的方法。然而，这些视频中生成的帧经常出现抖动和噪音。因此，为了生成没有这些噪音的视频，我们提出了一个新颖的框架，由四个模块组成：独立调节模块、平均融合模块、综合调节模块和帧间一致性模块。通过逐步应用我们提出的新模块，优化了每个视频帧中背景和前景的一致性。此外，实验结果表明，通过我们的方法生成的视频在质量上与最先进的方法相比具有高质量。",
