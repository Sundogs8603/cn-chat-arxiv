This poses significant difficulties for LLM-based agents, particularly in domains where pre-trained LLMs lack sufficient knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, called AutoGuide, that bridges the knowledge gap in pre-trained LLMs by leveraging implicit knowledge in offline experiences. Specifically, AutoGuide effectively extracts knowledge embedded in offline data by extracting a set of state-aware guidelines. Importantly, each state-aware guideline is expressed in concise natural language and follows a conditional structure, clearly describing the state where it is applicable. As such, the resulting guidelines enable a principled way to provide helpful knowledge pertinent to an agent's current decision-making process. We show that our approach outperforms competitive LLM-based baselines by a large margin in sequential",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的主要局限性是它们对世界的理解受限。这给基于LLMs的代理带来了重大困难，特别是在预训练的LLMs缺乏足够知识的领域。在本文中，我们介绍了一个名为AutoGuide的新框架，通过利用离线经验中的隐含知识来弥合预训练LLMs中的知识差距。具体而言，AutoGuide通过提取一组状态感知指南有效地提取嵌入在离线数据中的知识。每个状态感知指南以简洁的自然语言表达，并遵循条件结构，清晰描述适用的状态。因此，由此产生的指南为向代理当前的决策过程提供有用的知识提供了一种原则性的方法。我们展示了我们的方法在顺序任务中大幅领先于竞争的基于LLMs的基线。",
