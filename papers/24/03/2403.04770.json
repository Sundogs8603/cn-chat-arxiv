In this paper, we introduce a new data set of dialogue utterances machine-labeled with social orientation tags. We show that social orientation tags improve task performance, especially in low-resource settings, on both English and Chinese language benchmarks.

    "translated_abstract": "许多情境下，预测和解释对话的成功或失败是很有用的。心理学的Circumplex理论建模了会话参与者的社交取向（例如，热情友好、傲慢冷漠）可以用来预测和解释社交互动的结果。我们的工作在于系统性地应用社交取向标签来建模对话结果。在本文中，我们介绍了一个新的对话话语数据集，机器标记了社交取向标签。我们展示社交取向标签提高了任务性能，特别是在英文和中文语言基准中的低资源环境。我们还演示了社交取向标签如何帮助解释神经模型中社交互动的结果。根据显示出社交取向标签在对话结果预测任务中实用性的结果，我们发布我们的数据集",
