    "translated_abstract": "极地海冰覆盖的推移和退缩模式的观测是全球变暖的重要指标。本研究旨在开发一个稳健、有效且可扩展的系统，利用 Sentinel-2（S2）图像对极地海冰进行分类，如厚雪覆盖、年轻薄冰或露水。由于S2卫星在地球表面积极捕捉高分辨率图像，有许多需要分类的图像。一个主要障碍是缺乏标记的S2训练数据（图像）作为基准。我们展示了一种可扩展且准确的方法，利用精心确定的颜色阈值对S2图像进行分割和自动标注。我们使用 PySpark中的并行工作流程，在基于薄云和阴影过滤的基于颜色的分割的基础上，实现了9倍数据加载和16倍 MapReduce 加速，用于自动标注 S2 图像以生成标签数据。",
