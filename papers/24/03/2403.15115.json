We claim that many of the observed shortcomings can be attributed to violation of one or more conversational principles. By drawing upon extensive research from both the social science and AI communities, we propose a set of maxims -- quantity, quality, relevance, manner, benevolence, and transparency -- for describing effective human-AI conversation. We first justify the applicability of the first four maxims (from Grice) in the context of human-AI interactions. We then argue that two new maxims, benevolence (concerning the generation of, and engagement with, harmful content) and transparency (concerning recognition of one's knowledge boundaries, operational constraints, and intents), are necessary for addressing behavior unique to modern human-AI interactions.

    "translated_abstract": "现代语言模型虽然复杂，但在对话环境中存在一些固有缺陷。我们认为观察到的许多缺陷可以归因于违反一个或多个对话原则。通过借鉴社会科学和人工智能领域的广泛研究，我们提出了一组最大化准则 - 包括数量、质量、相关性、方式、仁慈以及透明度 - 来描述有效的人机对话。我们首先证明了在人机互动背景下 Grice 的前四个最大化准则的适用性。然后，我们认为两个新的准则，仁慈（涉及生成和参与有害内容）和透明度（涉及识别自己的知识边界、操作约束和意图），对于解决现代人机互动中独特行为是必要的。提出的准则为如何提供具体指导提供了指导。",
