    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统在当今各种平台上得到广泛实施，根据用户的偏好向他们推荐相关的物品。依赖用户-物品交互矩阵的经典方法存在局限性，特别是在新物品缺乏交互数据的情况下。基于知识图（KG）的推荐系统已经成为一种有前途的解决方案。然而，大多数基于KG的方法采用节点嵌入，这种方法不能为不同用户提供个性化推荐，也无法很好地推广到新物品。为了解决这些局限性，我们提出了基于知识增强的用户中心子图网络（KUCNet），这是一种利用图神经网络（GNN）进行有效推荐的子图学习方法。KUCNet为每个用户-物品对构建一个U-I子图，该子图捕获了用户-物品交互的历史信息和KG中提供的附加信息。基于注意力机制的GNN进入...",
