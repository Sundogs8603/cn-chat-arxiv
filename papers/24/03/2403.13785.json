    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.13785v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: One of the most appreciated features of Fault Trees (FTs) is their simplicity, making them fit into industrial processes. As such processes evolve in time, considering new aspects of large modern systems, modelling techniques based on FTs have adapted to these needs. This paper proposes an extension of FTs to take into account the problem of Predictive Maintenance, one of the challenges of the modern dependability field of study. The paper sketches the Predictive Fault Tree language and proposes some use cases to support their modelling and analysis in concrete industrial settings.",
