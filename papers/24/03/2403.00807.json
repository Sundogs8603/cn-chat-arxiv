    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)是一类利用Transformer网络构建的生成式人工智能模型，能够利用大量数据集识别、总结、翻译、预测和生成语言。LLMs承诺改变社会，然而训练这些基础模型面临巨大挑战。在大型语言模型中进行语义向量搜索是一种强大的技术，可以显著增强搜索结果的准确性和相关性。与传统基于关键词的搜索方法不同，语义搜索利用单词的含义和上下文来理解查询背后的意图，并提供更精确的结果。Elasticsearch是一种最流行的工具之一，用于实现语义搜索，是一个专为索引和搜索大数据集设计的可扩展和稳健的搜索引擎。在本文中，我们深入探讨了语义搜索的基础知识，并探讨了如何利用Elasticsearch和Transformer模型。",
