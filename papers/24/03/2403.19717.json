    "translated_abstract": "移动应用通过将数据处理移至用户的智能手机来支持用户隐私。现在，诸如视觉模型之类的先进机器学习（ML）模型能够在本地分析用户图像，以提取驱动多种功能的见解。利用这种新的处理模型，我们分析了两个流行的社交媒体应用TikTok和Instagram，揭示这两个应用中的视觉模型从用户的图像和视频数据中推断出的见解，以及这些模型在不同人口统计数据方面是否表现出性能差异。由于视觉模型为诸如年龄验证和人脸识别等敏感技术提供信号，了解这些模型中潜在的偏见对于确保用户获得公平准确的服务至关重要。我们开发了一种捕获和评估移动应用中ML任务的新方法，克服了代码混淆、原生应用等挑战。",
