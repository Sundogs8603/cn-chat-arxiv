    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）因在学习同构或异构图的表示方面取得成功而备受关注。然而，它们在泛化到具有不同同态程度的现实世界图时表现不佳。为此，前作中提出的Possion-Charlier Network（PCNet）允许从异态到同态学习图表示。尽管PCNet缓解了异态问题，但在进一步提高有效性和效率方面仍存在一些挑战。本文简化了PCNet并增强了其鲁棒性。我们首先将滤波器阶数扩展到连续值并减少其参数。我们实现了两种具有自适应邻域大小的变体。理论分析显示我们的模型对于图结构扰动或对抗性攻击具有鲁棒性。通过在代表同构和异构图的各种数据集上进行半监督学习任务，我们验证了我们的方法。",
