    "translated_abstract": "自闭症谱系障碍（ASD）是一种神经发育障碍，其特征是各种社交认知挑战和重复行为模式。由于谱系的症状多样性，为ASD识别可靠的基于脑成像的生物标志一直是一个持久的挑战。该领域现有的基线已经在这个方向上取得了重要进展，但在性能和可解释性方面仍有改进空间。我们提出了\\emph {HyperGALE}，它基于超图，结合了学习的超边和门控注意力机制。这种方法大大提高了模型解释复杂脑图数据的能力，为ASD生物标志特征化提供了更深入的见解。在广泛的ABIDE II数据集上进行评估，\\emph {HyperGALE}不仅提高了可解释性，还在关键性能指标上表现出显著的增强",
