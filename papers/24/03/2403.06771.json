    "translated_abstract": "组群 - 如点的聚类或节点的社区 - 在处理各种数据挖掘任务时是基础的。在时间数据中，表征群体演化的主要方法一直是通过识别“事件”。然而，文献中通常描述的事件，例如收缩/增长、分裂/合并，往往是任意定义的，导致理论/预定义类型与真实数据群体观察之间存在差距。在超越现有分类的基础上，我们将事件视为由我们称为“面向”的一组特定定量维度的组合所特征化的“原型”。群体动态由它们在面向空间内的位置所定义，其中原型事件占据极端位置。因此，与强制执行严格的事件类型不同，我们的方法可以允许涉及到群体邻近多个原型的动态的混合描述。我们将我们的框架应用于来自多个实际数据集的群体演化。",
