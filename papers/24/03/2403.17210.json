    "translated_abstract": "药物-药物相互作用（DDIs）的研究是药物开发过程中的一个关键元素。DDIs发生在一个药物的性质受其他药物包含的影响时。检测有利的DDIs有可能为在实际设置中应用的创新药物的创造和推进铺平道路。然而，现有的DDI预测模型在极端情况下的泛化、稳健特征提取以及现实应用可能性方面持续面临挑战。我们旨在通过利用上下文感知深度图学习的有效性，引入一种名为CADGL的新颖框架来应对这些挑战。基于定制的变分图自编码器（VGAE），我们利用两个上下文预处理器从两个不同视角：局部邻域和分子上下文，在异质图结构中提取特征，捕获关键的结构和生理化学信息。",
