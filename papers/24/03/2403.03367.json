    "translated_abstract": "自动做市商（AMMs）已成为区块链上去中心化交易所的主要市场机制。本文提出了一个针对AMMs两个重要未解决问题的单一机制：减少对有信息的订单流的损失，最大化对无信息的订单流的收益。这个“拍卖管理的AMM”通过在链上进行一次不受审查的拍卖，以临时行使“流动性池管理者”职能的权利。流动性池管理者设置池的交换费率，并从交换中获得的费用。流动性池管理者可以通过针对小价格波动而对冲流动性池来独占一些套利，并且可以设置交换费用，包括零售订单流的价格敏感性，并适应不断变化的市场条件，最终将两者的收益归结为流动性提供方。流动性提供方可以进入和退出池…",
