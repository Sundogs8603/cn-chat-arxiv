    "translated_abstract": "使用基于扩散的模型对具有SE(3)-不变性的可行3D结构（例如分子和点云）进行采样，在各种现实应用中证明了其前景，其中SE(3)-不变性属性可以通过点之间的距离流形自然地表征。然而，由于非平凡的几何形状，我们仍然缺乏对这种SE(3)-不变空间内扩散机制的全面理解。本研究通过数学上描绘在SE(3)-不变性下的扩散机制，通过微分几何的视角深入分析坐标之间的相互作用行为和点之间的距离流形。在这一分析的基础上，我们相应地提出了准确且无需投影的扩散SDE和ODE。这些公式不仅能够提高生成路径的性能和速度，同时还为包含SE(3)-不变性的其他系统提供了宝贵的见解。",
