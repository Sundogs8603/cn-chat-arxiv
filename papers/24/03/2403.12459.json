    "translated_abstract": "深度表示在以黑盒方式转移到下游任务时表现出了良好的性能。然而，它们固有的不可解释性仍然是一个重大挑战，因为这些特征通常对人类理解而言是不透明的。在本文中，我们提出了非负对比学习（NCL），这是对非负矩阵分解（NMF）的复兴，旨在得出可解释的特征。NCL的力量在于强制将非负约束应用于特征，这让人想起NMF能够提取与样本集群紧密对齐的特征的能力。NCL不仅在数学上与NMF目标很好地对齐，而且保留了NMF的可解释属性，使得与标准对比学习（CL）相比，得到了更加稀疏和解耦的表示。从理论上，我们为NCL的可识别性和下游泛化性能提供了保证。从经验上看，我们展示了这些",
