    "translated_abstract": "这封信件：（i）重新表述了Adler-Daskalakis-Papadimitriou（2009）和Raimondo（2023）关于两人对抗游戏的定理，将其作为带有简化证明的广义结果，（ii）连接了Moulin-Vial（1978）关于策略零和游戏的工作，以及Fishburn-Roberts（1976，1978）关于多线性收益的n人游戏的公理化。提供的简化和连接突出了Aumann（1961）、Shapley（1964）和Rosenthal（1974）研究的两人零和游戏，以及计算机科学领域的最新算法工作。我们通过将两个社区汇聚在对抗游戏的总纲下，为该主题提供了富有成效的重新定向。",
