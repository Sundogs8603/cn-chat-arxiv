    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.18121v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent advances in interactive large language models like ChatGPT have revolutionized various domains; however, their behavior in natural and role-play conversation settings remains underexplored. In our study, we address this gap by deeply investigating how ChatGPT behaves during conversations in different settings by analyzing its interactions in both a normal way and a role-play setting. We introduce a novel dataset of broad range of human-AI conversations annotated with user motives and model naturalness to examine (i) how humans engage with the conversational AI model, and (ii) how natural are AI model responses. Our study highlights the diversity of user motives when interacting with ChatGPT and variable AI naturalness, showing not only the nuanced dynamics of natural conversations between humans and AI, but also providing new avenues for improving the effectiveness of human-AI communication.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，像ChatGPT这样的互动型大型语言模型的发展已经彻底改变了各个领域；然而，它们在自然和角色扮演对话环境中的行为仍未得到充分探讨。在我们的研究中，我们通过深入分析ChatGPT在不同环境中的对话中的表现，特别是在正常对话和角色扮演设置中的互动，来填补这一空白。我们引入了一个新颖的数据集，其中包含广泛范围的人机对话，带有用户动机和模型自然度的注释，以研究（i）人类如何与对话AI模型交互，以及（ii）AI模型响应的自然度。我们的研究突显了用户与ChatGPT互动时的动机多样性和AI自然度的变化，不仅展示了人与AI之间自然对话的微妙动力学，而且为改进人机通信的有效性提供了新途径。",
