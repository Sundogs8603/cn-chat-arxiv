However, this high degree of spatial resolution entails a drawback, as the resulting spatial transcriptomic data at the cellular level is notably plagued by a high incidence of missing values. Furthermore, most existing imputation methods either overlook the spatial information between spots or compromise the overall gene expression data distribution. To address these challenges, our primary focus is on effectively utilizing the spatial location information within spatial transcriptomic data to impute missing values, while preserving the overall data distribution.

    "translated_abstract": "空间定位转录组学通过提供基因表达数据及其相应的物理位置，为单细胞分析带来了重大进展。然而，这种高度的空间分辨率却带来了一个缺点，即由于缺失值的高发生率，导致了细胞水平上的空间转录组数据明显受到困扰。此外，大多数现有的填补方法要么忽视不同点之间的空间信息，要么牺牲整体基因表达数据分布。为解决这些挑战，我们的主要关注点是有效利用空间定位转录组数据中的空间位置信息来填补缺失值，同时保持整体数据分布。我们引入了一种新颖的条件扩散模型stMCDI，利用使用随机掩码数据部分作为指导来训练去噪网络。",
