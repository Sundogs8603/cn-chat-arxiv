We collected and preprocessed data about first-year university students from different sources: theory classes, practical sessions, on-line Moodle sessions, and a final exam. Our objective was to discover which data fusion approach produced the best results using our data. We carried out experiments by applying four different data fusion approaches and six classification algorithms. The results showed that the best predictions were produced using ensembles and selecting the best attributes approach with discretized data. The best prediction models showed us that the level of attention in theory classes, scores in Moodle quizzes, and the level of activity in Moodle forums were the best set of attributes for predicting students' final performance in",

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我们应用数据融合方法来预测大学生在混合式学习环境中的最终学术表现，利用来自多个源头、多模态的数据。我们从不同来源收集和预处理了关于大一学生的数据：理论课、实践课、在线Moodle课程以及期末考试。我们的目标是发现哪种数据融合方法在我们的数据中产生了最好的结果。我们进行了实验，应用了四种不同的数据融合方法和六种分类算法。结果显示，集成和选择最佳属性方法与离散化数据一起产生了最佳预测结果。最佳预测模型显示，理论课上的关注程度、Moodle测验成绩以及Moodle论坛上的活动水平是预测学生最终表现的最佳属性集。",
