    "translated_abstract": "软件agent，无论是人类还是计算机，都不是独立存在的，通常需要与他人协作或协调以实现他们的目标。在人类社会中，规范等社会机制确保了有效的运行，研究人员在多Agent系统（MAS）中采用这些技术来创建具有社会意识的agent。然而，传统技术存在一些局限性，比如在有限环境中运作，通常使用脆弱的符号推理。大语言模型（LLMs）的出现提供了一个有希望的解决方案，提供了一个丰富和富有表现力的词汇表达规范，使能够执行一系列任务的具有规范功能的agent，如规范发现、规范推理和决策。本文研究了基于LLM的agent获得规范能力的潜力，借鉴了最近自然语言处理（NLP）和LLM研究。我们提出了创建规范LLM agent的愿景。",
