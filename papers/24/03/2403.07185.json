    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.07185v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been extensively used in various real-world applications. However, the predictive uncertainty of GNNs stemming from diverse sources such as inherent randomness in data and model training errors can lead to unstable and erroneous predictions. Therefore, identifying, quantifying, and utilizing uncertainty are essential to enhance the performance of the model for the downstream tasks as well as the reliability of the GNN predictions. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the GNNs from the perspective of uncertainty with an emphasis on its integration in graph learning. We compare and summarize existing graph uncertainty theory and methods, alongside the corresponding downstream tasks. Thereby, we bridge the gap between theory and practice, meanwhile connecting different GNN communities. Moreover, our work provides valuable insights into promising directions in this field.",

    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）已被广泛应用于各种现实世界的应用中。然而，GNNs的预测不确定性源自数据中的固有随机性和模型训练误差等多种因素，可能导致不稳定和错误的预测。因此，识别、量化和利用不确定性对于增强模型性能和GNN预测的可靠性是至关重要的。本调查旨在从不确定性的角度全面概述GNNs，并强调其在图学习中的整合。我们比较和总结了现有的图不确定性理论和方法，以及相应的下游任务。通过这种方式，我们弥合了理论与实践之间的差距，同时连接不同的GNN社区。此外，我们的工作为这一领域的未来方向提供了宝贵的见解。",
