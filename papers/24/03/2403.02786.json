Leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs), our approach constructs a subject similarity graph to identify risk patterns from health checkup data. The effectiveness of various GNN approaches in this context is demonstrated, even with minimal labeled samples. Central to our methodology is the inclusion of human-centric explanations through explainable GNNs, providing personalized feature importance scores for enhanced interpretability and clinical relevance, thereby underscoring the potential of our approach in advancing healthcare practices with a keen focus on graph representation learning and human-centric explanation.",
