We present a benchmark named ImplicitBench and conduct an investigation on the performance and impacts of implicit prompts with popular T2I models.

    "translated_abstract": "近期文本到图像（T2I）模型取得了巨大成功，并提出了许多基准来评估它们的性能和安全性。然而，它们只考虑了显式提示，而忽略了隐式提示（暗示目标而不明确提到）。这些提示可能消除安全约束，并对这些模型的应用构成潜在威胁。本文介绍了当下T2I模型朝着隐式提示的现状。我们提出了一个名为ImplicitBench的基准，并对流行的T2I模型在隐式提示下的性能和影响进行了调查。具体来说，我们设计并收集了三个方面的超过2,000个隐式提示：通用符号、名人隐私和不安全的问题，并评估了六个知名T2I模型在这些隐式提示下的能力。实验结果显示，（1）T2I模型能够准确地创建各种目标。",
