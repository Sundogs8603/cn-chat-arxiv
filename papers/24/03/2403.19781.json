However, traditional rule-based market simulators often fall short in accurately capturing the dynamic behavior of market participants, particularly in response to external market impact events or changes in the behavior of other participants. In this study, we explore an agent-based simulation framework employing reinforcement learning (RL) agents. We present the implementation details of these RL agents and demonstrate that the simulated market exhibits realistic stylized facts observed in real-world markets.

    "translated_abstract": "投资者和监管机构可以从一个现实的市场模拟器中受益，这个模拟器让他们能够预测他们在真实市场中的决策后果。然而，传统的基于规则的市场模拟器往往难以准确捕捉市场参与者的动态行为，特别是在外部市场影响事件或其他参与者行为变化时。在这项研究中，我们探索了一个采用强化学习代理的代理模拟框架。我们介绍了这些强化学习代理的实现细节，并证明了模拟市场展示了观察到的真实世界市场的风格化事实。此外，我们研究了当RL代理面临外部市场冲击时的行为，比如闪崩。我们的研究结果揭示了RL代理在模拟中的有效性和适应性，提供了关于它们应对外部影响的见解。",
