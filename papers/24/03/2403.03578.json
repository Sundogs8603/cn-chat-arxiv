In this paper, we propose a Causal Disentanglement-based framework for Regulating Social influence Bias in social recommendation, named CDRSB, to improve recommendation performance.

    "translated_abstract": "社交推荐系统面临着社交影响偏差的问题，这可能导致过分强调推荐朋友互动过的物品。解决这一问题至关重要，现有方法通常依赖于权重调整或利用无偏数据来消除这种偏差。然而，我们认为并非所有偏差都是有害的，即一些朋友推荐的物品可能与用户的兴趣相符。盲目消除这些偏差可能会削弱这些积极影响，可能降低推荐准确性。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于因果分解的框架，用于调节社交推荐中的社交影响偏差，名为CDRSB，以提高推荐性能。从因果推断的角度来看，我们发现用户社交网络可以被视为用户和物品嵌入（处理）以及评分（结果）之间的共变量。",
