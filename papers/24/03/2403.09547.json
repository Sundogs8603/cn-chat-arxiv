    "translated_abstract": "持续集成（CI）是传统软件开发中一个成熟的实践，但在机器学习（ML）项目领域中的细节仍然相对未被探索。考虑到ML开发的独特性，了解CI实践在这一背景下的采用对于调整有效方法至关重要。本研究对GitHub上的185个开源项目进行全面分析（93个ML项目和92个非ML项目）。我们的调查涵盖了定量和定性维度，旨在揭示ML和非ML项目之间CI采用的差异。我们的发现表明，ML项目通常需要更长的构建时间，并且中等规模的ML项目与非ML项目相比具有较低的测试覆盖率。此外，小型和中等规模的ML项目显示出比其非ML对应项目更多的增长构建时间趋势的普遍性。",
