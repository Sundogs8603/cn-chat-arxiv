    "translated_abstract": "心电图（ECG）是临床实践中用于检测心律失常疾病的非侵入性诊断工具。在未经注释的ECG数据中进行自监督学习（eSSL）方法显示出了表征学习的潜力，但往往忽视了可以在报告中找到的临床知识。本文通过多模态学习ECG记录和相关报告，提出了Multimodal ECG Representation Learning (MERL)框架，该框架能够使用文本提示进行零样本ECG分类，消除了下游任务中对训练数据的需求。在测试时，我们提出了Clinical Knowledge Enhanced Prompt Engineering (CKEPE)方法，利用大型语言模型（LLM）来利用外部专家验证的临床知识数据库，生成更多关于患者病史的提示。",
