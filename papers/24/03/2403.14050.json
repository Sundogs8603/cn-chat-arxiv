In this paper, we applied an approach to sentiment analysis based on a question-answering framework. Our approach leverages the power of Bidirectional Autoregressive Transformer (BART), a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model, to extract a phrase from a given text that amplifies a given sentiment polarity. We create a natural language question that identifies the specific emotion to extract and then guide BART to pay attention to the relevant emotional cues in the text. We use a classifier within BART to predict the start and end positions of the answer span within the text, which helps to identify the precise boundaries of the extracted emotion phrase. Our",

    "translated_abstract": "情感分析是一项旨在识别和提取文本中情绪方面的自然语言处理任务。然而，许多现有的情感分析方法主要是对文本的整体极性进行分类，忽略了传达情绪的具体短语。在本文中，我们应用了一种基于问答框架的情感分析方法。我们利用双向自回归变换器（BART），一个预训练的序列到序列模型，从给定文本中提取放大给定情感极性的短语。我们创建一个自然语言问题，确定要提取的特定情绪，然后引导BART专注于文本中相关的情感线索。我们在BART中使用一个分类器来预测文本中答案跨度的开始和结束位置，从而帮助确定提取的情绪短语的精确边界。",
