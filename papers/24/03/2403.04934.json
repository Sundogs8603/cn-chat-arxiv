Our approach enables the gripper grasp objects with different physical properties on dynamic and force-interactive tasks. We utilize a vision-based tactile sensor, GelSight, which is capable of perceiving high-resolution tactile feedback that contains the information of physical properties and states of the grasped object.

    "translated_abstract": "抓取是机器人中的关键任务，需要触觉反馈和反应性抓取调整，以实现在各种条件下和具有不同物理属性的对象的稳健抓取。本文介绍了LeTac-MPC，一种基于学习的模型预测控制（MPC）用于触觉反应式抓取。我们的方法使夹爪能够在动态和力交互任务中抓取具有不同物理属性的对象。我们利用基于视觉的触觉传感器GelSight，该传感器能够感知包含抓取对象的物理属性和状态信息的高分辨率触觉反馈。LeTac-MPC包含一个可微分的MPC层，设计用于对通过神经网络（NN）从触觉反馈中提取的嵌入进行建模。这种设计有助于在25 Hz的频率下实现收敛和稳健的抓取控制。我们提出了一个完全自动化的数据收集流程，并收集了一组数据集。",
