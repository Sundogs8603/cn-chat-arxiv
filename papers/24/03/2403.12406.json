    "translated_abstract": "在动态和快节奏的基于轮次的体育运动中，羽毛球作为一种需要选手依赖变化的决策的固有范例而脱颖而出。虽然在顺序决策的离线专家数据中学习的进展在各个领域中都有所涉及，但如何从离线羽毛球比赛中模仿人类选手的比赛行为在很大程度上尚未被探索。复制对手的行为有益于选手，使他们能够在比赛前有方向地进行战略发展。然而，直接应用现有方法会受到比赛的内在层次结构和由于轮流采取行动的选手轮次性质而产生的复合效应的困扰。在本文中，我们提出了RallyNet，一种新颖的用于羽毛球运动员行为的分层离线模仿学习模型：（i）RallyNet通过将决策过程建模为...",
