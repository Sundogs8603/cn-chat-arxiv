Inpainting has countless applications including restoring previously damaged pictures, restoring the quality of images that have been degraded due to compression, and removing unwanted objects/text.

    "translated_abstract": "图像修复是将图像输入并生成丢失或故意遮挡部分的过程。修复有无数应用，包括恢复先前损坏的图片、恢复由于压缩而降低质量的图像，以及删除不需要的物体/文本。现代修复技术已经显示出在为具有遮罩遮挡的图像生成合理完成方面的显着能力。在本文中，我们将提供修复技术进展的概述，并确定当前领先方法，重点放在它们的优势和劣势上。我们将解决这些现有模型中的一个关键差距，重点是促进和控制生成的确切内容的能力。我们还将证明为什么我们认为这是修复模型必须采取的自然的下一个进步步骤，并提供实现这一功能的多种方法。最后，我们将e",
