OntoClean, critical for assessing the metaphysical quality of ontologies, involves a two-step process of assigning meta-properties to classes and verifying a set of constraints. Manually conducting the first step proves difficult in practice, due to the need for philosophical expertise and lack of consensus among ontologists. By employing LLMs with two prompting strategies, the study demonstrates that high accuracy in the labelling process can be achieved. The findings suggest the potential for LLMs to enhance ontology refinement, proposing the development of plugin software for ontology tools to facilitate this integration.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了将GPT-3.5和GPT-4等大型语言模型（LLMs）整合到本体重构过程中的方法，重点关注OntoClean方法论。OntoClean对评估本体的形而上质量至关重要，涉及将元属性分配给类别的两步过程和验证一组约束条件。手动完成第一步在实践中很困难，因为需要哲学专业知识和本体论者之间缺乏共识。通过采用两种提示策略的LLMs，研究表明可以实现高准确率的标记过程。研究结果表明LLMs有提升本体重构的潜力，提出开发本体工具的插件软件以促进这种整合。",
