Finally, an expedited genetic algorithm is used to align N independent Tsetlin Machines by maximising hamming distance. For MNIST level classification problems, results demonstrate up to 10% improvement in accuracy, approx. 383X reduction in training time and approx. 86X reduction in inference time.",
