    "translated_abstract": "道德在我们感知信息、影响决策和判断过程中起着基础性作用。包括疫苗接种、堕胎、种族主义和性取向在内的有争议话题往往引发的意见和态度并非仅基于证据，而更多反映了道德世界观。最近自然语言处理的进展表明，道德价值可以从人类生成的文本内容中得到判断。本文设计了一系列旨在捕捉文本中道德微妙之处的语言表示模型，称为MoralBERT。我们利用来自三个不同来源（Twitter、Reddit和Facebook）的带有注释的道德数据，涵盖各种社会相关主题。这种方法扩大了语言多样性，可能增强模型在不同上下文中理解道德的能力。我们还探讨了一种领域自适应技术，并将其与标准的微调方法进行了比较。",
