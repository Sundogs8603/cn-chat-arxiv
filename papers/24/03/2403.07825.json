    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型以其卓越的效果彻底改变了许多任务。然而，对这些模型进行编辑，以修改过时或错误信息的关键性工作，往往会导致一个称为“隐藏空间中的涟漪效应”的复杂问题。这种效应虽然难以检测，但却会显著阻碍模型编辑任务的效果，并恶化模型性能。本文通过提出一种新颖的评估方法，基于图形特异值关系的评估(GORA)，来应对这一科学挑战，量化评估模型的适应性和编辑的后续影响。此外，我们引入了一种旨在减轻这种涟漪效应的模型编辑方法——选择性异常值重新编辑方法(SORA)。我们的全面评估揭示了隐藏空间中的涟漪效应在所有当前模型编辑方法中都是一个重要问题。然而，我们提出的方法，G",
