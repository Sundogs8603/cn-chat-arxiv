    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.16452v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study examines the factors influencing the short-term real effective exchange rate (REER) in Uruguay by applying an extended Mundell-Fleming model. Analyzing the impact of the US lending rate (USLR), money supply (M2), inflation (CPI), and the world interest rate (WIR), the paper uses a linear regression model with Newey-West standard errors. Key findings reveal that an increase in the USLR, CPI, and M2 is associated with a depreciation of the REER. In contrast, WIR shows no significant impact. These findings are consistent with the theoretical expectations of the Mundell-Fleming model regarding open economies under floating exchange rates. Therefore, authorities should tighten monetary policy, control inflation, adjust fiscal strategies, and boost exports in response to Peso depreciation.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究通过应用扩展的门德尔-弗莱明模型来分析影响乌拉圭短期实际有效汇率（REER）的因素。通过分析美国贷款利率（USLR）、货币供应量（M2）、通货膨胀（CPI）和世界利率（WIR）的影响，该论文采用具有Newey-West标准误差的线性回归模型。关键发现显示，美国贷款利率（USLR）、通货膨胀（CPI）和货币供应量（M2）的增加与实际有效汇率的贬值相关。相反，世界利率（WIR）没有显著影响。这些发现与有浮动汇率的开放型经济在门德尔-弗莱明模型中的理论预期一致。因此，当面对比索贬值时，当局应该收紧货币政策、控制通货膨胀、调整财政策略，并促进出口。",
