    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们探讨了使用逻辑规则来解释法律案例检索结果的问题。这项任务对于法律案例检索至关重要，因为用户（如律师或法官）具有高度专业化，需要系统在做出法律决策之前提供逻辑、忠实和可解释的解释。最近，研究工作旨在学习可解释的法律案例检索模型。然而，这些方法通常从法律案例中选择基本原理（关键句）作为解释，未能提供忠实和逻辑正确的解释。在本文中，我们提出了神经符号增强的法律案例检索（NS-LCR）框架，该框架通过学习案例级别和法律级别的逻辑规则来明确地对法律案例的匹配进行推理。然后将学习到的规则以神经符号方式集成到检索过程中。由于逻辑和可解释性的特性...",
