To tackle these issues, we introduce two key components, a data augmentation pipeline incorporating LLM-assisted pseudo-labelling and sentence rephrasing, and a voting ensemble from three models pre-trained on Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks and fine-tuned on diverse datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "在自然语言生成（NLG）中，当代大型语言模型（LLM）面临着一些挑战，例如生成流畅但不准确的输出以及依赖于流畅性为中心的度量。这经常导致神经网络出现“幻觉”。SHROOM挑战旨在自动识别生成文本中的这些幻觉。为了解决这些问题，我们引入了两个关键组件，一个数据增强流水线，包括LLM辅助的伪标记和句子改写，以及一个投票集成来自三个在自然语言推理（NLI）任务上预训练并在不同数据集上微调的模型。",
