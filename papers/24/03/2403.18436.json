    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我们研究了在有条件信任环境中的协作式主动学习，这是一种多个合作者通过利用其结合的机器学习能力来探索一个新领域的范例，而不需透露他们现有的数据和模型。相反，合作者们分享来自新领域的预测结果和新获得的标签。这种协作提供了几个优势：(a) 通过消除直接的模型和数据披露需求，解决了隐私和安全问题；(b) 无需直接数据交换，实现了利用不同数据源和洞见；以及(c) 通过共享标记成本，促进了成本效益和资源效率。为了实现这些好处，我们引入了一个设计用于实现上述目标的协作式主动学习框架。我们通过仿真验证了所提出框架的有效性。结果表明，协作会导致更高的AUC分数。",
