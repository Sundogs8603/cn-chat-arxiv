Detecting DeepFakes is currently solved with programmed machine learning algorithms. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs) in DeepFake detection. We conducted qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate multimodal LLMs and show that they can expose AI-generated images through careful experimental design and prompt engineering. This is interesting, considering that LLMs are not inherently tailored for media forensic tasks, and the process does not require programming.

    "translated_abstract": "DeepFakes是指由人工智能生成的媒体内容，由于其被用作散布虚假信息的手段，已经成为越来越令人担忧的问题。当前检测DeepFakes的方法是利用编程的机器学习算法。本研究调查了多模态大型语言模型（LLMs）在DeepFake检测中的能力。通过定性和定量实验，我们展示了多模态LLMs可以通过谨慎的实验设计和及时的工程方法揭示AI生成的图像。考虑到LLMs并不是本质上为媒体取证任务量身定制的，这一点相当有趣，而且这个过程并不需要编程。我们讨论了多模态LLMs在这些任务中的局限性，并提出了可能的改进方向。",
