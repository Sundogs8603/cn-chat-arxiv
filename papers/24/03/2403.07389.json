While Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are well established, the associated cycle consistency constrain relies on that an invertible mapping exists between the two domains. This is, however, not the case for the translation between images stained with chromogenic monoplex and duplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. Focusing on the translation from the latter to the first, we propose - through the introduction of a novel training design, an alternative constrain leveraging a set of immunofluorescence (IF) images as an auxiliary unpaired image domain.

    "translated_abstract": "生成模型使得从一个源图像域到一个在训练中未见过的目标域的转换成为可能。虽然Cycle生成对抗网络（GANs）已经被广泛应用，但其中的循环一致性约束依赖于两个域之间存在可逆映射的情况，而在染色单向和双向免疫组化（IHC）检测的图像之间的转换不是这样的。针对从后者到前者的转换，我们提出了一种新颖的训练设计，引入了一种新的约束，利用一组免疫荧光（IF）图像作为辅助的不配对图像域。在下游分割任务上的定量和定性结果显示，相比基线方法，所提出的方法带来了显著的好处。",
