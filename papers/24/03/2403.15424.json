    "translated_abstract": "人类活动识别（HAR）是普适计算的基石，具有在健康监测和环境辅助生活等多个领域中有前景的应用。尽管取得了显著进展，基于传感器的HAR方法通常在训练和测试数据具有相同分布的假设下运作。然而，在许多现实场景中，特别是在基于传感器的HAR中，这一假设因分布之外的挑战而无效，包括来自异构传感器的差异、随时间变化以及个体行为变异。本文聚焦于后者，探索跨用户HAR问题，其中个体之间的行为变异导致不同数据分布。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了Deep Temporal State Domain Adaptation（DTSDA）模型，这是一种为跨用户HAR中的时间序列领域自适应量身定制的创新方法。",
