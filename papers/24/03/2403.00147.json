    "translated_abstract": "通过选择适当的函数空间作为非负度量锥的对偶，我们在一个统一的框架下研究了一类功能鞍点优化问题，我们将其称为混合功能纳什均衡(MFNE)，这是一些现有机器学习算法的基础，如隐式生成模型、分布鲁棒优化(DRO)和Wasserstein质心。 当函数空间选择为再生核希尔伯特空间(RKHS)时，我们将鞍点优化动态建模为相互作用的Fisher-Rao-RKHS梯度流。作为离散时间对应物，我们提出了一种原始-对偶核镜像Prox(KMP)算法，该算法在RKHS中使用对偶步骤和原始熵镜像Prox步骤。 然后，我们在无限维设置下为这类MFNE问题提供了KMP的统一收敛分析，这在确定性情况下建立了一个$O(1/N)$的收敛速度。",
