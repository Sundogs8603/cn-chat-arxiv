    "translated_abstract": "脂质组学生成大量数据，使得手动标注和解释变得具有挑战性。脂质的化学和结构多样性以及结构异构体进一步复杂了标注过程。尽管存在多种用于目标脂质鉴定的商业和开源软件，但缺乏自动生成工作流程以及与统计和生物信息学工具集成的自动化方法。我们开发了全面脂质组学自动化工作流程（CLAW）平台，带有基于定制多反应监测（MRM）前体和产物离子对转换的解析、详细的统计分析和脂质标注集成工作流程。CLAW包含多个模块，包括在与臭氧电喷雾电离（OzESI）-MRM方法相结合时识别不饱和脂质的碳碳双键位置。为展示CLAW中自动化工作流程的实用性，进行了大规模脂质组学数据收集。",
