    "translated_abstract": "在科学研究及其应用中，科学文献分析至关重要，因为它使研究人员能够借鉴他人的工作。然而，科学知识的快速增长导致学术文章数量大幅增加，使深入文献分析变得越来越具挑战性和耗时。大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现为解决这一挑战提供了新途径。以其在总结文本方面的强大能力而闻名，LLMs被视为改进科学文献分析的潜在工具。然而，现有的LLMs存在其局限性。科学文献通常包括各种多模态元素，如分子结构、表格和图表，这些对以文本为中心的LLMs而言难以理解和分析。这个问题指向了迫切需要新的解决方案，能够充分理解和分析科学文献中的多模态内容。为了应对这一需求...",
