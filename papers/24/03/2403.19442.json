    "translated_abstract": "在不断发展的心理病理学领域中，准确评估和预测从生态瞬时评估（EMA）获取的数据至关重要。EMA提供随时间丰富的情境性心理病理测量，实际上会导致多元时间序列（MTS）数据。因此，分析中会出现许多挑战，源于情绪、行为和情境EMA数据固有的时间复杂性以及它们之间的相互依赖性。为了解决这两个方面，本研究调查了循环和时间图神经网络（GNN）的表现。总体而言，通过合并反映变量之间内部关系的图中的额外信息，GNN显着提高了结果，将均方误差（MSE）从1.02降低到0.84，与基线LSTM模型相比。因此，还探讨了利用不同特征构建图对GNN性能的影响。",
