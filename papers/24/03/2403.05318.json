    "translated_abstract": "许多现实世界中的问题可以被定式为具有约束的旅行商问题（TSP）。然而，这些约束通常复杂而且数量众多，使得解决TSP变得具有挑战性。当复杂约束的数量增长时，传统启发式算法花费大量时间以避免不合法结果。基于学习的方法提供了一种软方式来解决TSP问题，同时支持GPU加速以快速生成解决方案。然而，软方法不可避免地导致通过学习算法解决硬约束问题变得困难，而合法性和最优性之间的冲突可能会严重影响解决方案的最优性。为了克服这一问题并对抗硬约束提出了一种新颖的基于学习的方法，该方法利用向前展望信息作为特征来改进具有时间窗口（TSPTW）的TSP解决方案的合法性。",
