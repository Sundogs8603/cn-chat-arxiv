    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.05700v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Social scientists increasingly use demographically stratified social media data to study the attitudes, beliefs, and behavior of the general public. To facilitate such analyses, we construct, validate, and release publicly the representative DADIT dataset of 30M tweets of 20k Italian Twitter users, along with their bios and profile pictures. We enrich the user data with high-quality labels for gender, age, and location. DADIT enables us to train and compare the performance of various state-of-the-art models for the prediction of the gender and age of social media users. In particular, we investigate if tweets contain valuable information for the task, since popular classifiers like M3 don't leverage them. Our best XLM-based classifier improves upon the commonly used competitor M3 by up to 53% F1. Especially for age prediction, classifiers profit from including tweets as features. We also confirm these findings on a German test set.",

    "translated_abstract": "社会科学家越来越多地使用人口统计分层的社交媒体数据来研究一般公众的态度、信念和行为。为了促进这样的分析，我们构建、验证并公开发布了具有30M条推特的20k意大利推特用户的代表性DADIT数据集，以及他们的个人简介和个人头像。我们为用户数据添加了高质量的性别、年龄和位置标签。DADIT使我们能够训练和比较各种最先进模型的性能，用于预测社交媒体用户的性别和年龄。特别是，我们调查了推文是否包含有价值的信息，因为像M3这样的流行分类器并未利用它们。我们最好的基于XLM的分类器在F1分数上比常用对手M3提高了高达53%。对于年龄预测，分类器从包含推文作为特征中获益。我们还在一个德国测试集上确认了这些发现。",
    "tldr": "该研究构建了意大利推特用户人口分类数据集DADIT，用于预测社交媒体用户的性别和年龄，发现包含推文特征在年龄预测中特别有效，XLM-based分类器在性能上优于常用的M3分类器最多可提高53% F1分数。",
