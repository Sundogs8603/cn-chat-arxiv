    "translated_abstract": "建筑知识管理（AKM）涉及对项目或组织中与建筑决策和设计相关信息的有组织处理。AKM的一个重要产物是架构决策记录（ADR），它记录关键设计决策。 ADR是捕捉决策背景、已做出的决策以及与设计决策相关的各个方面的文件，从而促进透明度、协作和理解。 尽管它们有益处，但由于时间限制和参与度不一致等挑战，ADR在软件开发中的采用速度较慢。 大语言模型（LLMs）的最新进展可能有助于弥合这种采用差距，通过促进ADR的生成。 但是，LLM用于ADR生成或理解的效果尚未得到探究。 因此，在这项工作中，我们进行了一项旨在调查使用LLM进行的可行性的探索性研究",
