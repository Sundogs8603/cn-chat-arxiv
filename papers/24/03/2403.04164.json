    "translated_abstract": "随着提出了Segment Anything Model (SAM)的建议，对SAM进行医学图像分割(MIS)的微调变得流行起来。然而，由于SAM模型的规模较大，自然图像和医学图像之间存在显著的领域差距，基于微调的策略成本高，存在不稳定性、特征损伤和灾难性遗忘的潜在风险。此外，一些通过微调策略将SAM转移到特定领域MIS的方法禁用了模型的提示能力，严重限制了其使用场景。在本文中，我们提出了一个自动提示模块（APM），为SAM基础模型在目标域中提供了具有欧几里德自适应提示的基础。我们的实验证明，这样的自适应提示显著提高了SAM在MIS中非微调的性能。此外，我们提出了一种名为增量模式移位（IPS）的新型非侵入式方法，用于将SAM调整到特定医疗领域。",
