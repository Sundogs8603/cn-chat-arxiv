    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我们介绍了一项关于LLMs在技术语言处理任务中性能评估研究的结果。人类经常面临需要从不同来源收集信息并需要理解大量文本的任务。这些任务对人类来说可能非常复杂，通常需要深入研究，包括多次阅读文本的部分内容。为了简化信息收集的任务，我们评估了LLMs在聊天界面上的表现，评估它们是否能够回答标准问题，这些问题可以基于人类对文本内容的阅读来预期人类能够回答。我们研究的文本为《美国联邦法规》第47章《美国法典》，这一章描述了作为联邦通信委员会（FCC）管理下商用电信的规定。这一段文本是我们感兴趣的研究对象，因为我们更广泛的研究涉及机器处理这类文本时遇到的困难。",
