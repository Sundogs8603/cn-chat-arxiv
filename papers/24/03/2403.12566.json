Existing sequential recommendation models often fail to capture long-term dependencies or are too complex, complicating the fulfillment of Meituan Waimai's unique business needs. To better model user interests, we consider selecting relevant sub-sequences from users' extensive historical behaviors based on their preferences. In this specific scenario, we've noticed that the contexts in which users interact have a significant impact on their preferences. For this purpose, we introduce a novel method called Context-based Fast Recommendation Strategy to tackle the issue of long sequences. We first identify contexts that share similar user preferences with the target context and then locate the corresponding PoIs based on these identified contexts. This approach",
