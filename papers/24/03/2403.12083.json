    "translated_abstract": "公司名称消歧的问题在从专利中提取有用信息方面提出了重大挑战。这个问题会导致研究结果存在偏差，因为它在很大程度上低估了归因于公司的专利数量，特别是那些以众多名称（包括相同实体的替代拼写和最终公司的子公司）申请专利的跨国公司。迄今为止，解决这些挑战主要依赖于耗时的基于词典或字符串匹配方法，而大多数情况下解决大型数据集上专利受让人的协调问题仍未得到解决。为填补这一空白，本文描述了 Terrorizer 算法，这是一种文本算法，利用自然语言处理（NLP）、网络理论和基于规则的技术来协调作为专利受让人记录的公司名称的变体。具体而言，该算法遵循其前体的三部分结构",
