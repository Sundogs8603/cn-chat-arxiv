    "translated_abstract": "组织病理学是癌症诊断的黄金标准，在显微镜下进行检查。然而，组织病理学处理过程会产生一些工件，最终会转移到玻璃载玻片的数字化版本，即全玻幻灯片。工件是诊断无关的区域，可能导致错误的深度学习算法预测。因此，在计算病理学（CPATH）系统中检测和排除工件对于可靠的自动诊断至关重要。在本文中，我们提出了一种专家混合（MoE）方案，用于检测包括损坏组织、模糊、褶皱组织、气泡和在WSIs中的组织学无关血液等五种显著工件。首先，我们训练独立的二元DL模型作为专家来捕捉特定的工件形态。然后，我们使用融合机制来集成它们的预测。我们对最终的概率进行概率阈值处理",
