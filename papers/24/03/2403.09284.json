Existing personalized federated learning models prefer to aggregate similar clients with similar data distribution to improve the performance of learning models. However, similaritybased personalized federated learning methods may exacerbate the class imbalanced problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic Affinity-based Personalized Federated Learning model (DA-PFL) to alleviate the class imbalanced problem during federated learning. Specifically, we build an affinity metric from a complementary perspective to guide which clients should be aggregated.

    "translated_abstract": "个性化联邦学习成为一个热门的研究课题，可以为每个客户端学习个性化的学习模型。现有的个性化联邦学习模型倾向于聚合数据分布相似的客户端以提高学习模型的性能。然而，基于相似性的个性化联邦学习方法可能加剧类不平衡问题。本文提出了一种新颖的基于动态关联的个性化联邦学习模型（DA-PFL），以减轻联邦学习中的类不平衡问题。具体而言，我们从一个互补的角度构建了一种关联度量来引导哪些客户端应该被聚合。然后，我们设计了一种动态聚合策略，根据每一轮的关联度量动态聚合客户端，以减少类不平衡风险。大量实验证明，所提出的DA-PFL模型可以显著提高每个客户端的准确性。",
