To unpack this heterogeneity, the analysis combines longitudinal multi-topic household survey data from Nigeria with a causal machine learning approach, tailored to a conceptual framework bridging economic migration theory and the poverty traps literature. The results show that pre-shock asset levels, in situ adaptive capacity, and cumulative shock exposure drive not just the magnitude but also the sign of the impact of agriculture-relevant weather anomalies on the mobility outcomes of farming households. While local adaptation acts as a substitute for migration, the roles played by wealth constraints and repeated shock exposure suggest the presence of climate-induced immobility traps.",

    "translated_abstract": "气候冲击、迁移和适应之间的复杂关系妨碍了对暴露于气候风险的农户异质性迁移结果的深刻理解。为了解开这种异质性，分析将尼日利亚的纵向多主题家庭调查数据与定制的因果机器学习方法相结合，以一个桥接经济迁移理论和贫困陷阱文献的概念框架为基础。结果显示，冲击前资产水平、现场适应能力和累积冲击暴露驱动了农户迁移结果对农业相关气象异常影响的大小和影响符号。尽管当地适应充当了迁移的替代品，但财富约束和重复冲击暴露所扮演的角色表明存在气候诱发的固化移动陷阱。",
