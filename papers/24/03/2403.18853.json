    "translated_abstract": "本研究调查了高耸物体处的闪电情况，并评估了东阿尔卑斯山及其周边地区上升闪电（UL）的风险。虽然不常见，但UL对风力涡轮机尤其构成威胁，因为其长时间电流可能会造成重大破坏。当前的风险评估方法忽视了气象条件的影响，可能低估了UL的风险。因此，本研究采用随机森林，一种机器学习技术，分析了在奥地利Gaisberg Tower测量的UL与35个较大尺度气象变量之间的关系。其中，较大尺度的向上速度、10米高度的风速和风向以及云物理变量提供了最相关的信息。随机森林以1 km^2的分辨率预测了研究区域的UL风险。强烈的地表临近风与受高地形上升的偏转相结合会增加UL风险。UL的日变化周期",
