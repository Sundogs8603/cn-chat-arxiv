First, an unidentifiable causal effect may become identifiable when certain variables are functional. Second, certain functional variables can be excluded from being observed without affecting the identifiability of a causal effect, which may significantly reduce the number of needed variables in observational data.

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了因果效应的识别，受两个改进的启发，可以在已知因果图中某些变量是由它们的父节点功能决定的情况下实现。第一，当某些变量是功能的时，一个不可识别的因果效应可能变得可识别。第二，可以排除观测某些功能变量而不影响因果效应的可识别性，这可能会显著减少需要的观测数据中的变量数量。我们的结果在很大程度上基于一个排除过程，该过程从因果图中删除功能变量，同时保留结果因果图中的关键属性，包括因果效应的可识别性。",
