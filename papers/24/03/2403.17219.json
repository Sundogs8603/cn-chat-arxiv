These approaches typically rely on longitudinal collection of self-reported outcomes, e.g., depression, stress, and anxiety, to train machine learning (ML) models. However, the need to continuously self-report adds a significant burden on the participants, often resulting in attrition, missing labels, or insincere responses. In this work, we introduce the Scale Scores Simulation using Mental Models (SeSaMe) framework to alleviate participants' burden in digital mental health studies. By leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs), SeSaMe enables the simulation of participants' responses on psychological scales. In SeSaMe, researchers can prompt LLMs with information on participants' internal behavioral dispositions, enabling LLMs to construct mental models of participants to simulate ",

    "translated_abstract": "移动和可穿戴技术的进步使得可以被动监测一个人的心理、行为和情感健康的潜力成为可能。这些方法通常依赖于自我报告结果的长期收集，例如抑郁、压力和焦虑，以训练机器学习（ML）模型。然而，持续自我报告会给参与者带来重大负担，经常导致流失、缺失标签或不真诚的回应。在这项工作中，我们介绍了使用心理模型模拟规模分数的SeSaMe框架，以减轻数字心理健康研究中参与者的负担。通过利用预先训练的大型语言模型（LLMs），SeSaMe能够模拟参与者在心理量表上的回应。",
