    "translated_abstract": "机器学习（ML）易受针对ML模型的对抗攻击影响，这些攻击旨在欺骗ML模型，使其产生错误预测。 对抗训练被发现能提高ML模型对这些攻击的鲁棒性。然而，在网络和网络安全领域，获取标记训练和对抗训练数据是具有挑战性且昂贵的。此外，概念漂移加深了挑战，特别是在诸如网络和网络安全等动态领域中，需要各种模型进行定期重新训练。本文介绍了自适应连续对抗训练（ACAT），以在持续的学习会话期间持续将对抗训练样本整合到模型中，使用实际检测到的对抗数据，以增强模型对不断演变的对抗威胁的抵抗能力。 ACAT是一种自适应的防御机制，利用定期重新训练来有效对抗对抗攻击，同时减轻灾难性后果。",
