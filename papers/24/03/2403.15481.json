While prior research on the fairness of AI/ML exists, there is a lack of empirical studies focused on understanding the views and experiences of AI practitioners in developing a fair AI/ML. Understanding AI practitioners' views and experiences on the fairness of AI/ML is important because they are directly involved in its development and deployment and their insights can offer valuable real-world perspectives on the challenges associated with ensuring fairness in AI/ML. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 AI practitioners to investigate their understanding of what a 'fair AI/ML' is, the challenges they face in developing a fair AI/ML, the consequences of developing an unfair AI/ML, and the strategies they employ to ensure AI/ML fairness.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，各行业对AI/ML应用的增加引发了对AI/ML公平性的更多讨论。虽然已有关于AI/ML公平性的先前研究，但缺乏针对了解AI从业者在开发公平AI/ML过程中的观点和经验的实证研究。了解AI从业者对AI/ML公平性的看法和经验很重要，因为他们直接参与其中的开发和部署，他们的见解可以提供有价值的现实世界视角，帮助理解确保AI/ML公平性所涉及挑战的重要性。我们进行了22位AI从业者的半结构化访谈，以调查他们对“公平AI/ML”是什么的理解，他们在开发公平AI/ML中面临的挑战，开发不公平AI/ML的后果，以及他们采取的策略来确保AI/ML的公平性。我们制定了一个框架展示了",
