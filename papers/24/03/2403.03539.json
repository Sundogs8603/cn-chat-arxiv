Currently, the two main challenges for these approaches are the accurate prediction of contrast enhancement and the synthesis of realistic images. In this work, we address both challenges by utilizing the contrast signal encoded in the subtraction images of pre-contrast and post-contrast image pairs. To avoid the synthesis of any noise or artifacts and solely focus on contrast signal extraction and enhancement from low-dose subtraction images, we train our DL model using noise-free standard-dose subtraction images as targets. As a result, our model predicts the contrast enhancement signal only; thereby enabling synthesization of images beyond the standard dose. Furthermore, we adapt the embedding idea of recent diffusion-based models",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，提出了基于深度学习（DL）的方法来计算减少钆基造影剂（GBCAs）以减轻不良副作用同时保持诊断价值。目前，这些方法面临的两个主要挑战是准确预测对比增强和合成逼真图像。本研究通过利用预对比和后对比图像对的减法图像中编码的对比信号来解决这两个挑战。为了避免合成任何噪音或伪影，并仅专注于从低剂量减法图像中提取和增强对比信号，我们使用无噪声的标准剂量减法图像作为目标来训练我们的DL模型。因此，我们的模型仅预测对比增强信号；从而实现超出标准剂量的图像合成。此外，我们还借鉴了最近扩散模型的嵌入思想。",
