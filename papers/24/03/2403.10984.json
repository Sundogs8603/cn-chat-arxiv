    "translated_abstract": "为了提高隐私性和确保服务质量（QoS），深度学习（DL）模型越来越多地部署在物联网（IoT）设备上进行数据处理，极大地增加了与IoT上DL相关的碳足迹，涵盖了操作和实体方面。现有的操作能量预测器经常忽略了量化的DL模型和新兴的神经处理单元（NPUs），而实体碳足迹建模工具忽略了IoT设备中常见的非计算硬件组件，导致了物联网DL准确碳足迹建模工具的差距。本文介绍了\\textit{\\carb}，一种用于精确估算物联网DL中碳足迹的端到端建模工具，展示了与各种DL模型的实际测量值相比最大$\\pm21\\%$的碳足迹差异。此外，\\carb的实际应用通过多个用户案例展示。",
