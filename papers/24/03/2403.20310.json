According to the nature of export, import, GDP, and ICT functions, and the characteristics of nonlinearity, this analysis is performed by using the MPL neural network. The export, import, GDP, and ICT findings were examined with 99 percent accuracy. Using the P-VAR model in the Eviews software, the initial database and predicted data were applied to estimate the impact of e-commerce on international trade. The findings from analyzing the data show that there is a bilateral correlation between e-commerce which means that ICT and international trade affect each other and the Goodness of fit of the studied model is confirmed.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在利用人工智能方法和P-VAR模型，预测对经合组织国家和伊朗的电子商务指标对国际贸易的影响。根据出口、进口、GDP和ICT功能的特性以及非线性特点，采用MPL神经网络进行分析。出口、进口、GDP和ICT的研究结果表明，准确率达到99%。通过在Eviews软件中使用P-VAR模型，将初始数据库和预测数据应用于估计电子商务对国际贸易的影响。分析数据的结果显示，电子商务之间存在双边相关关系，即ICT和国际贸易互相影响，研究模型的拟合度得到确认。",
