    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)是人工智能进步的基础，推动了诸如预测文本生成之类的应用。然而，它们可能会通过潜在地记忆和传播来自庞大数据集的敏感、偏见或受版权保护的信息，因此存在风险。机器遗忘作为一个前沿解决方案应运而生，提供了供LLMs有选择性地丢弃某些数据的技术。本文回顾了针对LLMs的机器遗忘的最新进展，介绍了用于有针对性地遗忘信息以解决隐私、道德和法律挑战的方法，而不需要进行完整模型重新训练。它将现有研究分为来自非结构化/文本数据和结构化/分类数据的遗忘，展示了这些方法在删除特定数据的同时保持模型有效性的有效性。强调机器遗忘的实用性，本分析还指出了其中的障碍。",
