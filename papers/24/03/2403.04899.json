    "translated_abstract": "时空场景图通过将场景分解为单个对象及其两两时间关系来表示视频中的相互作用。长期预测对象之间精细粒度的两两关系是一个具有挑战性的问题。为此，我们引入了场景图预测（SGA）任务。我们将最先进的场景图生成方法用作基线，以预测对象之间未来的两两关系，并提出了一种新颖的方法SceneSayer。在SceneSayer中，我们利用面向对象的关系表示来推断观察到的视频帧并建模对象之间关系的演变。我们采用连续时间视角，并分别使用神经ODE和神经SDE的概念来建模对象相互作用的潜在动态演变。我们通过解决普通微分方程和随机微分方程来推断未来关系的表示。",
