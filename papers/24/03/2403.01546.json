However, the challenges of high dimensionality and limited spatial resolution hinder its effectiveness. This study addresses these challenges by employing deep learning techniques to efficiently process, extract features, and classify data in an integrated manner. To enhance spatial resolution, we integrate information from complementary modalities such as LiDAR and SAR data through multimodal learning. Moreover, adversarial learning and knowledge distillation are utilized to overcome issues stemming from domain disparities and missing modalities. We also tailor deep learning architectures to suit the unique characteristics of HSI data, utilizing 1D convolutional and recurrent neural networks to handle its continuous spectral dimension.
