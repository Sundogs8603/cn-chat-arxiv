    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的参数高效微调（PEFT）方法，称为自适应冻结低秩调整（AFLoRA）。具体地，对于每个预训练的冻结权重张量，我们添加一个可训练的低秩矩阵并行路径，即下投影和上投影矩阵，每个矩阵后面跟着一个特征变换向量。基于一种新颖的冻结分数，我们在微调过程中逐步冻结这些投影矩阵，以减少计算量并减轻过拟合。我们的实验结果表明，我们可以在GLUE基准测试中获得最先进的性能，平均改善高达0.85％，同时可减少高达9.5倍的平均可训练参数。在运行时间方面，与类似的PEFT备选方案相比，AFLoRA可以提供高达1.86倍的改进。除了我们方法的实际效用之外，我们还提供了关于训练",
