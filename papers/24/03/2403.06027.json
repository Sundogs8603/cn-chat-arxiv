    "translated_abstract": "这项研究展示了我们团队（BEEGees）在2023年George B. Moody PhysioNet挑战赛中的贡献。旨在利用临床数据和诸如多通道脑电图（EEG）和心电图（ECG）信号之类的时间序列数据，预测心脏骤停后昏迷患者的神经恢复。我们的建模方法是多模态的，基于从众多脑电图通道派生的二维频谱图表示，同时整合临床数据和直接从脑电图记录中提取的特征。我们提交的模型在自发循环恢复后72小时进行的预测的隐藏测试集上取得了0.53的挑战分数。我们的研究展示了在医学分类中使用迁移学习的有效性和局限性。关于未来的实施，我们的分析揭示了模型性能与决策阈值的选择密切相关，并在数据分割方面表现出明显的变异性。",
