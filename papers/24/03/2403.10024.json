To mitigate this, we propose MR-MT3, with enhancements including a memory retention mechanism, prior token sampling, and token shuffling are proposed.

    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文介绍了MT3模型的改进，MT3是一种最先进的基于令牌的多乐器自动音乐转录模型。尽管MT3性能最先进，但存在乐器泄漏问题，即转录在不同乐器之间片段化。为了减少这种问题，我们提出了MR-MT3，其中包括存储保留机制、先前令牌采样和令牌混洗等增强方法。这些方法在Slakh2100数据集上进行了评估，展示了改进的起始F1分数和减少的乐器泄漏。除了传统的多乐器转录F1分数，还引入了诸如乐器泄漏比率和乐器检测F1分数等新指标，以更全面地评估转录质量。该研究还探讨了通过在单乐器单声道数据集（如ComMU和NSynth）上评估MT3来评估域过度拟合的问题。",
