    "translated_abstract": "完全可观察的非确定性（FOND）规划是人工智能计划中不确定性的核心。它通过具有非确定性效果的动作来建模不确定性。AND*（Messa和Pereira，2023）是一个泛化了A* (Hart等人，1968) 用于FOND规划的FOND规划器。 本文研究并改进了AND*执行的政策空间搜索的性能。我们提出了一个多项式时间过程，仅给定应映射的状态集即可构造出解决方案政策。 这个过程，与对FOND政策结构的更好理解结合在一起，使我们能够提出三个政策之间的等价性概念。 我们使用政策等价性来修剪政策搜索空间的一部分，使AND*在解决FOND任务时更加有效。",
