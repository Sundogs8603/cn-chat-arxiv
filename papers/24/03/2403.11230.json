    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了利用深度学习技术分析肺部计算机断层扫描（CT）图像的方法。传统的深度学习方法在处理CT图像中的不同切片计数和分辨率方面面临挑战，这种差异来自于使用各种扫描设备。通常情况下，对单个切片进行预测，然后将其组合以获得全面的结果。然而，这种方法并没有包含特定于每个切片的学习特征，导致效果上的妥协。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种专门为CT扫描定制的高级空间切片特征学习（SSFL++）框架。它旨在过滤出整个CT扫描中的异常数据，通过减少70%的数据冗余，使我们能够选择进行分析的关键空间切片特征。此外，我们引入了一种基于核密度的切片采样（KDS）方法，以增强训练稳定性。",
