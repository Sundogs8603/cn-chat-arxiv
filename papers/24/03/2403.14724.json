    "translated_title": "隐私的六个层次：金融合成数据的框架",
    "translated_abstract": "合成数据在金融应用中变得越来越重要。除了它提供的好处，如改进金融建模和更好的测试程序，它也存在着隐私风险。这些数据可能源自客户信息、商业信息或其他必须受到保护的专有来源。虽然生成合成数据的过程在一定程度上有助于掩盖原始数据，但很难评估隐私保护的程度。因此，我们引入了一组有用于分类合成数据生成方法和逐渐改进的保护措施的\"隐私层次\"的等级。尽管这六个级别是在金融应用的背景下设计的，但它们在其他行业中也可能适用。我们的论文包括：对金融合成数据的简要概述，它如何被使用，如何评估其价值，隐私风险等。",
    "tldr": "该论文介绍了一种用于金融合成数据的“隐私层次”层级，有助于评估隐私保护程度和分类生成方法。"
