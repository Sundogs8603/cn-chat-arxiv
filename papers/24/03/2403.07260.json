    "translated_abstract": "对话中的情感识别(ERC)是一项任务，它在对话的上下文中预测话语的情感。它高度依赖于对话语境、说话者身份信息、多方对话场景等。然而，当前最先进的方法（instructERC）仅仅识别说话者，忽略了在对话过程中说话者背后的常识知识(即，听众的反应和说话者的意图等)，这些知识可以深入挖掘说话者信息。为此，我们提出了一种新颖的基于常识知识的大型语言模型联合情感识别对话框架，即CKERC。我们设计提示来生成基于历史话语的对话者常识，结合大型语言模型的互动者常识识别任务进行LLM预训练，以微调说话者隐含线索信息。通过解决以上挑战，我们的方法取得了最先进的成果。",
