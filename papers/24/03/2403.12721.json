The collection of these corpora comprises a total of 13 billion tokens of texts from 26 million documents. The comparability of the corpora is ensured by a comparable crawling setup and the usage of identical crawling and post-processing technology. All the corpora were linguistically annotated with the state-of-the-art CLASSLA-Stanza linguistic processing pipeline, and enriched with document-level genre information via the Transformer-based multilingual X-GENRE classifier, which further enhances comparability at the level of linguistic annotation and metadata enrichment. The genre-focused analysis of the resulting corpora shows a rather consistent distribution of genres throughout the seven corpora,",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一个涵盖斯洛文尼亚语、克罗地亚语、波斯尼亚语、黑山语、塞尔维亚语、马其顿语和保加利亚语高度可比较的网络语料库集合，从而覆盖了南斯拉夫语言空间所有官方语言的整个范围。这些语料库的总量为26亿个单词，来自2600万篇文档。语料库的可比较性由可比较的爬网设置和相同的爬网和后处理技术来确保。所有语料库都经过了最先进的CLASSLA-Stanza语言处理管道进行语言标注，并通过基于Transformer的多语种X-GENRE分类器增加了文档级别的文体信息，从而在语言标注和元数据丰富化的水平上进一步增强了可比较性。对结果语料库的文体聚焦分析显示了这七个语料库中各种文体的相当一致分布。",
