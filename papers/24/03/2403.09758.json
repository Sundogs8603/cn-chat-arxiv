However, in clinical settings, the available data are often quite limited. For instance, Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) is a noninvasive clinical tool that is commonly used in the clinical settings to measure blood velocity waveform at several locations on brain's vasculature. This amount of data is grossly insufficient for training machine learning surrogate models, such as deep neural networks or Gaussian process regression. In this work, we propose a Gaussian process regression approach based on physics-informed kernels, enabling near-real-time reconstruction of blood flow in data-poor regimes. We introduce a novel methodology to reconstruct the kernel within the vascular network, which is a non-Euclidean space.
