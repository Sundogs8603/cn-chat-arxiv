In the context of governmental decision making about individuals, contestability is often constitutionally required as an element of due process; specific procedures may be required by state or federal law relevant to a particular program. In addition, contestability can be a valuable way to discover systemic errors, contributing to ongoing assessments and system improvement.   On January 24-25, 2024, with support from the National Science Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, we convened a diverse group of government officials, representatives of leading technology companies, technology and policy experts from academia and the non-profit sector, advocates, and stakeholders for a workshop on advanced automated decision making, contestability, and the law.

    "translated_abstract": "Contestability——即有效挑战决定的能力——对于公平实施至关重要。在关于个人的政府决策背景下，竞争性往往作为正当程序的要素受宪法要求；特定程序可能会被州或联邦法律要求的相关特定计划。此外，竞争性也可以成为发现系统性错误的宝贵方式，有助于持续评估和系统改进。2024年1月24-25日，在国家科学基金会和威廉和弗洛拉·休利特基金会的支持下，我们召集了一群多样化的政府官员、领先科技公司的代表、学术界和非营利部门的技术和政策专家、倡导者和利益相关者，就先进自动化决策、竞争性和法律举办了一个研讨会。",
