By using the input image as guidance, we can leverage a pretrained diffusion generative model to solve a wide range of image inverse tasks without task specific model fine-tuning. To precisely estimate the guidance score function of the input image, we propose Diffusion Policy Gradient (DPG), a tractable computation method by viewing the intermediate noisy images as policies and the target image as the states selected by the policy. Experiments show that our method is robust to both Gaussian and Poisson noise degradation on multiple linear and non-linear inverse tasks, resulting into a higher image restoration quality on FFHQ, ImageNet and LSUN datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "解决图像逆问题（例如，超分辨率和修复）需要生成一个与给定输入（低分辨率图像或遮挡图像）相匹配的高保真图像。通过使用输入图像作为指导，我们可以利用预训练的扩散生成模型来解决各种图像逆任务，而无需针对特定任务微调模型。为了精确估计输入图像的指导评分函数，我们提出了扩散策略梯度（DPG），这是一种可行的计算方法，通过将中间噪声图像视为策略，将目标图像视为策略选择的状态。实验表明，我们的方法对多个线性和非线性逆任务上的高斯和泊松噪声退化都具有鲁棒性，从而在FFHQ、ImageNet和LSUN数据集上实现更高的图像恢复质量。",
