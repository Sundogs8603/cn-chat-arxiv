    "translated_abstract": "非负矩阵分解（NMF）是一种有效的数据表示工具，在信号处理和机器学习等领域有着众多应用。然而，在自组网络中分布式部署NMF会引入隐私问题，因为传统方法涉及在网络代理之间共享原始数据。为了解决这一问题，我们提出了一种隐私保护算法，用于全分布式NMF，将分布式大数据矩阵分解为左右矩阵因子，同时保护每个代理的本地数据隐私。它促进了代理之间左矩阵因子的协作估计，并使它们能够估计各自的右因子而不暴露原始数据。为了确保数据隐私，我们利用Paillier密码系统在相邻代理之间安全地进行信息交换，这是一种用于公钥加密的概率性非对称算法，允许对加密数据进行计算而不解密。",
