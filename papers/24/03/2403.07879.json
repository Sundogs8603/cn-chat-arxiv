I take up the example of an AI incident from September 2020, when a Twitter user created a 'horrible experiment' to demonstrate the racist bias of Twitter's algorithm for cropping images. This resulted in Twitter not only abandoning its use of that algorithm, but also disavowing its decision to use any algorithm for the task.

    "translated_abstract": "在人们普遍关注公众如何参与AI设计的背景下，我主张一个专注于AI事件的研究议程 - 即AI出错并引发争议的示例 - 以及它们在在线环境中如何构建的研究议程。我以2020年9月的一个AI事件为例，当时一个Twitter用户创建了一个“可怕的实验”来展示Twitter算法在裁剪图像时存在的种族偏见。这导致Twitter不仅放弃了该算法的使用，还否认了使用任何算法进行该任务的决定。我认为像这样的AI事件是参与需要进一步研究的AI系统的重要手段。我认为，这项研究议程应集中于如何通过我称之为“网络故障”的网络化在线行为来构建事件，其中参与的格式使个人和算法以各种方式进行交互。",
