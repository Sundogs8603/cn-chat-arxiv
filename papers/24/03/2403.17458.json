Our results show that no one solution is the best, but is dependent on external variables such as the types of attacks, complexity, and network environment in the dataset. For example, BoT_IoT and Stratosphere IoT datasets both capture IoT-related attacks, but the deep neural network performed the best when tested using the BoT_IoT dataset while HELAD performed the best when tested using the Stratosphere IoT dataset. So although we found that a deep neural network solution had the highest average F1 scores on tested datasets, it is not always the best-performing one. We further discuss difficulties in using IDS from literature and project repositories, which complicated drawing definitive conclusions regarding IDS selection.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们的论文通过实证比较最近的入侵检测系统，为用户提供客观比较，以帮助用户根据其需求选择最适合的解决方案。我们的结果显示，没有一种解决方案是最好的，而是取决于外部变量，如攻击类型、复杂性和数据集中的网络环境。例如，BoT_IoT和Stratosphere IoT数据集都捕获了与物联网相关的攻击，但深度神经网络在使用BoT_IoT数据集进行测试时表现最佳，而在使用Stratosphere IoT数据集进行测试时HELAD表现最佳。因此，尽管我们发现深度神经网络解决方案在测试数据集上具有最高的平均F1分数，但并不总是表现最好的。我们进一步讨论了使用文献和项目存储库中的IDS的困难，这使得就IDS选择得出明确结论变得复杂。",
