    "translated_abstract": "虽然位置轨迹代表着供各种分析和基于位置的服务的宝贵数据来源，但它们可能泄漏敏感信息，如政治和宗教偏好。已经提出了不同ially private发布机制，允许在严格的隐私保证下进行分析。然而，传统的保护方案存在隐私和实用性的权衡限制，并容易受到相关性和重构攻击的威胁。合成轨迹数据生成和发布代表了保护算法的一个具有前景的替代方案。虽然最初的提议取得了显著的实用性，但未能提供严格的隐私保证。本文提出了一个框架，通过定义五个设计目标，特别强调选择适当的隐私单位的重要性，来设计一个保护隐私的轨迹发布方法。基于这一框架，我们简要讨论了现有的轨迹发布方法。",
