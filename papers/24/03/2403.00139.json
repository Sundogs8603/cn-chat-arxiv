Among our results, a semi-analytical solution for the optimizer is found through variational methods for exponential, power/logarithmic, and quadratic utility.

    "translated_abstract": "本文分析了在不完全市场中使用衍生成为静态对冲的最优问题。投资者被假设对两个基础资产有风险敞口。对冲工具为写在单个基础资产上的普通期权。对冲问题被规定为一个效用最大化问题，通过该问题确定最优静态对冲的形式。在我们的结果中，通过指数、幂/对数和二次效用的变分方法找到了最优解的半解析解。当每个基础资产都有普通期权可用时，最优解与Lipschitz映射的不动点相关联。在指数效用的情况下，只有一个这样的不动点，并且映射的后续迭代收敛于它。",
