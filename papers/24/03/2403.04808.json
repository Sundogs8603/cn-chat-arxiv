This paper proposes a novel watermarking scheme, so-called WaterMax, that enjoys high detectability while sustaining the quality of the generated text of the original LLM. Its new design leaves the LLM untouched (no modification of the weights, logits, temperature, or sampling technique). WaterMax balances robustness and complexity contrary to the watermarking techniques of the literature inherently provoking a trade-off between quality and robustness. Its performance is both theoretically proven and experimentally validated. It outperforms all the SotA techniques under the most complete benchmark suite.",

    "translated_abstract": "水印是阻止大型语言模型被恶意使用的技术手段。本文提出了一种称为WaterMax的新颖水印方案，具有高检测性能，同时保持原始LLM生成文本的质量。其新设计不会对LLM进行任何修改（不调整权重、对数、温度或采样技术）。WaterMax平衡了稳健性和复杂性，与文献中的水印技术相反，从根本上引发了质量和稳健性之间的平衡。其性能在理论上得到证明并经过实验证实。在最全面的基准测试套件下，它胜过所有的最先进技术。",
