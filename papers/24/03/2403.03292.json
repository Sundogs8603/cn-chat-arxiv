However, in practical scenarios, the data distribution across the agents can have significant heterogeneity. In this work, we propose averaging rate scheduling as a simple yet effective way to reduce the impact of heterogeneity in decentralized learning. Our experiments illustrate the superiority of the proposed method (~3% improvement in test accuracy) compared to the conventional approach of employing a constant averaging rate.",

    "translated_abstract": "最先进的分散式学习算法通常要求数据分布是独立同分布（IID）的。然而，在实际场景中，代理之间的数据分布可能存在显著的异构性。在这项工作中，我们提出了平均化速率调度作为一种简单而有效的方法，以减少分散式学习中异构性的影响。我们的实验表明，与采用恒定平均化速率的传统方法相比，所提出的方法在测试准确性上表现优越（提高了约3%）。",
