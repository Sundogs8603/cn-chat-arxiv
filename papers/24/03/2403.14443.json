The paradox is that buyers need to access information to determine its value, while sellers need to limit access to prevent theft. To study this, we introduce an open-source simulated digital marketplace where intelligent agents, powered by language models, buy and sell information on behalf of external participants. The central mechanism enabling this marketplace is the agents' dual capabilities: they not only have the capacity to assess the quality of privileged information but also come equipped with the ability to forget. This ability to induce amnesia allows vendors to grant temporary access to proprietary information, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized retention while enabling agents to accurately gauge the information's relevance to specific queries or tasks.

    "translated_abstract": "这项工作解决了信息市场中买方检查悖论的问题。买方需要获取信息来确定其价值，而卖方需要限制访问以防止盗窃。为了研究这一问题，我们引入一个开源的模拟数字市场，其中由语言模型驱动的智能代理代表外部参与者买卖信息。这个市场的核心机制在于代理人的双重能力：他们不仅能够评估特权信息的质量，还具备遗忘的能力。这种诱导健忘的能力使供应商可以授予临时访问专有信息的权限，显著降低未经授权的保留风险，同时使代理人能够准确评估信息对特定查询或任务的相关性。为了表现优异，代理必须做出理性决策，战略性地探索市场。",
