    "translated_abstract": "射电干涉成像需要解决来自大数据量的高分辨率高动态范围逆问题。最近基于优化理论的图像重建技术展示了惊人的成像精度能力，远远超出了CLEAN的能力。这些方法包括由手工设计的正则化算子推动的先进近端算法，如SARA系列，以及由学习正则化去噪器推动的混合插拔（PnP）算法，如AIRI。然而，优化和PnP结构高度迭代，这阻碍了它们处理未来仪器预期的极端数据大小的能力。为解决这一可扩展性挑战，我们引入一种新颖的深度学习方法，命名为“用于高动态范围成像的残差对残差DNN系列”。R2D2的重建被形成为一系列残差图像，这些图像作为深度神经网络的输出，通过迭代估计而得到。",
