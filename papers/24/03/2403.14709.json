    "translated_abstract": "本研究论文通过分析向ClimateQ&A平台提出的问题，调查了公众对气候变化和生物多样性丧失的看法。ClimateQ&A是一个会话代理，利用LLMs来回应基于来自IPCC和IPBES报告的超过14,000页科学文献的查询。该工具于2023年3月上线，已搜集了来自法国受众主要提出的超过30,000个问题。其聊天机器人界面允许自由提出与自然相关的问题*. 尽管其主要目标是使自然科学更易接近，但它也允许收集和分析问题及其主题。与涉及封闭问题的传统调查不同，这种新颖方法为个体关于自然的质询提供了新的视角。在对3,425个问题的样本运行NLP聚类算法后，我们发现有显著的25.8%的问题询问气候变化和生物多样性丧失将如何影响环境。",
