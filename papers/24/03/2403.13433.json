    "translated_abstract": "为了探讨语言在人类集体行为中的作用，我们开发了代理人群组聊天模拟，模拟多代理之间在不同设置下的语言交互。代理人被要求在该模拟中自由聊天，基于其角色设定追求各自的目的，旨在观察代理人展现出既意料不到又显著的新兴行为。将四个叙事场景（继承争议、法庭辩论、哲学辞说、电影角色争议）整合到代理人群组聊天中，以评估其支持多样化故事情节的能力。通过在代理人群组聊天中配置特定的环境设置，我们能够评估代理人是否展现出与人类期望一致的行为。我们通过计算角色发言的所有内容的n-gram Shannon熵来评估环境中的混乱程度。我们的研究结果显示，在代理人具有子...",
