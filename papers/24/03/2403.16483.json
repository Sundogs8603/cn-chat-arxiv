    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.16483v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Geoparsing is the task of estimating the latitude and longitude (coordinates) of location expressions in texts. Geoparsing must deal with the ambiguity of the expressions that indicate multiple locations with the same notation. For evaluating geoparsing systems, several corpora have been proposed in previous work. However, these corpora are small-scale and suffer from the coverage of location expressions on general domains. In this paper, we propose Wikipedia Hyperlink-based Location Linking (WHLL), a novel method to construct a large-scale corpus for geoparsing from Wikipedia articles. WHLL leverages hyperlinks in Wikipedia to annotate multiple location expressions with coordinates. With this method, we constructed the WHLL corpus, a new large-scale corpus for geoparsing. The WHLL corpus consists of 1.3M articles, each containing about 7.8 unique location expressions. 45.6% of location expressions are ambiguous and refer to more than on",

    "translated_abstract": "地理解析是对文本中的位置表达进行经纬度（坐标）估计的任务。地理解析必须处理指示具有相同符号的多个位置的表达的歧义。为了评估地理解析系统，先前的研究提出了几个语料库。然而，这些语料库规模较小，并且受限于一般领域的位置表达覆盖。本文提出了基于维基百科超链接的位置链接（WHLL）方法，这是一种构建用于地理解析的大规模语料库的新方法。WHLL利用维基百科中的超链接来用坐标注释多个位置表达。通过这种方法，我们构建了WHLL语料库，这是一个新的用于地理解析的大规模语料库。WHLL语料库包含130万篇文章，每篇约包含7.8个独特的位置表达。45.6%的位置表达存在歧义，并指示多个地点。",
