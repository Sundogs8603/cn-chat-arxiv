The joint process for the economic state and the rating is modelled as a time-homogeneous Markov chain. While the rating process itself possesses the Markov property only under restrictive conditions, methods from Markov theory can be used to derive the rating process' asymptotic behaviour. We use the mathematical framework to formalise and analyse different rating philosophies, such as point-in-time (PIT) and through-the-cycle (TTC) ratings. Furthermore, we introduce stochastic orders on the bivariate process' transition matrix to establish a consistent notion of \"better\" and \"worse\" ratings. Finally, the construction of PIT and TTC ratings is illustrated on a Merton-type firm-value process.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个信用评级迁移模型，考虑了经济状态波动对违约概率的影响。经济状态和评级的联合过程被建模为一个时间齐次的马尔可夫链。虽然评级过程本身只有在限制条件下具有马尔可夫性质，但可以使用马尔可夫理论中的方法来推导评级过程的渐近行为。我们利用数学框架来形式化和分析不同的评级哲学，如时点评级（PIT）和整个周期评级（TTC）。此外，我们引入了双变量过程的转移矩阵上的随机次序，以确立“更好”和“更差”评级的一致概念。最后，我们在一个Merton类型的公司价值过程上说明了PIT和TTC评级的构建。",
