    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文研究了解释性人工智能（XAI）在使用机器学习（ML）设计嵌入式系统中的应用。作为一个案例研究，它解决了静态静默存储预测的挑战性问题。这涉及仅基于静态程序特征识别冗余内存写入。消除这种存储会通过减少内存访问和总线流量提高性能和能效，尤其是在新兴非易失性内存技术存在的情况下。为了实现这一目标，我们提出了一个方法，包括：1）为解释静默存储预测开发相关的ML模型，以及2）应用XAI来解释这些模型。我们采用两种最先进的模型无关的XAI方法来分析静默存储的原因。通过案例研究，我们评估了这些方法的有效性。我们发现这些方法为静默存储预测提供了解释，",
