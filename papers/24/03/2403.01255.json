    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.01255v1 公告类型：跨领域 摘要：深度学习（DL）的最新进展对自动语音识别（ASR）构成了重大挑战。ASR依赖于包括机密数据在内的大量训练数据，并需要大量的计算和存储资源。启用自适应系统可以提高动态环境下的ASR性能。DL技术假设训练和测试数据来自同一领域，但并非总是如此。深度迁移学习（DTL）、联邦学习（FL）和强化学习（RL）等先进的DL技术解决了这些问题。DTL可以利用小而相关的数据集构建高性能模型，FL使得在不拥有数据集的情况下训练模型，RL优化动态环境下的决策，降低计算成本。本调查全面审阅了基于DTL、FL和RL的ASR框架，旨在提供对最新发展的见解，并协助研究人员。",
