We compared models like Deep Learning, Generalized Linear Models, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Naive Bayes. GBM stood out with an F1-score of 84.3% and accuracy of 82.2%, accurately predicting readmissions across demographics. A fairness analysis was conducted across all the models. GBM minimized disparities in predictions, achieving balanced results across genders and races. It showed low False Discovery Rates (FDR) (6-7%) and False Positive Rates (FPR) (5%) for both genders. Additionally, FDRs remained low for racial groups, such as African Americans (8%) and Asians (7%). Similarly, FPRs were consistent across age groups (4%) for both patients under 40 and those above 40, indicating its precision and ability to reduce bias. These findings empha",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在调查机器学习（ML）模型如何能够公平、准确地预测糖尿病患者的再入院情况，跨不同人口统计学因素（年龄、性别、种族）。我们比较了 Deep Learning、广义线性模型、梯度上升机（GBM）和朴素贝叶斯等模型。GBM表现出色，具有 84.3% 的 F1 分数和 82.2% 的准确度，准确地预测了跨不同人口统计学因素的再入院情况。对所有模型进行了公平性分析。GBM最小化了预测中的差异，在性别和种族之间获得了平衡的结果。对于两性来说，它显示出较低的假阴性率（FDR）（6-7%）和假阳性率（FPR）（5%）。此外，对于种族群体，如非裔美国人（8%）和亚裔（7%），FDR保持较低水平。类似地，对于年龄群体（40 岁以下和40 岁以上患者），FPR在 4% 的水平上保持一致，表明其精确性和减少偏见的能力。这些发现强调了",
