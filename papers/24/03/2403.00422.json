In this setting, a treatment or policy will typically become an object of interest to the researcher when it is either selected from the estimated set of best-performers or arises from a data-dependent selection rule. In this paper, we develop new inference tools for interval-identified parameters chosen via these forms of selection. We develop three types of confidence intervals for data-dependent and interval-identified parameters, discuss how they apply to several examples of interest and prove their uniform asymptotic validity under weak assumptions.",

    "translated_abstract": "参数的区间识别，如平均处理效应、平均部分效应和福利，特别常见于使用观测数据和由于个体治疗被动摄入的内生性而导致的实验数据。在这种情况下，当研究者将一个治疗或政策从估计的最佳表现者集合中选取，或者它是从一种数据相关的选择规则中产生时，通常会成为研究对象。在本文中，我们为通过这些形式的选择选择的参数开发了新的推断工具。我们为数据相关和区间识别参数开发了三种置信区间，讨论了它们如何适用于几个感兴趣的示例，并证明了它们在弱假设下的一致渐近有效性。",
