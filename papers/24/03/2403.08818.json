    "translated_abstract": "电子健康记录（EHRs）在近几十年来越来越受欢迎，支持临床决策和医疗保健。EHRs通常包含异构信息，如表格形式的结构化数据和文本笔记中的非结构化数据。EHRs中的不同类型信息可以相互补充，提供患者健康状态的更完整图片。尽管对结构化EHR数据的表示学习进行了大量研究，但不同类型EHR数据的融合（多模态融合）尚未得到充分研究。这主要是由于医疗编码系统的复杂性和书面笔记中存在的噪音和冗余。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个名为MINGLE的新框架，有效地将EHR中的结构和语义结合起来。我们的框架使用两级注入策略将医学概念语义和临床笔记语义融合到超图中。",
