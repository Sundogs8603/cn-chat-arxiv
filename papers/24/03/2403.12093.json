    "translated_abstract": "有效的宏观经济政策在促进经济增长和社会稳定方面起着至关重要的作用。本文基于Stackelberg Mean Field Game（SMFG）模型，将最优宏观经济政策问题建模，其中政府作为政策制定的领导者，大规模家庭动态响应为追随者。这种建模方法捕捉了政府和大规模家庭之间的非对称动态博弈，并可以解释地评估基于微观基础的宏观经济政策效果，这是现有方法难以实现的。我们还提出了一种解决SMFG的方法，将真实数据进行预训练，并结合一种无模型的Stackelberg均场强化学习（SMFRL）算法，该算法可以独立于先前的环境知识和转变运行。我们的实验结果展示了SMFG方法在经济政策方面优于其他方法的优越性。",
