    "translated_abstract": "基础模型(FMs)作为一种有前途的解决方案出现，通过利用先前的知识来理解异构数据集中复杂的时间和空间相关性，从而利用分布式和多样化的环境数据。与联合学习等分布式学习框架不同，它们通常难以处理多模态数据，FMs可以将不同的输入转换为嵌入。这一过程有助于整合各种模态的信息，并将先前的学习应用于新的领域。然而，在资源受限的边缘系统中部署FMs会带来重大挑战。为此，我们引入了CoRAST，这是一个新颖的学习框架，利用FMs增强了分布式、相关的异构数据的分析。通过利用基于服务器的FM，CoRAST可以利用现有的环境信息来提取传感器数据之间的时间、空间和跨模态相关性。",
