In such a paradigm, humans are found to rarely trigger analytical thinking and face difficulties in communicating the nuances of conflicting opinions to the AI when disagreements occur. To tackle this challenge, we propose Human-AI Deliberation, a novel framework to promote human reflection and discussion on conflicting human-AI opinions in decision-making. Based on theories in human deliberation, this framework engages humans and AI in dimension-level opinion elicitation, deliberative discussion, and decision updates. To empower AI with deliberative capabilities, we designed Deliberative AI, which leverages large language models (LLMs) as a bridge between humans and domain-specific models to enable flexible conversational interactions and faithful information provision.

    "translated_abstract": "在人工智能辅助决策中，人类通常被动地审查人工智能的建议，然后决定是否全盘接受或拒绝。在这样的范式中，发现人类很少激发分析思维，且在发生分歧时难以将矛盾意见的细微差别传达给人工智能。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了人工智能和人类的辩论，这是一个新颖的框架，旨在促进人类在决策过程中对人工智能意见分歧进行反思和讨论。基于人类辩论理论，该框架通过维度级意见征集、辩论讨论和决策更新，将人类和人工智能进行互动。为了赋予人工智能辩论能力，我们设计了辩论人工智能，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）作为人类和领域特定模型之间的桥梁，实现灵活的对话交互和忠实的信息提供。",
