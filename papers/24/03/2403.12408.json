    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.12408v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: There have been emerging research interest and advances in speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), translating utterances from one language to another. This work proposes Multitask Speech Language Model (MSLM), which is a decoder-only speech language model trained in a multitask setting. Without reliance on text training data, our model is able to support multilingual S2ST with speaker style preserved.",
