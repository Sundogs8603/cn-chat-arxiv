Since these programs operate under resource constraints, they must decide who to prioritize. Typically, funding is distributed by a reactive or first-come-first serve allocation process that does not systematically consider risk of future homelessness. We partnered with Allegheny County, PA to explore a proactive allocation approach that prioritizes individuals facing eviction based on their risk of future homelessness. Our ML system that uses state and county administrative data to accurately identify individuals in need of support outperforms simpler prioritization approaches by at least 20% while being fair and equitable across race and gender. Furthermore, our approach would identify 28% of individuals who are overlooked by the current process and end up homeless. Beyond improvements ",

    "translated_abstract": "租金补助计划为个人提供财政援助，以防止由驱逐引起的住房不稳定并避免无家可归。由于这些计划在资源限制下运作，它们必须决定谁是优先考虑的对象。通常，资金是通过一种反应性或先到先得的分配过程分发的，这种过程不系统地考虑未来无家可归的风险。我们与宾夕法尼亚州阿勒格尼县合作，探索了一种积极的分配方法，根据他们未来无家可归的风险优先考虑面临驱逐的个人。我们的机器学习系统利用州和县的行政数据准确识别需要支持的个人，其表现优于至少20%的简单优先级处理方法，同时在种族和性别上公平公正。此外，我们的方法将识别出28%的个人，这些人被当前的处理流程所忽视并最终无家可归。除了改进",
