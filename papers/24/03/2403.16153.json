    "translated_abstract": "精确可靠的传感器测量对于确保风力涡轮等复杂工程系统的安全性和长期性至关重要。在本文中，我们提出了一种使用掩盖模型和自监督学习进行传感器故障检测、隔离和容错（FDIA）的新框架。我们提出的方法是一种通用的时间序列建模方法，可以应用于任何能够进行序列建模的神经网络（NN）模型，并捕捉不同传感器之间复杂的时空关系。在训练过程中，提出的掩盖方法创建随机掩码，它就像一个故障，针对一个或多个传感器，使训练和推断任务统一：找到有故障的传感器并进行纠正。我们在一个公共数据集和GE近海风力涡轮的真实数据集上验证了我们提出的技术，并展示了它在检测、诊断和纠正传感器故障方面的有效性。",
