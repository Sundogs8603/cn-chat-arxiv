The classical work of Roth and Vande Vate (1990) suggests simple decentralized dynamics in which randomly-chosen blocking pairs match successively. Such decentralized interactions guarantee convergence to a stable matching. Our first theorem shows that, under mild conditions, any unstable matching -- including a small perturbation of a stable matching -- can culminate in any stable matching through these dynamics. Our second theorem highlights another aspect of fragility: stabilization may take a long time. Even in markets with a unique stable matching, where the dynamics always converge to the same matching, decentralized interactions can require an exponentially long duration to converge. A small perturbation of a stable matching may lead the market away from stability and involve a sizable proportion of mismatched participants for extended periods",

    "translated_abstract": "我们展示了在去中心化的一对一匹配环境中易碎的稳定匹配。Roth and Vande Vate (1990)的经典工作表明了简单的去中心化动态，其中随机选择的阻塞对依次匹配。这种去中心化交互保证收敛到一个稳定匹配。我们的第一个定理表明，在温和条件下，任何不稳定匹配 -- 包括对稳定匹配的微小扰动 -- 都可以通过这些动态最终转化为任何稳定匹配。我们的第二个定理突出了易碎性的另一个方面：稳定化可能需要很长时间。即使在具有唯一稳定匹配的市场中，动态总是收敛于相同的匹配，去中心化交互也可能需要指数长的时间才能收敛。对稳定匹配的微小扰动可能会让市场远离稳定，并涉及相当比例的不匹配参与者长时间参与。",
