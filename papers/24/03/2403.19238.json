    "translated_abstract": "高清屏幕在端设备(如终端用户相机、智能手机和电视)上的广泛应用推动了图像增强需求的显着增长。现有的增强模型通常在优化高性能方面表现出色，但在减少硬件推断时间和功耗方面存在不足，特别是对于计算和存储资源受限的端设备而言。为此，我们提出了一种图像颜色增强查找表(ICELUT)方法，该方法采用查找表进行极其高效的边缘推断，而无需使用卷积神经网络(CNN)。在训练过程中，我们利用逐点(1x1)卷积来提取颜色信息，同时使用分割全连接层来融入全局信息。然后，这两个组件都无缝转换为查找表，以便进行硬件无关的部署。ICELUT实现了接近最先进的性能，同时功耗极低。",
