    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.15615v1 公告类型: 新的 摘要: 对话是社会、认知和计算科学越来越感兴趣的主题。然而，随着对话数据集的规模和复杂性不断增加，研究人员缺乏可伸缩的方法将语音转录转换为会话轮次——社会互动的基本构建模块。我们介绍了“NaturalTurn”，一种旨在准确捕捉自然交流动态的轮次分割算法。NaturalTurn通过区分说话者的主要对话轮次和听众的次要话语，如背景声、简短插话和其他表现对话特征的平行言语形式，来运作。使用大型对话语料库的数据，我们展示了与现有方法派生的转录相比，NaturalTurn派生的转录表现出有利的统计和推断特性。NaturalTurn算法代表了一种改进。",
