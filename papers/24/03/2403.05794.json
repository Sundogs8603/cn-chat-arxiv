    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们介绍了一种利用同态加密的隐私保护稳定扩散框架，称为HE-Diffusion，主要关注于保护扩散过程中的去噪阶段。HE-Diffusion是一个量身定制的加密框架，专门设计以与稳定扩散的独特架构相匹配，确保隐私和功能性。为了解决固有的计算挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的最小失真方法，使得部分图像加密更加高效，显著降低了开销而不损害模型的输出质量。此外，我们采用了稀疏张量表示来加速计算操作，提高了隐私保护扩散过程的整体效率。我们成功实现了基于HE的隐私保护稳定扩散推理。实验结果表明，HE-Diffusion相比之下实现了500倍的加速。",
