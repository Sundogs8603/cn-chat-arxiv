We conduct a survey of existing 'readiness' assessments both for general digital adoption and for AI policy in particular. We conclude that existing global readiness assessments do not fully capture African states' progress in AI readiness and lay the groundwork for how assessments can be better used for the African context. We consider the extent to which these indicators map to the African context and what these indicators miss in capturing African states' on-the-ground work in meeting AI capability. Through case studies of four African nations of diverse geographic and economic dimensions, we identify nuances missed by global assessments and offer high-level policy considerations for how states can best improve their AI readiness standards and prepare their societies to capture the benefits of AI.",

    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.14662v1 公告类型：跨领域 摘要：人工智能（AI）需要新的评估方式，以评估非洲国家在国家技术使用和战略方面的准备情况。我们对现有的针对一般数字采纳和特定AI政策的“准备情况”评估进行了调查。我们得出结论，现有的全球准备情况评估并没有完全捕捉到非洲国家在AI准备方面的进步，并为如何更好地利用这些评估来适应非洲背景奠定了基础。我们考虑这些指标在多大程度上与非洲背景相吻合，以及这些指标在捕捉非洲国家在实现AI能力方面的实际工作方面所遗漏的内容。通过对非洲四个地理和经济尺度不同的国家进行案例研究，我们提出了全球评估遗漏的细微差别，并提供了如何改善国家的AI准备标准以及如何使社会能够获益于AI的高层政策考虑。",
