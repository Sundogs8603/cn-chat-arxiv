Model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) presents a promising avenue in this direction, but learning DRL control policies that generalize to multiple traffic scenarios is still a challenge. To address this, we introduce Multi-residual Task Learning (MRTL), a generic learning framework based on multi-task learning that, for a set of task scenarios, decomposes the control into nominal components that are effectively solved by conventional control methods and residual terms which are solved using learning.

    "translated_abstract": "传统控制，如基于模型的控制，在自动驾驶中通常被使用，因为其效率和可靠性。然而，现实世界中的自动驾驶要应对各种具有挑战性的不同交通场景，这对这些规划算法是具有挑战性的。基于模型无关的深度强化学习（DRL）在这方面提供了一个有前景的途径，但学习DRL控制策略以泛化到多个交通场景仍然是一个挑战。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一种名为多残差任务学习（MRTL）的通用学习框架，它是基于多任务学习的，针对一组任务场景，将控制分解为有效由传统控制方法解决的名义分量和由学习解决的残差项。我们使用MRTL来在混合交通中通过使用自动驾驶车辆来实现车队级别的排放减少作为系统控制手段。通过分析MR性能",
