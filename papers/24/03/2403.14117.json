    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.14117v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: In our era of rapid technological advancement, the research landscape for writing assistants has become increasingly fragmented across various research communities. We seek to address this challenge by proposing a design space as a structured way to examine and explore the multidimensional space of intelligent and interactive writing assistants. Through a large community collaboration, we explore five aspects of writing assistants: task, user, technology, interaction, and ecosystem. Within each aspect, we define dimensions (i.e., fundamental components of an aspect) and codes (i.e., potential options for each dimension) by systematically reviewing 115 papers. Our design space aims to offer researchers and designers a practical tool to navigate, comprehend, and compare the various possibilities of writing assistants, and aid in the envisioning and design of new writing assistants.",

    "translated_abstract": "在我们这个快速科技发展的时代，写作助手的研究领域已经在各个研究社区中变得日益分散。我们通过提出一种设计空间来解决这一挑战，作为一种结构化的方法来检验和探索智能交互式写作助手的多维空间。通过大型社区协作，我们探讨了写作助手的五个方面：任务、用户、技术、交互和生态系统。在每个方面，我们通过系统审阅115篇论文定义了维度（即方面的基本组成部分）和代码（即每个维度的可能选项）。我们的设计空间旨在为研究人员和设计师提供一个实用工具，帮助他们导航、理解和比较写作助手的各种可能性，并帮助构思和设计新的写作助手。",
