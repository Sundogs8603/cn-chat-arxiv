    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.10441v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We consider both $N$-player and mean-field games of optimal portfolio liquidation in which the players are not allowed to change the direction of trading. Players with an initially short position of stocks are only allowed to buy while players with an initially long position are only allowed to sell the stock. Under suitable conditions on the model parameters we show that the games are equivalent to games of timing where the players need to determine the optimal times of market entry and exit. We identify the equilibrium entry and exit times and prove that equilibrium mean-trading rates can be characterized in terms of the solutions to a highly non-linear higher-order integral equation with endogenous terminal condition. We prove the existence of a unique solution to the integral equation from which we obtain the existence of a unique equilibrium both in the mean-field and the $N$-player game.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了涉及$N$个玩家的最优投资组合清算的博弈和均场博弈，在这些博弈中，玩家不被允许改变交易方向。初始空头头寸的玩家只能买入，而初始多头头寸的玩家只能卖出股票。在模型参数合适的条件下，我们证明了这些博弈等价于需要确定最佳市场准入和退出时间的定时博弈。我们确定了均衡的准入和退出时间，并证明了均衡的交易率可以通过以端点条件为内生条件的高度非线性高阶积分方程的解来表征。我们证明了积分方程存在唯一解，由此我们得出了均场和$N$个玩家博弈中均衡存在且唯一的结论。",
