With the advent of extensive mobile network coverage, we can leverage mobile user activities, or cellular traffic, on roadways as a proxy for vehicle flow.

    "translated_abstract": "车辆流量是交通运输的重要指标，通常受检测器覆盖范围限制。随着广泛的移动网络覆盖的出现，我们可以利用道路上的移动用户活动或蜂窝流量作为车辆流量的代理。然而，由于来自各种用户类型的数据，蜂窝流量的计数可能与车辆流量不完全一致，因此我们提出了一个新任务：使用蜂窝流量预测无摄像头区域的车辆流量。为了揭示多源数据中的相关性，我们在选定的道路上部署摄像机建立了Tel2Veh数据集，其中包含大量的蜂窝流量和稀疏的车辆流量。针对这一挑战，我们提出了一个框架，独立提取特征并将其与基于图神经网络（GNN）的融合相结合，以识别差异，从而利用蜂窝流量预测未见车辆流量。这项工作推动了电信数据的使用。",
