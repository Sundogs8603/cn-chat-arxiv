    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了深度学习推荐模型的扁平架构、常见的分布式训练模式和分层数据中心拓扑之间的不匹配。为了解决相关的低效性，我们提出了Disaggregated Multi-Tower（DMT），这是一种建模技术，包括（1）语义保留的Tower Transform（SPTT），一个将单片全局嵌入查找过程分解为不相交塔以利用数据中心位置关系的新型训练模式；（2）Tower Module（TM），一个附加到每个塔的协同稠密组件，通过分层特征交互降低模型复杂性和通信量；和（3）Tower Partitioner（TP），一个特征分区器，系统地创建具有有意义特征交互和负载平衡分配的塔，通过学习的嵌入来保持模型质量和训练吞吐量。我们展示了DMT相比于最新的方法可以实现高达1.9倍的加速。",
