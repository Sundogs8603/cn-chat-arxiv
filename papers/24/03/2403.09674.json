    "translated_abstract": "在人工智能与医学研究交织的时代，真相的披露变得日益复杂。本研究表面上审查了一种所谓的新型SARS-CoV-2变种，被称为Ω变种，展示在S基因区域中有31个独特突变。然而，这个故事的真正潜台词是展示了AI（具体来说是ChatGPT-4）可以如何轻松地制造令人信服但完全虚构的科学数据。所谓的Ω变种在一个完全接种疫苗、之前感染过的35岁男性中被鉴定出现严重COVID-19症状。通过详细的，尽管是虚拟的，基因组分析和接触者追踪，本研究模拟了真实病例报告的严谨方法，从而为一个引人入胜但完全构造的叙述奠定了基础。整个病例研究是由OpenAI的大型语言模型ChatGPT-4生成的Ω变种。",
