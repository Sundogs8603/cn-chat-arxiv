    "translated_abstract": "深度学习（DL）通过解决各种自然语言处理（NLP）任务，极大地增强了医疗保健研究。然而，基于DL的NLP方法日益复杂，需要透明的模型解释性，或至少是可解释性，以进行可靠的决策制定。本文对医疗健康NLP中的可解释和可解释的DL进行了彻底的范围审查。引入了术语“XIAI”（eXplainable和Interpretable Artificial Intelligence）以区分XAI和IAI。方法根据其功能（模型、输入、输出为基础）和范围（局部、全局）进一步分类。我们的分析表明，注意机制是最主要的新兴IAI。此外，IAI越来越多地用于对抗XAI。确定的主要挑战是大多数XIAI不探索“全局”建模过程，缺乏最佳实践，并且需要系统评估和基准测试。",
