    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了SNOW-SCA，这是第一个针对5G移动通信安全标准候选SNOW-V的侧信道分析（SCA）攻击，该标准在32位ARM Cortex-M4微控制器上运行。首先，我们进行了通用的已知密钥相关性（KKC）分析以识别泄漏点。接着，进行了相关功耗分析（CPA）攻击，将攻击复杂性降低到每个密钥字节两次密钥猜测。然后，利用线性判别分析（LDA）唯一确定正确的秘密密钥。通过使用带有LDA的配置文件化SCA攻击在训练$<200$跟踪后实现100%准确率，这意味着仅使用单个跟踪即可成功发动攻击。总的来说，使用\\textit{组合CPA和LDA攻击}模型，使用ChipWhisperer平台收集<50跟踪即可恢复SNOW-V的正确秘密密钥字节。使用所提出的SCA攻击，可以逐步恢复SNOW-V的整个256位秘密密钥。",
