We investigate current benchmarks to incorporate excessive visual content within textual questions, which potentially assist MLLMs in deducing answers without truly interpreting the input diagrams. To this end, we introduce MathVerse, an all-around visual math benchmark designed for an equitable and in-depth evaluation of MLLMs. We meticulously collect 2,612 high-quality, multi-subject math problems with diagrams from publicly available sources.

    "translated_abstract": "多模式大型语言模型（MLLMs）取得了显著进展，在视觉环境中表现出色，然而它们在视觉数学问题解决方面的能力仍未充分评估和理解。本研究调查了当前基准测试，将过多的视觉内容融入文本问题中，这有助于MLLM在不真正解释输入图表的情况下推导答案。为此，我们介绍了MathVerse，这是一个全方位的视觉数学基准测试，旨在公平而深入地评估MLLMs。我们精心收集了2,612个高质量的多学科数学问题，其中包含图表，来源于公开渠道。然后，每个问题由人工注释者转化为六个不同版本，每个版本在多模式中提供不同程度的信息内容，共贡献了15K个测试样本。这种方法使得MathVerse能够同时",
