    "translated_abstract": "当集中式服务器存在单点故障风险时，像区块链这样的去中心化方法通过在多个实体之间实施共识机制提供了一个引人注目的解决方案。将分布式计算与加密技术相结合，去中心化技术引入了一种新颖的计算范式。区块链通过在网络节点之间经过共识验证和记录交易来确保安全、透明和防篡改的数据管理。联邦学习（FL）作为一种分布式机器学习框架，使参与者能够在协同训练模型的同时通过避免直接原始数据交换来保护数据隐私。尽管对去中心化方法越来越感兴趣，但它们在FL中的应用仍然尚未得到充分探讨。本文深入调查了基于区块链的FL（BCFL），重点关注区块链的安全特性与FL的隐私保护模式之间的协同作用。",
