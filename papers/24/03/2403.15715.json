    "translated_abstract": "立场检测旨在确定文本对特定目标表达的态度。零样本立场检测（ZSSD）旨在在推理过程中对未见目标进行立场分类。最近针对ZSSD的数据增强技术通过文本或目标增强增加了在不同目标之间的可转移知识。然而，这些方法存在一定局限性。目标增强缺乏生成目标与源文本之间的逻辑关系，而文本增强仅依赖于训练数据，导致泛化能力不足。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种编码器-解码器数据增强（EDDA）框架。编码器利用大规模语言模型和思维链提示将文本总结为特定于目标的if-then原理，建立逻辑关系。解码器根据这些表达式使用语义相关的词替换策略生成新样本，增加了其同义性。",
