    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们为古典中文开发了一个历史心理文本分析流程。数千年来，人类用各种语言创作文本；然而，大多数计算文献都集中在当代语言和语料库上。历史心理学这一新兴领域依赖计算技术，利用自然语言处理（NLP）中开发的新方法，从历史语料库中提取心理学方面的内容。名为上下文化结构表征（CCR）的当前流程，结合了心理测量学（即心理调查）领域的专业知识和通过基于transformer的语言模型生成的文本表示，以测量古典中文语料库中的传统主义、规范力量和集体主义等心理构建。鉴于可用数据的稀缺性，我们提出了间接监督对比学习方法，并建立了第一个中文...",
