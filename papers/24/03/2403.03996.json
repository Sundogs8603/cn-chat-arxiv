The proposed perspective focuses on three pillars for examining flood risk: (1) inherent susceptibility, (2) mitigation strategies, and (3) external stressors. These pillars collectively encompass the physical and environmental characteristics of urban areas, the effectiveness of human-intervention measures, and the influence of uncontrollable external factors, offering a fresh point of view for decoding flood risks. For each pillar, we delineate its individual contributions to flood risk and illustrate their interactive and overall impact. The three-pillars model embodies a shift in focus from the quest to precisely model and quantify flood risk to evaluating pathways to high flood risk.

    "translated_abstract": "受健康风险评估思想启发，本文提出了洪水风险评估的新视角。提出的视角主要关注三个支柱来研究洪水风险：(1)固有易感性，(2)缓解策略，以及(3)外部压力因素。这些支柱共同涵盖了城市地区的物理和环境特征，人类干预措施的有效性和无法控制的外部因素的影响，为解码洪水风险提供了新的视角。对于每个支柱，我们描述了其对洪水风险的个别贡献，并阐明了它们的相互作用和总体影响。这一三支柱模型体现了从精确建模和量化洪水风险的追求到评估高洪水风险路径的关注转变。这种视角的转变旨在减轻对细分辨率量化和预测洪水风险作为解药的追求。",
