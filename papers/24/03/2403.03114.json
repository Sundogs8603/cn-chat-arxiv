    "translated_abstract": "我们将竞争性设施选址视为一个带有两种客户类型的两阶段多代理系统。对于具有加权客户的主机图，首先设施代理者战略性地选择开设设施的顶点。然后，客户战略性地选择在其邻域内的哪个开设设施消费。设施希望尽可能吸引更多客户权重，客户希望最小化所选设施上的拥挤。所有最近研究的此模型版本都假定客户可以战略性地分担他们的权重。我们考虑具有不可分割权重的客户，但允许混合策略。因此，客户可以在哪个设施消费上随机选择。除了对自然客户行为进行建模外，这种微妙的变化会产生 drast 剧烈的变化，例如，在给定设施布置时，可能出现截然不同的客户均衡。作为我们的主要结果，我们展示了纯子博弈完美",
