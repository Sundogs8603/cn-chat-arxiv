    "translated_abstract": "肺气肿是肺组织进行性不可逆性的损失，在肺病理学和肺部计算机断层扫描（CT）图像上通常被分类为三个亚型。最近的研究导致了在肺部CT上无监督学习了十个空间信息的肺部纹理图案（sLTP），表示基于肺气肿肺实质的纹理外观和肺部内的空间位置的不同模式，并聚合成6个稳健且可重复的CT肺气肿亚型（CTES）。然而，现有的sLTP分割方法对CT获取协议的变化非常敏感且运行缓慢。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个用于在肺部CT上进行sLTP和CTES有监督分类的稳健3D压缩和激励CNN。我们的结果表明，该模型在两个独立队列上实现了准确和可重现的肺部CT扫描sLTP分割，独立于扫描仪制造商。",
