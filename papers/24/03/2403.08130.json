    "translated_abstract": "因果推断的关键输入是插补的反事实结果。插补错误可能源自于使用未处理观测值估计预测模型的抽样不确定性，或源自未被模型捕捉的样本外信息。尽管文献集中于抽样不确定性，但它随着样本量消失。经常被忽视的是样本外误差如果是相互或序列相关的话，可能对缺失的反事实结果具有信息性。在时间序列设置中，受Goldberger (1962)的最佳线性无偏预测器（\\blup）的启发，我们提出了一种改进的预测器，用于当误差相关时的潜在结果。所提出的\\pup\\;在实践中非常实用，因为它不限于线性模型，可以与已经开发的一致估计器一起使用，并改善了大类强混合误差过程的均方误差。",
