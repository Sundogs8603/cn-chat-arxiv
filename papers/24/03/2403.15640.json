    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种新颖的多臂老虎机框架，称为背景下不安静的老虎机（CRB），用于复杂的在线决策。这种CRB框架融合了上下文老虎机和不安静老虎机的核心特征，因此可以模拟每只臂的内部状态转换和外部全局环境上下文的影响。通过双重分解方法，我们开发了一种可扩展的指数策略算法，用于解决CRB问题，并从理论上分析了该算法的渐近最优性。在臂模型未知的情况下，我们进一步提出了一种基于指数策略的模型为基础的在线学习算法，用于同时学习臂模型和做出决策。此外，我们特别将所提出的CRB框架和指数策略算法应用于智能电网中的需求响应决策问题。数值模拟证明了该算法的性能和鲁棒性。",
