Moreover, the rules are often complex and change regularly. Therefore, payroll management systems must be flexible in design. In this paper, we suggest an approach based on a flexible Answer Set Programming (ASP) model and an easy-to-read tabular representation based on the Decision Model and Notation (DMN) standard. It allows HR consultants to represent complex rules without the need for a software engineer, and to ultimately design payroll systems for a variety of different scenarios. We show how the multi-shot solving capabilities of the clingo ASP system can be used to reach the performance that is necessary to handle real-world instances.",

    "translated_abstract": "薪酬管理是一个关键的业务任务，受到大量规则的约束，这些规则在公司、行业和国家之间变化很大。此外，这些规则通常很复杂并且经常变化。因此，薪酬管理系统必须在设计上具有灵活性。本文提出了一种基于灵活答案集编程（ASP）模型和基于决策模型和符号标记（DMN）标准的易于阅读的表格表示的方法。它允许人力资源咨询师代表复杂规则，而无需软件工程师的参与，并最终为各种不同情景设计薪酬系统。我们展示了clingo ASP系统的多次求解能力如何可以用于达到处理实际情况所需的性能。",
