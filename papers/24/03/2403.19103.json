    "translated_abstract": "提示工程对于控制文本到图像（T2I）生成模型的输出是有效的，但由于需要手动制作提示而导致工作繁重。这一挑战促使了自动提示生成算法的发展。然而，这些方法通常在T2I模型之间的可传递性方面遇到困难，需要对基础模型进行白盒访问，并产生非直观的提示。在这项工作中，我们介绍了PRISM，这是一种算法，可以仅使用黑盒访问T2I模型就自动识别人类可解释且易传递的提示，从而有效生成所需概念。受大型语言模型（LLM）越狱的启发，PRISM利用LLM的上下文学习能力来迭代地改进给定参考图像的候选提示分布。我们的实验展示了PRISM在为对象、样式等生成准确提示方面的多样性和有效性。",
