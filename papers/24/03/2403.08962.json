The study focused on five pig characteristics, being these caudophagy, ear hematoma, scratches on the body, redness, and natural stains (brown or black). The results of the study showed that D-CNN was effective in classifying deviations in pig body morphologies related to skin characteristics. The evaluation was conducted by analyzing the performance metrics Precision, Recall, and F-score, as well as the statistical analyses ANOVA and the Scott-Knott test.

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在评估使用深度卷积神经网络（D-CNN）算法来对猪的身体条件进行正常或异常分类，重点关注卫生监测中观察到的特征，并使用六种不同的算法来完成此任务。研究聚焦于五个猪的特征，包括尾巴啃食、耳部血肿、身体抓痕、红斑和自然污渍（棕色或黑色）。研究结果显示，D-CNN在对与皮肤特征相关的猪体形态偏差进行分类方面是有效的。评估通过分析准确率、召回率和F分数等性能指标以及统计分析ANOVA和Scott-Knott测试完成。本文的贡献在于提出使用D-CNN网络进行猪类形态分类，重点关注卫生监测中识别到的特征。",
