However, aligning WSIs with diagnostic captions presents a significant challenge. This difficulty arises from two main factors: 1) Gigapixel WSIs are unsuitable for direct input into deep learning models, and the redundancy and correlation among the patches demand more attention; and 2) Authentic WSI diagnostic captions are extremely limited, making it difficult to train an effective model. To overcome these obstacles, we present PathM3, a multimodal, multi-task, multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for WSI classification and captioning. PathM3 adapts a query-based transformer to effectively align WSIs with diagnostic captions. Given that histopathology visual patterns are redundantly distributed across WSIs, we aggregate each patch feature with MIL method that considers t",

    "translated_abstract": "在计算组织病理学领域，整个切片图像（WSIs）和诊断性字幕都为做出诊断决策提供了宝贵的见解。然而，将WSIs与诊断性字幕对齐是一个重大挑战，主要源自两个因素：1）巨型像素WSIs不适合直接输入深度学习模型，而图块间的冗余性和相关性要求更多注意；2）真实的WSI诊断性字幕极其有限，使得难以训练出有效的模型。",
