    "translated_abstract": "优化许多目标（由任务或客户端实例化）与少数帕累托固定解决方案（模型）的性能对于机器学习至关重要。然而，先前的多目标优化方法通常关注少量目标，无法扩展到多个数目超过解决方案的目标，导致性能不佳或被忽略的目标。我们提出了Many-objective multi-solution Transport（MosT），这是一个框架，可以在许多目标的帕累托前沿找到多个多样化解决方案。我们的见解是寻找多个解决方案，每个解决方案都像领域专家一样执行，并专注于特定子目标集，同时共同涵盖所有目标。MosT将问题表述为每个解决方案的加权目标的双层优化，其中权重由目标和解决方案之间的最优传输定义。我们的算法确保收敛到帕累托站点。",
