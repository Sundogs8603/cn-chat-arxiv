Speakers must call words to mind, listeners must make sense of them, and both together must negotiate this flow of information, all in fractions of a second. We used large language models to study how this works in a large-scale dataset of English-language conversation, the CANDOR corpus. We provide a new estimate of the information density of unstructured conversation, of approximately 13 bits/second, and find significant effects associated with the cognitive load of both retrieving, and presenting, that information. We also reveal a role for backchannels -- the brief yeahs, uh-huhs, and mhmms that listeners provide -- in regulating the production of novelty: the lead-up to a backchannel is associated with declining information rate, while speech downstream rebounds to previous rates.

    "translated_abstract": "对话需要注意力。说话者必须召唤单词，听者必须理解它们，两者必须共同协商这些信息流，所有这些都在几分之一秒内完成。我们使用大型语言模型研究了英语对话大规模数据集CANDOR语料库中的工作方式。我们提供了一种对非结构化对话信息密度的新估算，约为每秒13位，并发现检索和呈现信息的认知负荷与之相关的显著效应。我们还揭示了backchannels的作用-听众提供的简短的“是的”、“嗯嗯”和“嗯”的作用在调节新颖性的产生：导致backchannel的阶段与信息速率的下降相关，而随后的言语恢复到先前的速率。我们的结果为长期以来关于我们如何应对认知资源波动需求的理论提供了新的见解。",
