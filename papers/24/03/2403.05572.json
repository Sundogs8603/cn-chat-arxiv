We employ a rigorous evaluation methodology, involving a between-groups study with 600 participants, to evaluate the level of empathy in responses generated by humans and ChatGPT. ChatGPT is prompted in two distinct ways: a standard approach and one explicitly detailing empathy's cognitive, affective, and compassionate counterparts. Our findings indicate that the average empathy rating of responses generated by ChatGPT exceeds those crafted by humans by approximately 10%.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了ChatGPT以及尤其是其最新版本GPT-4在回应各种情绪场景（包括积极和消极情绪）时的移情能力，与人类生成的回应进行对比。我们采用严谨的评估方法，通过一个涉及600名参与者的组间研究来评估ChatGPT生成的回应中的移情水平。ChatGPT被提示的方式有两种：一种是标准方法，另一种明确详细说明了移情的认知、情感和同情方面。我们的发现表明，ChatGPT生成的回应的平均移情评分超过了人类生成的回应约10%。此外，指示ChatGPT在其回应中融入对移情的清晰理解使得这些回应与高度移情的个体的期望大致接近多达5倍。",
