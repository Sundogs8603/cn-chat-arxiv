Various chart-related downstream tasks have emerged recently, such as question-answering and summarization. A common strategy to solve these tasks is to fine-tune various models originally trained on vision tasks language. However, such task-specific models are not capable of solving a wide range of chart-related tasks, constraining their real-world applicability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ChartInstruct: a novel chart-specific vision-language Instruction-following dataset comprising 191K instructions generated with 71K charts. We then present two distinct systems for instruction tuning on such datasets: (1) an end-to-end model that connects a vision encoder for chart understanding with a LLM; and (2) a pipeline model that employs a two-step approach to extract chart data table",

    "translated_abstract": "图表提供数据的可视化表示，被广泛用于分析信息，解决问题，并向他人传达见解。最近出现了各种与图表相关的下游任务，例如问答和摘要。解决这些任务的常见策略是微调最初在视觉任务上训练的各种模型。然而，这种任务特定的模型无法解决广泛的与图表相关的任务，限制了它们在现实世界中的适用性。为了克服这些挑战，我们引入了ChartInstruct：一个新颖的图表特定的视觉-语言指令遵循数据集，包括191K个指令和71K张图表。然后，我们提出了两种不同的用于在该数据集上进行指令调整的系统：（1）连接用于图表理解的视觉编码器和LLM的端到端模型；和（2）采用两步方法来提取图表数据表格的流水线模型。",
