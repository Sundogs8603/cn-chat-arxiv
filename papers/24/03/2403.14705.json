    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.14705v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Artificial agents that learn to communicate in order to accomplish a given task acquire communication protocols that are typically opaque to a human. A large body of work has attempted to evaluate the emergent communication via various evaluation measures, with \\emph{compositionality} featuring as a prominent desired trait. However, current evaluation procedures do not directly expose the compositionality of the emergent communication. We propose a procedure to assess the compositionality of emergent communication by finding the best-match between emerged words and natural language concepts. The best-match algorithm provides both a global score and a translation-map from emergent words to natural language concepts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that such direct and interpretable mapping between emergent words and human concepts is provided.",

    "translated_abstract": "学习沟通以完成给定任务的人工智能代理获取的通信协议通常对人类来说是不透明的。大量研究尝试通过各种评估方法评估新兴通信，其中\\emph{组合性}是一个突出的期望特征。然而，当前的评估程序并未直接暴露新兴通信的组合性。我们提出了一种评估新兴通信组合性的方法，即找到新兴词汇与自然语言概念之间的最佳匹配。最佳匹配算法提供了全局分数和从新兴词汇到自然语言概念的翻译映射。据我们所知，这是首次提供新兴词汇与人类概念之间直接而可解释的映射。",
