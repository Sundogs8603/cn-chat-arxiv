Among the many ways to deal with it, there are important protocols that make use of egg numbers in ovitraps to calculate indices, such as the LIRAa and the Breteau Index, which can provide information on predictable outbursts and epidemics. Also, there are many research lines that require egg numbers, specially when mass production of mosquitoes is needed. Egg counting is a laborious and error-prone task that can be automated via computer vision-based techniques, specially deep learning-based counting with object detection.

    "translated_abstract": "伊氏伊蚊仍然是疾病传播媒介时的主要关注对象。在处理这个问题的许多方法中，有一些重要的协议利用卵数在卵罗捕器中来计算指标，如LIRAa和Breteau指数，可以提供关于可预测的暴发和流行病的信息。此外，许多研究领域需要卵数，特别是在需要大规模培育蚊子时。卵计数是一个繁琐且容易出错的任务，可以通过基于计算机视觉的技术，特别是基于深度学习的目标检测来实现自动化。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新的数据集，包括野外和实验室的卵，以及三种应用于该任务的神经网络测试结果：Faster R-CNN、Side-Aware Boundary Localization和FoveaBox。",
