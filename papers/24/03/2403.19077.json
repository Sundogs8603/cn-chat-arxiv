    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.19077v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we take a close look at a problem labeled maximal extractable value (MEV), which arises in a blockchain due to the ability of a block producer to manipulate the order of transactions within a block. Indeed, blockchains such as Ethereum have spent considerable resources addressing this issue and have redesigned the block production process to account for MEV. This paper provides an overview of the MEV problem and tracks how Ethereum has adapted to its presence. A vital aspect of the block building exercise is that it is a variant of the knapsack problem. Consequently, this paper highlights the role of designing auctions to fill a knapsack--or knapsack auctions--in alleviating the MEV problem. Overall, this paper presents a survey of the main issues and an accessible primer for researchers and students wishing to explore the economics of block building and MEV further.",

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们深入研究了一个被标记为最大可提取价值（MEV）的问题，这个问题在区块链中出现，因为一个区块生产者可以操纵一个区块内交易的顺序。事实上，诸如以太坊等区块链已经花费了大量资源来解决这个问题，并重新设计了区块生产过程以解决MEV。本文概述了MEV问题，并跟踪了以太坊如何适应其存在。区块构建过程的一个关键方面是它是背包问题的一个变体。因此，本文突出了设计拍卖来填充背包——或背包拍卖——以缓解MEV问题的作用。总的来说，本文对主要问题进行了调查，并为希望进一步探讨区块构建和MEV经济学的研究人员和学生提供了易于理解的入门指南。",
