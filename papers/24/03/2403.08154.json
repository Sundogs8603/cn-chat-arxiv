    "translated_abstract": "土壤湿度是一个对人类社会和环境都具有重要意义的关键水文参数。在作物田地中准确建模和监测土壤湿度，尤其是在根系区（土壤表层100厘米）中，对于借助精准灌溉和耕作工具来提高农业生产和作物产量至关重要。充分实现传感器数据潜力在很大程度上取决于先进的领域感知模型和预测能力。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个基于物理约束的深度学习（P-DL）框架，将水分传输和水分传感信号的基于物理的原则整合在一起，以有效重建土壤湿度动态。我们采用了三种不同的优化器，即Adam、RMSprop和GD，在训练过程中最小化P-DL的损失函数。在说明性案例研究中，我们展示了Adam优化器的经验收敛优于其他优化方法。",
