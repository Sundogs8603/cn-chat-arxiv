In this study, we leverage federated learning strategies to address clopidogrel treatment failure detection. Our research harnesses the collaborative power of multiple healthcare institutions, allowing them to jointly train machine learning models while safeguarding sensitive patient data. Utilizing the UK Biobank dataset, which encompasses a vast and diverse population, we partitioned the data based on geographic centers and evaluated the performance of federated learning. Our results show that while centralized training achieves higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) values and faster convergence, federated learning approaches can substantially narrow this performance gap.

    "translated_abstract": "氯吡格雷是一种广泛使用的抗血小板药物，其有效性在个体之间存在显著差异，必须开发精确的预测模型以优化患者护理。在这项研究中，我们利用联邦学习策略来处理氯吡格雷治疗失败的检测。我们的研究利用多个医疗机构的协作力量，使它们能够共同训练机器学习模型，同时保护敏感的患者数据。利用涵盖广泛且多样化人口的英国生物银行数据集，我们基于地理中心对数据进行分区，并评估了联邦学习的性能。我们的结果表明，虽然集中式训练可以获得更高的曲线下面积（AUC）值和更快的收敛速度，但联邦学习方法可以显著缩小这种性能差距。我们的发现强调了联邦学习在应对氯吡格雷治疗失败问题中的潜力。",
