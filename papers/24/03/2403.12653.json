A simulation study shows that it delivers good performance in these settings and improves upon a method-of-moments estimation. In an application, we inspect the dynamic of an intraday measure of spot variance computed with high-frequency data from the cryptocurrency market. The empirical evidence supports a mechanism, where the short- and long-term correlation structure of stochastic volatility are decoupled in order to capture its properties at different time scales.",
