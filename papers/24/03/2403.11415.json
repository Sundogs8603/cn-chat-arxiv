    "translated_abstract": "反向采样和分数蒸馏已成为最近几年使用潜在扩散模型（LDMs）进行图像处理的主要工具。虽然反向扩散采样通常需要调整LDM架构或特征工程，分数蒸馏提供了一种简单而强大的与模型无关的方法，但往往容易发生模式崩溃。为了解决这些局限性并利用这两种方法的优势，我们引入了一个称为DreamSampler的新颖框架，通过正则化潜在优化的视角无缝地整合了这两种不同的方法。类似于分数蒸馏，DreamSampler是一种适用于任何LDM架构的模型无关方法，但它允许在图像编辑和重构中进行蒸馏和反向采样，并提供额外的指导。通过涉及图像编辑、SVG重构等实验，我们展示了竞争力",
