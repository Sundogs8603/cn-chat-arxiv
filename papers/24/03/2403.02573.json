    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.02573v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We consider a discrete-time system where a resource-constrained source (e.g., a small sensor) transmits its time-sensitive data to a destination over a time-varying wireless channel. Each transmission incurs a fixed transmission cost (e.g., energy cost), and no transmission results in a staleness cost represented by the Age-of-Information. The source must balance the tradeoff between transmission and staleness costs. To address this challenge, we develop a robust online algorithm to minimize the sum of transmission and staleness costs, ensuring a worst-case performance guarantee. While online algorithms are robust, they are usually overly conservative and may have a poor average performance in typical scenarios. In contrast, by leveraging historical data and prediction models, machine learning (ML) algorithms perform well in average cases. However, they typically lack worst-case performance guarantees.

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑一个离散时间系统，一个资源受限的来源（例如，一个小型传感器）通过一个时变无线信道将其及时数据传输给目的地。每次传输会产生固定的传输成本（例如，能量成本），而没有传输会导致一个以信息时代表示的陈旧成本。来源必须在传输成本和陈旧成本之间取得平衡。为了解决这一挑战，我们开发了一个强大的在线算法，以最小化传输和陈旧成本的总和，确保最坏情况下的性能保证。尽管在线算法是稳健的，但它们通常过于保守，在典型情况下可能表现不佳。相反，通过利用历史数据和预测模型，机器学习（ML）算法在平均情况下表现良好。但是，它们通常缺乏最坏情况下的性能保证。为了实现最好的两种情况，我们提出了一种学习增强的在线最小化信息时代和传输成本的方法。",
