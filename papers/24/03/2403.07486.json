    "translated_abstract": "近年来，可解释人工智能（XAI）方法已经促进了深入验证和知识提取机器学习模型。尽管针对分类进行了广泛研究，但很少有XAI解决方案解决了特定于回归模型的挑战。在回归中，解释需要精确制定以应对特定用户查询（例如区分“为什么输出大于0？”和“为什么输出大于50？”）。此外，它们应反映模型在相关数据子流形上的行为。在本文中，我们介绍了XpertAI，这是一个将预测策略解开为多个范围特定的子策略，并允许将对模型的精准查询（“被解释物”）的制定为这些子策略的线性组合的框架。XpertAI通常制定可以与基于遮挡、梯度集成或反向传播的流行XAI归因技术一起使用。",
