We contend that large repositories of Brazilian-named entities (people, places, organizations, and political events and movements) would be beneficial for extracting information from Portuguese texts. We show that many of the terms/entities described in the DHBB do not have corresponding concepts (or Q items) in Wikidata, the largest structured database of entities associated with Wikipedia. We describe previous work on extracting information from the DHBB and outline the steps to construct a Wikidata-based historical knowledge graph.",
