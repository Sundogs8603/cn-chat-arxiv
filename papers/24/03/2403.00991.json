In this paper, we propose an online learning method, SELFI, that leverages online robot experience to rapidly fine-tune pre-trained control policies efficiently. SELFI applies online model-free reinforcement learning on top of offline model-based learning to bring out the best parts of both learning paradigms. Specifically, SELFI stabilizes the online learning process by incorporating the same model-based learning objective from offline pre-training into the Q-values learned with online model-free reinforcement learning. We evaluate SELFI in multiple real-world environments and report improvements in terms of collision avoidance, as well as more socially compliant behavior, measured by a human user study.

    "translated_abstract": "自主自我改进的机器人通过与环境互动和经验积累来实现将是机器人系统在现实世界中投入使用的关键。本文提出了一种在线学习方法SELFI，利用在线机器人经验来快速高效地微调预训练的控制策略。SELFI将在线无模型强化学习应用于离线基于模型的学习之上，以发挥这两种学习范式的优点。具体来说，SELFI通过将离线预训练的模型学习目标与在线无模型强化学习中学习到的Q值相结合，稳定了在线学习过程。我们在多个现实环境中评估了SELFI，并报告了在避撞方面的改善，以及通过人类用户研究测量的更具社交遵从行为。SELFI使我们能够快速学习有用的机器人行为，减少了预先干预的人员干预。",
