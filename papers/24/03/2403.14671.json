This study explores two neighborhoods with distinct urban designs: South End, Charlotte, NC, featuring a dynamic mixed-use urban design pattern, and Avondale, Chattanooga, TN, with a residential suburban grid layout. Using the TRANSIT-GYM tool, we assess the impact of increased bus utilization in these different urban settings on traffic and CO2 emissions. Our results highlight the critical role of urban design and planning in transit system efficiency. In South End, the mixed-use design led to more substantial emission reductions, indicating that urban layout can significantly influence public transit outcomes. Tailored strategies that consider the unique urban design elements are essential for climate resilience. Notably, doubling bus utilization decreased daily emissions by 10.18% in South End a",

    "translated_abstract": "城市设计在可持续性方面具有重要影响，特别是在公共交通效率和减少碳排放方面。本研究探讨了具有不同城市设计的两个社区：北卡罗来纳州夏洛特市南端，具有动态混合用途的城市设计模式；和田纳西州查塔努加市阿冯代尔，采用住宅郊区网格布局。通过使用TRANSIT-GYM工具，我们评估了在这些不同城市环境中增加公共汽车利用率对交通和CO2排放的影响。我们的结果突显了城市设计和规划在交通系统效率中的关键作用。在夏洛特市南端，混合用途设计导致更多的排放减少，表明城市布局可以显著影响公共交通结果。考虑到独特的城市设计元素的量身定制策略对于气候适应至关重要。值得注意的是，在南端，公共汽车利用率翻倍使日常排放减少了10.18％。",
