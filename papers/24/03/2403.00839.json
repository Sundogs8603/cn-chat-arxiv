    "translated_abstract": "尽管在各种任务中取得了显著进展，但大型语言模型（LLMs）在正确使用海量外部工具方面仍然存在显著局限。现有的上下文学习方法简单地将工具格式化为一列纯文本描述，并将其输入到LLMs中，然后LLMs生成一系列工具调用序列以逐步解决问题。这种范式忽略了工具之间的内在依赖，并将所有推理负载转移到LLMs上，使其局限于一小部分专门设计的工具。因此，对LLMs来说，要在大量工具库上运行仍然具有挑战性，当面临现实场景时存在着很大限制。本文提出了ToolNet，一个即插即用的框架，通过适度增加标记消耗，将工具的数量扩展到数千个。ToolNet将工具组织成一个有向图。每个节点代表一个工具，加权边表示…",
