Without relying on channel state information at devices, this scheme employs lattice codes to both quantize model parameters and exploit interference from the devices. A novel two-layer receiver structure at the server is designed to reliably decode an integer combination of the quantized model parameters as a lattice point for the purpose of aggregation.
