    "translated_abstract": "研究了周期性增长过程。根据应计基础，利润率的期望值既不直接取决于减值，也不取决于资本化路径。资本化的期望值是路径依赖的。由于依赖路径的资本化，资本的回报率也是路径依赖的，而资本的时间平均回报率与增长周期的期望值回报率不同。在没有中间减值的情况下，内部收益率是路径无关的，因此与资本回报率的期望值不同。结果表明，使权益回报率最大化的旋转周期长度与市场利率无关。杠杆效应通过一个单独的杠杆方程进入增长过程的微观经济学中，杠杆系数可能达到正值或负值。",
    "tldr": "本研究发现，在周期性增长过程中，资本化的期望值取决于路径，从而导致资本的回报率和时间平均回报率取决于路径，且内部收益率与资本回报率的期望值不同。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study reveals that in periodic growth processes, the expected value of capitalization is path-dependent, leading to path-dependent return rate on capital and time-average return rate on capital, which differ from the expected value of return rate on capital, while the internal rate of return differs from the expected value of the rate of return on capital."
