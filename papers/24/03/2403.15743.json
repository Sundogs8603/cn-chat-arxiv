    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们展示了由经典运动规划工具设计的控制器，即人工势场（APFs），可以从最近普及的方法中得到：控制屏障函数二次规划（CBF-QP）安全滤波器。通过将APF信息整合到CBF-QP框架中，我们建立了这两种方法之间的桥梁。具体而言，这是通过将有吸引力的势场作为控制李雅普诺夫函数（CLF）来引导名义控制器的设计，然后将排斥性势场作为相互作用CBF（RCBF）来定义一个CBF-QP安全滤波器。基于这种整合，我们将CBF-QP安全滤波器的设计扩展到适应更一般的包含控制仿射结构的动力学模型类。这种扩展产生了一种特殊的CBF-QP安全滤波器和适用于控制仿射动力学模型的一般APF解决方案。",
