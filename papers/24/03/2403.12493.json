In this paper we propose a trainable feature extraction module for deep neural networks. The purpose of this module is to transform a scanpath into a feature vector which is directly useable for the deep neural network architecture. Based on the backpropagated error of the deep neural network, the feature extraction module adapts its parameters to improve the classification performance. Therefore, our feature extraction module is jointly trainable with the deep neural network.

We evaluated our module on three public datasets and compared it to the state of the art approaches.",
