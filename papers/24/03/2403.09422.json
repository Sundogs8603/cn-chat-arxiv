We investigate pitfalls in this approach, discovering the issue of attribute amplification, where unrelated attributes are spuriously affected during interventions, leading to biases across protected characteristics and disease status. We show that attribute amplification is caused by the use of hard labels in the counterfactual training process and propose soft counterfactual fine-tuning to mitigate this issue.

    "translated_abstract": "因果生成建模在医学影像领域备受关注，因其能够回答干预和反事实查询。大多数研究侧重于生成看起来合理的反事实图像，使用辅助分类器来强化模拟干预的有效性。我们调查了这种方法中的缺陷，发现了属性放大问题，即在干预过程中会误伤无关属性，导致受保护特征和疾病状态之间的偏见。我们展示了属性放大是由反事实训练过程中使用硬标签引起的，并提出了软反事实微调以缓解这一问题。我们的方法显著减少了放大效应，同时保持了生成图像的有效性，在大型胸部X射线数据集上进行了演示。我们的工作在实现更加忠实和无偏向的因果生成方面取得了重要进展。",
