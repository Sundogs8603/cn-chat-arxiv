In this study, we empirically assess the extrapolation capability of state-of-the-art template-free models by meticulously assembling an extensive set of out-of-distribution (OOD) reactions. Our findings demonstrate that while template-free models exhibit potential in predicting precursors with novel synthesis rules, their top-10 exact-match accuracy in OOD reactions is strikingly modest (< 1%).
