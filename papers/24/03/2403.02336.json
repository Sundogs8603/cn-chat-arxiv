This paper introduces a comprehensive framework to measure the brand logo's attention on a packaging design. The proposed method consists of three steps. The first step leverages YOLOv8 for precise logo detection across prominent datasets, FoodLogoDet-1500 and LogoDet-3K. The second step involves modeling the user's visual attention with a novel saliency prediction model tailored for the packaging context. The proposed saliency model combines the visual elements with text maps employing a transformers-based architecture to predict user attention maps.

    "translated_abstract": "在产品营销领域的激烈竞争中，包装上品牌标志的可见度在塑造消费者认知、直接影响产品成功方面起着至关重要的作用。本文引入了一个全面的框架来衡量包装设计中品牌标志的关注度。所提出的方法包括三个步骤。第一步利用YOLOv8在显著数据集FoodLogoDet-1500和LogoDet-3K上进行精确的标志检测。第二步涉及使用一种专为包装上下文量身定制的新型显著性预测模型建模用户的视觉注意力。所提出的显著性模型结合了视觉元素与文本映射，利用基于transformers的架构预测用户注意力图。在第三步中，通过将标志检测与显著性图生成相结合，该框架提供了全面的品牌关注分数。所提出方法的有效性得到了评估。",
