To achieve this, we utilize the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) framework and design a new adaptive exponentially weighted Asymptotic-Preserving (AP) loss function, which incorporates the macroscopic auxiliary equation that is derived from the original transfer equation directly and explicitly contains the information of the diffusion limit equation. Thus, as the scale parameter tends to zero, the loss function gradually transitions from the transport state to the diffusion limit state. In addition, the initial data, boundary conditions, and conservation laws serve as the regularization terms for the loss. We present several numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of MA-APNNs.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了一种宏观辅助渐近保持神经网络（MA-APNN）方法来解决具有多尺度性质和高维度的时变线性辐射传递方程（LRTEs）。为实现这一目标，我们利用了物理信息神经网络（PINNs）框架，并设计了一种新的自适应指数加权渐近保持（AP）损失函数，该函数包含了直接从原始传递方程导出的宏观辅助方程，并明确地包含扩散极限方程的信息。因此，随着尺度参数趋向于零，损失函数逐渐从输运态过渡到扩散极限态。此外，初始数据、边界条件和守恒定律作为损失的正则化项。我们提供了几个数值示例来展示MA-APNN的有效性。",
