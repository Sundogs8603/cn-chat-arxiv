    "translated_abstract": "迭代重新加权L1（IRL1）算法是一种常见算法，用于解决具有非凸和非光滑正则化的稀疏优化问题。其加速算法的发展，通常采用Nesterov加速，引起了极大兴趣。然而，这些加速算法的收敛性和复杂性分析一直存在重大挑战。最近，Anderson加速因其在加速固定点迭代方面的出色性能而备受瞩目，许多最近的研究将其应用于基于梯度的算法。受到Anderson加速强大影响的启发，我们提出了一种Anderson加速的IRL1算法，并建立了其局部线性收敛速度。我们将这一通常在平滑设置中观察到的收敛结果扩展到非光滑场景。重要的是，我们的理论结果不依赖于Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz条件。",
