This ability is assumed to derive through the identification and extraction of statistically recurrent forms. We examine this assumption by asking how NMS segmentations compare to those produced by Morfessor, an unsupervised machine learning model that operates based on statistical recurrence, across words formed by a variety of morphological processes. Both NMS and Morfessor succeed in segmenting words formed by concatenative processes (compounding and affixation without allomorphy), but NMS also succeed for words that invoke templates (reduplication and allomorphy) and other cues to morphological structure, implying that their learning process is sensitive to more than just statistical recurrence.",

    "translated_abstract": "非毛利族裔的新西兰人(NMS)能够以一种与流利的毛利语使用者（Panther等人，2024）非常相似的方式分割毛利语单词。这种能力被认为是通过识别和提取统计重复形式而获得的。本文通过比较NMS和Morfessor对由各种形态过程形成的单词的分割，来检验这一假设。NMS和Morfessor均成功地分割由连接过程（构词和词缀化没有变音的过程）形成的单词，但NMS还成功地分割涉及模板（重复和变音）和其他形态结构线索的单词，这意味着他们的学习过程对不仅仅是统计重复敏感。",
    "tldr": "NMS和Morfessor在分割由不同形态过程形成的单词中表现出成功，NMS对模板和其他形态结构线索也表现出敏感，显示出他们的学习过程不仅仅受到统计重复的影响。",
