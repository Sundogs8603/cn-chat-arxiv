Traditional methods for data copyright protection are applied prior to data distribution, implying that models trained on these data become uncontrollable. This paper introduces a novel approach, named DataCook, designed to safeguard the copyright of healthcare data during the deployment phase. DataCook operates by \"cooking\" the raw data before distribution, enabling the development of models that perform normally on this processed data. However, during the deployment phase, the original test data must be also \"cooked\" through DataCook to ensure normal model performance.

    "translated_abstract": "在医疗保健领域，版权保护和未经授权的第三方滥用的挑战日益重要。传统的数据版权保护方法应用于数据发布之前，这意味着对这些数据训练的模型变得不可控制。本文介绍了一种名为DataCook的新方法，旨在在部署阶段保护医疗保健数据的版权。DataCook通过在分发之前“处理”原始数据的方式运行，从而使开发的模型在这些处理过的数据上表现正常。然而，在部署阶段，原始测试数据也必须通过DataCook“处理”以确保模型正常运行。该过程使版权持有人在部署阶段控制授权。DataCook背后的机制是制作反对抗样本（AntiAdv），旨在增强模型的信心，而不是。",
