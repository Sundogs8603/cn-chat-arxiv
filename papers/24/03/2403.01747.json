Traditional web search interfaces enable easy exploration of entities, but this is limited in conversational settings due to the limited-bandwidth interface. This paper explore ways to rewrite answers in CIS, so that users can understand them without having to resort to external services or sources. Specifically, we focus on salient entities -- entities that are central to understanding the answer. As our first contribution, we create a dataset of conversations annotated with entities for saliency. Our analysis of the collected data reveals that the majority of answers contain salient entities. As our second contribution, we propose two answer rewriting strategies aimed at improving the overall user experience in CIS. One approach expands answers with inline definitions of salient entities, making the answer self-contained",

    "translated_abstract": "会话信息检索（CIS）是一种新兴的知识获取和探索性搜索范式。传统的网络搜索界面可以轻松探索实体，但在会话环境中受限于带宽有限的界面。本文探讨了在CIS中重写答案的方法，以便用户可以理解答案而无需求助外部服务或来源。具体而言，我们关注突出的实体--对于理解答案至关重要的实体。作为我们的第一个贡献，我们创建了一个带有突出实体注释的对话数据集。我们对收集到的数据进行分析后发现，大多数答案包含了突出实体。作为我们的第二个贡献，我们提出了两种旨在改善CIS中用户体验的答案重写策略。其一通过内联定义突出实体来扩展答案，使答案自包含。",
