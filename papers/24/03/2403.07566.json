    "translated_abstract": "血糖（BG）控制涉及通过体外胰岛素注射将个体的血糖维持在健康范围内，这对于1型糖尿病患者来说是一项重要任务。然而，传统的患者自我管理方式繁琐且危险。最近的研究致力于探索个性化和自动化的BG控制方法，其中深度强化学习（DRL）显示出作为新兴方法的潜力。在本文中，我们使用药物浓度的指数衰减模型将BG控制问题的形式化转换为MDP，考虑到药物作用的延迟和持久性，从PAE-POMDP（持续行动效果-部分可见马尔可夫决策过程）到MDP，并提出一种新颖的基于多步DRL的算法来解决该问题。其中还使用了优先经验回放（PER）采样方法。与单步自举更新相比，多步学习",
