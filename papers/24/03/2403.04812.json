    "translated_abstract": "最近深度学习（DL）取得的成就展示了其在预测交通流量方面的潜力。这些预测有助于理解情况并在交通控制中做出决策。然而，大多数先进的DL模型被认为是“黑盒子”，对于终端用户来说基本没有透明度，无法了解底层机制。一些先前的工作尝试“打开黑盒子”并增加生成预测的可解释性。然而，处理大规模时空数据上的复杂模型并发现显著影响交通流量的关键空间和时间模式仍然具有挑战性。为了克服这些挑战，我们提出了 TrafPS，一种用于解释交通预测结果的视觉分析方法，以支持交通管理和城市规划中的决策制定。测量方法，区域 SHAP 和轨迹 SHAP，被提出来量化影响",
