They are generated from scratch by fine-tuned encoder-decoder language models. The conducted human evaluation has shown that these definitions match the existing clusters in WUGs better than the definitions chosen from WordNet by two baseline systems. At the same time, the method is straightforward to use and easy to extend to new languages. The resulting enriched datasets can be extremely helpful for moving on to explainable semantic change modeling.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个词语使用图谱（WUGs）数据集，其中现有的多种语言的WUGs加入了作为意义定义的聚类标签。这些标签是通过经过微调的编码器-解码器语言模型从头开始生成的。进行的人类评估表明，这些定义与现有的WUGs中的簇更匹配，比起两个基线系统从WordNet中选择的定义。与此同时，这种方法易于使用且易于扩展到新的语言。产生的丰富数据集对于进行可解释的语义变化建模非常有帮助。",
