Despite these advancements, inherent biases in these models can lead to disparities in prediction accuracy across protected groups. In this study, we propose a framework to achieve accurate diagnostic outcomes and ensure fairness across intersectional groups in high-dimensional chest X- ray multi-label classification. Transcending traditional protected attributes, we consider complex interactions within social determinants, enabling a more granular benchmark and evaluation of fairness. We present a simple and robust method that involves retraining the last classification layer of pre-trained models using a balanced dataset across groups.

    "translated_abstract": "在使用胸部X射线进行疾病诊断方面，实施深度学习模型取得了显著进展。尽管取得了这些进展，但这些模型中固有的偏见可能导致跨受保护群体的预测准确性差异。在本研究中，我们提出了一个框架，以实现准确的诊断结果，并确保在高维胸部X射线多标签分类中跨交叉群体的公平性。我们不拘一格地考虑社会决定因素中的复杂相互作用，实现了更精细的公平性基准和评估。我们提出了一种简单而强大的方法，涉及使用跨组平衡数据集重新训练预先训练模型的最后分类层。此外，我们考虑了公平性约束，并为多标签设置整合了类平衡微调。我们在MIMIC-CXR数据集上评估了我们的方法，结果表明",
