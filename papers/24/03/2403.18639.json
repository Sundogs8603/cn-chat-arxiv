    "translated_abstract": "尽管进行了重大可靠性改进，但大规模云服务不可避免地会遭遇可能显著影响服务可用性和客户满意度的生产事故。更糟糕的是，在许多情况下，一个事件可能导致多个下游故障，由于级联效应而在不同的依赖服务之间创建几个相关事件。通常情况下，现场工程师(OCEs)在孤立情况下检查这些事件，这导致大量手动操作并增加了事件缓解的总时间。因此，开发高效的事件关联模型对于将相关事件分组到簇中以快速解决主要故障并降低现场工程师的疲劳至关重要。现有的事件关联方法主要利用事件的文本和上下文信息（如标题、描述、严重性、受影响组件），从而未能利用服务之间的相互依赖关系。",
