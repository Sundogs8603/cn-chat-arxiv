    "translated_abstract": "预路由定时预测最近被研究用于评估芯片设计中候选单元布局的质量。它直接估计引脚级（余量、斜率）和边级（网延迟、单元延迟）的定时指标，而无需耗时路由。然而，在大规模工业电路中，由于长时延路径，它经常遭受信号衰减和误差累积的困扰。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一个两阶段方法。首先，我们提出了全局电路训练来预训练一个图自动编码器，从电路网表中学习全局图嵌入。其次，我们使用一种新颖的节点更新方案进行GCN上的消息传递，遵循学习到的图嵌入和电路图的拓扑排序序列。这个方案在更新序列中残留地建模了相邻引脚之间的局部时间延迟，并通过一个注意力单元提取了每个单元内部的查找表信息。",
