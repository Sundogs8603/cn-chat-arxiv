    "translated_abstract": "本研究调查了六种主要生成式AI（GenAI）文本检测器在面对用于规避这些工具检测的技术修改的机器生成内容时的有效性（n = 805）。结果表明，检测器的准确率已经很低（39.5％），当面对被操纵的内容时，准确率显着降低（17.4％），并且一些技术在规避检测方面比其他技术更有效。 准确性限制和可能导致错误指控的情况表明，这些工具目前无法推荐用于确定是否发生了学术诚信的违规行为，突显了教育工作者在维护包容和公平评估实践方面面临的挑战。 但是，当以非惩罚性方式使用时，它们可能在支持学生学习和维护学术诚信方面发挥作用。 这些结果强调了需要综合方法的必要性",
