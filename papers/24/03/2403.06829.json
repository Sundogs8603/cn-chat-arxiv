The method works as a pre-processing step in which the continuous values of the variable to be regressed are discretized into a set of intervals which are then used to define value thresholds. Then classifiers are trained to predict whether the value to be regressed is less than or equal to each of these thresholds. The different outputs of the classifiers are then concatenated in the form of an additional vector of variables that enriches the initial vector of the regression problem. The implemented system can thus be considered as a generic pre-processing tool. We tested the proposed enrichment method with 5 types of regressors and evaluated it in 33 regression datasets. Our experimental results confirm the interest of the approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种方法，用于自动创建变量（在回归的情况下），以补充初始输入向量中所包含的信息。该方法作为预处理步骤运行，在该步骤中，要回归的变量的连续值被离散化为一组间隔，然后用于定义值阈。然后对分类器进行训练，以预测要回归的值是否小于或等于这些阈值中的每一个。然后分类器的不同输出被链接在一个附加的变量向量中，丰富了回归问题的初始向量。实现的系统因此可以被视为一种通用的预处理工具。我们通过5种类型的回归器测试了所提出的丰富方法，并在33个回归数据集中进行了评估。我们的实验证实了这种方法的有效性。",
