    "translated_abstract": "受元宇宙和边缘计算技术的巨大进展推动，预计车载边缘元宇宙将颠覆当前智能交通系统的范式。作为车载元宇宙用户（VMUs）的高度电算化化身，部署在边缘服务器中的车辆双子（VTs）可以提供宝贵的元宇宙服务，以改善其VMUs在整个行程中的驾驶安全性和车内满意度。为了保持不间断的元宇宙体验，VTs必须根据车辆的移动在边缘服务器之间进行迁移。这可能引发有关车载边缘元宇宙之间动态通信过程中隐私泄露的担忧。为了解决这些问题并保护位置隐私，可以利用假名作为临时标识符，由VMUs和VTs共同利用，在物理空间和虚拟空间中实现匿名通信。然而，现有的假名管理方法在满足需求方面存在不足",
