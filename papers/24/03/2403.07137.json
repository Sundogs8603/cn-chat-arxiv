This paper presents the results of a correlation analysis between scores produced by humans for Nelore cattle and a variety of measurements that can be derived from images or other instruments. It also presents a study using the k-means algorithm to generate new ways of clustering a batch of cattle using the measurements that most correlate with the animal's body weight and visual scores.",
