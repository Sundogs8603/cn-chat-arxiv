With hundreds of graph pre-training tasks proposed, integrating knowledge acquired from multiple pre-training tasks has become a popular research topic. In this paper, we identify two important collaborative processes for this topic: (1) select: how to select an optimal task combination from a given task pool based on their compatibility, and (2) weigh: how to weigh the selected tasks based on their importance. While there currently has been a lot of work focused on weighing, comparatively little effort has been devoted to selecting.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，图预训练在图表示学习中取得了巨大成功。伴随着数百种图预训练任务的提出，整合从多个预训练任务中获得的知识已成为一个热门研究课题。本文确定了此主题的两个重要协作过程：（1）选择：如何基于它们的兼容性从给定任务池中选择最佳任务组合，和（2）权衡：如何基于它们的重要性权衡所选任务。虽然目前有很多工作集中在权衡上，但相比之下，很少有工作致力于选择。本文提出了一种用于整合多个图预训练任务的新颖的实例级框架Weigh And Select（WAS），其中权衡和选择这两个协作过程通过解耦的连体网络进行组合。具体而言，它首先自适应地学习任务的最佳组合",
