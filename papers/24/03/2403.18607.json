    "translated_abstract": "联合神经形态学学习（FedNL）利用事件驱动的脉冲神经网络和联合学习框架来有效执行智能分析任务，涉及分布式低功耗设备的大量数据，但同时也容易受到毒化攻击的影响。传统深度神经网络面临的后门攻击威胁通常来自于时间不变的数据。然而，在FedNL中，未知的威胁可能隐藏在时变的脉冲信号中。本文开始探索基于FedNL系统概念的一种新型脆弱性，称为“Spikewhisper”，该概念利用时间分割复用，允许攻击者尽可能规避检测，因为多个恶意客户端可以在不同时间片段使用不同的触发器不被察觉地进行毒化。特别地，Spikewhisper的隐蔽性源自于全局触发器的时域可分割性，每个恶意客户端仅粘贴一个本地触发器。",
