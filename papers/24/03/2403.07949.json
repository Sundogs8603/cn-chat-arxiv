    "translated_abstract": "理论计算机科学中算法视角的一个方面是关注其他科学学科的视角，重点放在满足实际约束条件的令人满意的解决方案上，而不是忽略这些约束条件的最优解决方案。算法视角为许多学术领域，包括分子生物学、生态学、神经科学、量子物理学、经济学和社会科学，提供了独特而重要的视角。本论文将算法视角应用于贝叶斯认识论。传统的贝叶斯认识论为个体在接收新信息后如何演化其信念提供了全面的框架。然而，这些方法通常假定了这种信息的详尽模型，包括不同证据之间的相关结构。事实上，个体可能缺乏这样的详尽模型，但仍需要形成信念。除此之外",
    "tldr": "这里是中文总结出的一句话要点: 本论文将算法视角应用于贝叶斯认识论，挑战传统方法在信息不完备情况下的应用，为个体如何演化其信念提供了新的理论视角。",
    "en_tdlr": "Here is the key point of the paper in English: This thesis applies the algorithmic lens to Bayesian epistemology, challenging traditional methods in the presence of incomplete information and providing a new theoretical perspective on how individuals evolve their beliefs."
