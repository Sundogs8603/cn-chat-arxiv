    "translated_abstract": "食物类别的精确识别对智能健康管理至关重要，在近年来引起了广泛的研究关注。著名的基准数据集，如Food-101和VIREO Food-172，提供了丰富的食物图像资源，推动了该领域研究的繁荣发展。然而，这些数据集都是从食堂场景精心策划的，与日常生活中的食物外观有所偏差。这种差异给在这些食堂数据集上训练的分类器有效地转移到人类所遇到的更广泛的日常生活场景中带来了巨大挑战。为此，我们提出了两个新的基准数据集，即DailyFood-172和DailyFood-16，专门设计用于策划来自日常餐点的食物图像。这两个数据集被用来评估方法从精心策划的食物图像领域向日常生活食物图像领域的可转移性。此外，我们还提出了一种简单的方法",
