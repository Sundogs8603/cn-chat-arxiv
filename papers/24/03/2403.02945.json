By identifying subgroups of patients with similar levels of medical resource need, ICUs could be restructured into a collection of smaller subunits, each catering to a specific group. However, it is unclear whether common patient subgroups exist across different ICUs, which would determine whether ICU restructuring could be operationalised in a standardised manner. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that common ICU patient subgroups exist by examining whether the results from one existing study generalise to a different dataset. We extracted 16 features representing medical resource need and used consensus clustering to derive patient subgroups, replicating the previous study.

    "translated_abstract": "使用无监督学习来识别患者亚组已经被提出作为改善重症监护病房（ICU）效率的潜在方向。通过识别具有类似医疗资源需求水平的患者亚组，ICUs可以重组为一系列较小的亚单元，每个单元对应一个特定组。然而，目前尚不清楚是否存在跨不同ICUs共同的患者亚组，这将决定ICU重组是否可以以标准化方式实施。在本文中，我们测试了一个假设：通过检查一个现有研究的结果是否可以推广到不同数据集，来验证是否存在共同的ICU患者亚组。我们提取了代表医疗资源需求的16个特征，并使用共识聚类来得出患者亚组，复制了先前的研究。我们发现我们的结果与先前研究的结果之间存在有限的相似性，提供了...",
