Building on prior work, we introduce a programme of new \"dangerous capability\" evaluations and pilot them on Gemini 1.0 models. Our evaluations cover four areas: (1) persuasion and deception; (2) cyber-security; (3) self-proliferation; and (4) self-reasoning. We do not find evidence of strong dangerous capabilities in the models we evaluated, but we flag early warning signs. Our goal is to help advance a rigorous science of dangerous capability evaluation, in preparation for future models.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了了解新的人工智能系统可能带来的风险，我们必须了解它能做什么，以及不能做什么。在先前的工作基础上，我们引入了一项新的“危险能力”评估计划，并在Gemini 1.0模型上进行试点。我们的评估涵盖四个领域：（1）说服和欺骗；（2）网络安全；（3）自我扩散；和（4）自我推理。我们没有发现我们评估的模型具有强大的危险能力的证据，但我们标记了早期预警信号。我们的目标是推动一个严格的危险能力评估科学，为未来模型做好准备。",
