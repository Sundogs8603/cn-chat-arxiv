    "translated_abstract": "我们引入$r$-loopy Weisfeiler-Leman ($r$-$\\ell{}$WL)，这是一种新颖的图同构测试层次结构以及相应的GNN框架$r$-$\\ell{}$MPNN，该框架可以计数长度最多为$r + 2$的循环。最重要的是，我们展示了$r$-$\\ell{}$WL可以计数仙人掌图的同态。这严格地扩展了经典的1-WL，后者只能计数树的同态，实际上与任意固定的$k$-WL是不可比的。我们在几个合成数据集上经验验证了所提出的$r$-$\\ell{}$MPNN的表达和计数能力，并展示了在各种真实数据集上具有最先进的预测性能。代码可在https://github.com/RPaolino/loopy找到。",
