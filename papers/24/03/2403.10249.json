    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.10249v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The swift evolution of Large-scale Models (LMs), either language-focused or multi-modal, has garnered extensive attention in both academy and industry. But despite the surge in interest in this rapidly evolving area, there are scarce systematic reviews on their capabilities and potential in distinct impactful scenarios. This paper endeavours to help bridge this gap, offering a thorough examination of the current landscape of LM usage in regards to complex game playing scenarios and the challenges still open. Here, we seek to systematically review the existing architectures of LM-based Agents (LMAs) for games and summarize their commonalities, challenges, and any other insights. Furthermore, we present our perspective on promising future research avenues for the advancement of LMs in games. We hope to assist researchers in gaining a clear understanding of the field and to generate more interest in this highly impactful research direction.",

    "translated_abstract": "大规模模型（LMs），不论是以语言为重点还是多模态，迅速发展引起了学术界和工业界的广泛关注。尽管这一快速发展领域引发了极大兴趣，但对其在不同有重大影响的场景中的能力和潜力仍缺乏系统性的综述。本文力图弥合这一差距，对LM在复杂游戏场景中的使用情况进行了彻底的检查并探讨了依然存在的挑战。我们试图系统地审查基于LM的游戏代理（LMAs）的现有架构，并总结它们的共同之处、挑战和任何其他洞见。此外，我们提出了对LM在游戏中进展的有前景的未来研究方向。我们希望协助研究人员更清晰地理解这一领域，并激发对这一高度影响力研究方向的更多兴趣。",
