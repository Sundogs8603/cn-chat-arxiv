However, the aging process and physiological changes, such as memory decline and limited verbal communication, may impede the ability of older adults to recall their memories and life experiences. Given the advanced capabilities of generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems, such as generated conversations and images, and their potential to facilitate the reminiscing process, this study aims to explore the design of generative AI to support music-based reminiscence in older adults.

    "translated_abstract": "基于音乐的回忆有潜力对老年人的心理健康产生积极影响。然而，老化过程和生理变化，如记忆衰退和有限的口头沟通，可能会妨碍老年人回忆他们的记忆和生活经历。鉴于生成人工智能（AI）系统的先进功能，例如生成对话和图像，以及它们促进回忆过程的潜力，本研究旨在探索设计生成AI以支持老年人基于音乐的回忆。",
    "tldr": "本研究通过用户中心设计方法，包括与两名社工和两个设计研讨会（涉及十名老年人）的详细访谈，为深入了解老年人利用生成AI支持基于音乐的回忆的态度作出贡献",
