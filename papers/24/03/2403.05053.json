    "translated_abstract": "图像合成涉及将给定对象无缝地整合到特定的视觉环境中。目前无需训练的方法依赖于从几个采样器中组合注意力权重来引导生成器。然而，由于这些权重来自不同的上下文，它们的组合导致在合成中凝聚混乱和外观信息的丢失。在该任务中，它们过多关注背景生成，即使在这项任务中是不必要的，这些问题恶化。这不仅减慢了推理速度，还损害了前景生成质量。此外，这些方法还在过渡区域引入了不需要的伪影。在本文中，我们将图像合成形式化为一项基于主题的局部编辑任务，仅专注于前景生成。在每一步中，编辑后的前景与噪声背景相结合，以保持场景一致性。为了解决剩下的问题，我们提出了PrimeComposer，一种更快的tr",
