    "translated_abstract": "如何设计一个可以处理非维度数据，并且以异常分数对单点微簇（\"一次性\"异常值）和非单点微簇进行排名的离群点检测器？如何以一种可扩展且“无需干预”的方式获得合理的分数？异常值的微簇指示了欺诈活动中的联合或重复，因此它们的识别是非常可取的。本文提出了一种名为 McCatch 的新算法，通过利用我们提出的“Oracle”图（1NN距离与组1NN距离）来检测微簇。我们研究了31个真实和合成数据集，其中包含高达100万个数据元素，以展示 McCatch 是唯一可以回答上述两个问题的方法；它在性能上优于其他11种方法，特别是当数据具有非单点微簇或为非维度时。我们还展示了 McCatch 在图形、指纹、网络日志中检测有意义微簇的能力。",
