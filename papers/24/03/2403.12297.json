    "translated_abstract": "物质使用障碍（SUD）由于对健康和社会的有害影响而引起了重大关注。 SUD的识别和治疗取决于诸多因素，如严重程度、联合决定因素（例如戒断症状）和健康社会决定因素。 美国保险提供商使用的现有诊断编码系统，如国际疾病分类（ICD-10），对于某些诊断缺乏细致度，但临床医生会将此细致度（如《精神障碍诊断与统计手册》分类或DSM-5中所发现的）作为辅助非结构化文本添加到临床记录中。 传统的自然语言处理（NLP）方法在准确解析这种多样化的临床语言方面存在局限性。 大型语言模型（LLMs）通过适应多样化的语言模式，有望克服这些挑战。 本研究调查了LLMs在提取严重性方面的应用",
