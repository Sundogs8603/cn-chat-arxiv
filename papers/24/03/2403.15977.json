In this work, we propose a machine learning framework inspired by the \"two-stream hypothesis\" and explore the potential benefits that it offers. Specifically, the proposed framework models the following mechanisms: 1) ventral (what) stream focusing on the input regions perceived by the fovea part of an eye (foveation), 2) dorsal (where) stream providing visual guidance, and 3) iterative processing of the two streams to calibrate visual focus and process the sequence of focused image patches.

    "translated_abstract": "基于深度神经网络（DNN）的机器感知框架以一次性方式处理整个输入，以提供“被观察到的物体是什么”和“它位于哪里”这两个问题的答案。相比之下，神经科学中的“双流假设”解释了人类视觉皮层中的神经处理，表明其作为一个利用大脑的两个不同区域来回答“是什么”和“在哪里”的视觉系统。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个受“双流假设”启发的机器学习框架，并探讨了它所带来的潜在好处。具体而言，所提出的框架模拟了以下机制：1）腹侧（是什么）流聚焦于眼球（眼底）的视野部分，2）背侧（在哪里）流提供视觉引导，3）两个流的迭代处理以校准视觉焦点并处理一系列聚焦的图像块。该框架的训练...",
