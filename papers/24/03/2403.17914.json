To better use those reports, we need to understand the most important events or impact factors according to the accident reports. However, the increasing number of accident reports requires large efforts from domain experts to label those reports. In order to make the labeling process more efficient, many researchers have started developing algorithms to identify the underlying events from accident reports automatically. This article argues that we can identify the events more accurately by leveraging the event taxonomy. More specifically, we consider the problem a hierarchical classification task where we first identify the coarse-level information and then predict the fine-level information. We achieve this hierarchical classification process by incorporating a novel hierarchical attention module into BERT. To further ",

    "translated_abstract": "在航空领域记录了大量的事故报告，提高航空安全至关重要。为更好地利用这些报告，我们需要根据事故报告了解最重要的事件或影响因素。然而，不断增加的事故报告数量要求领域专家投入大量工作来标记这些报告。为了使标记过程更加高效，许多研究人员已开始开发算法，自动从事故报告中识别潜在的事件。本文认为，通过利用事件分类法，我们可以更准确地识别事件。具体来说，我们将这一问题视为一项分层分类任务，在此过程中首先识别粗粒度信息，然后预测细粒度信息。我们通过将一种新颖的分层注意力模块整合到BERT中实现了这种分层分类过程。",
