We use Lean, a theorem proving framework, to address these challenges. By formalizing logical reasoning problems into theorems within Lean, we can solve them by proving or disproving the corresponding theorems. This method reduces the risk of logical inconsistencies with the help of Lean's symbolic solver. It also enhances our ability to treat complex reasoning tasks by using Lean's extensive library of theorem proofs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FOLIO dataset and achieves performance near this level on ProofWriter. Notably, these results were accomplished by fine-tuning on fewer than 100 in-domain samples for each dataset.",

    "translated_abstract": "大语言模型（LLMs）通常由于逻辑不一致性和推理困难而面临复杂的逻辑推理问题。我们使用Lean，一个定理证明框架，来解决这些挑战。通过在Lean中将逻辑推理问题形式化为定理，我们可以通过证明或证伪相应的定理来解决它们。这种方法通过Lean的符号求解器减少了逻辑不一致性的风险。它还通过使用Lean的广泛定理证明库增强了我们处理复杂推理任务的能力。我们的方法在FOLIO数据集上实现了最先进性能，并在ProofWriter数据集上接近了这一水平。值得注意的是，这些结果是在每个数据集的少于100个领域内样本进行微调后实现的。",
