    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了新颖的方法，涉及生成对抗网络和扩散模型，以合成高质量的真实和伪造指纹图像，同时保留独特性和多样性等特征。我们使用各种方法从噪声中生成真实指纹，并利用图像转换技术将真实指纹图像转换成伪造指纹。为了基于有限训练数据生成不同类型的伪造图像，我们结合了风格转移技术，通过配备Wasserstein度量和梯度惩罚的循环自动编码器(CycleWGAN-GP)来避免模式崩溃和不稳定性。当伪造训练数据包含明显的伪造特征时，我们发现会导致改进的真实到伪造的转换。我们主要通过Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID)和False Acceptance Rate (FAR)来评估生成的真实指纹图像的多样性和逼真程度。",
