    "translated_abstract": "在这个充满活力的建筑行业中，传统的机器人集成主要集中在自动化特定任务，通常忽略了建筑工作流程中人类因素的复杂性和变化性。本文提出了一种以人为本的方法，设计了一个“工作伴侣漫游器”，旨在协助建筑工人完成其现有实践，旨在增强安全性和工作流程的流畅性，同时尊重建筑劳动的技术性质。我们对在木工模板工程中部署机器人系统进行了深入研究，展示了一个原型，通过环境相关的强化学习（RL）驱动模块化框架，重点强调了在动态环境中的机动性、安全性和舒适的工人-机器人协作。我们的研究推进了机器人在建筑中的应用，倡导协作模型，其中自适应机器人支持而不是取代人类，强调了交互式的潜力。",
