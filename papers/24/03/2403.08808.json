    "translated_abstract": "各种动物利用环境线索展现了准确导航的能力。地球的磁场已被证明是长距离动物迁徙中可靠的信息来源。受动物导航的启发，本文提出了一种用于长距离水下导航的仿生和数据驱动方法。所提出的方法利用测量的地磁数据进行导航，无需GPS系统或地理地图。特别地，我们构建和训练了一个基于时间注意力的长短期记忆（TA-LSTM）网络，用于在导航过程中预测航向角。为了减轻地磁异常的影响，我们开发了一种机制，基于最大似然估计来检测和量化异常。我们将开发的机制与TA-LSTM集成，并校准预测的航向角以增强对地磁异常的抵抗能力。利用从WMM模型获取的数据，我们进行了数值模拟。",
