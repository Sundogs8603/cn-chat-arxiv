    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.11680v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this study, we explore a range of options and outcomes associated with using different allocation approaches to operationalise the Planetary Boundaries (PB) framework at the country, sector, and city scales. We demonstrate: (i) how to translate the PB framework into various sub-global scales (countries, cities, industries); and (ii) how to take global/local aspects (e.g., water use at the watershed level) into account. Finally, we apply the proposed methodology to derive country, city, and sector-specific budgets consistent with the PB concept for Switzerland. We then benchmark the translated PBs for climate, biodiversity, and freshwater use against actual environmental pressures in Switzerland from both production- and consumption-based perspectives. This effectively enables us to provide a comprehensive assessment of whether Switzerland is living within its safe operating space.",
