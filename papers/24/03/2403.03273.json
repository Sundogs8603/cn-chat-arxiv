    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型已经成为医学图像分割的基石，但其有效性取决于大量手动标记的数据集的可用性，其适应性到未知类别仍然是一个挑战。少样本分割（FSS）通过赋予模型从有限标记示例中学习新类别的能力，提供了一个有前途的解决方案。一种领先的FSS方法是ALPNet，它比较查询图像和少量可用支持分割图像之间的特征。关于使用ALPNet的一个关键问题是如何设计其特征。在这项工作中，我们深入探讨了使用DINOv2的特征的潜力，DINOv2是计算机视觉中一种基础的自监督学习模型。利用ALPNet的优势并利用DINOv2的特征提取功能，我们提出了一种新颖的少样本分割方法，不仅提高了性能，还为更多创新铺平了道路。",
