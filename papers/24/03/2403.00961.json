However, many educators may lack the necessary training and expertise in data science to teach these skills. To address this gap, we created the Data Science Education Community of Practice (DSECOP), bringing together graduate students and physics educators from different institutions and backgrounds to share best practices and lessons learned in integrating data science into undergraduate physics education.

    "translated_abstract": "随着各种数据集的日益丰富，从小规模实验数据点到大型复杂数据存储库和强大的数据分析工具，物理教育工作者越来越重视装备他们的学生有效处理数据的能力。然而，许多教育工作者可能缺乏教授这些技能所需的数据科学培训和专业知识。为了解决这一差距，我们建立了数据科学教育实践社区（DSECOP），汇集了不同院校和背景的研究生和物理教育工作者，分享整合数据科学到大学物理教育中的最佳实践和经验教训。在本文中，我们介绍了这个实践社区的见解和经验，突出了在将数据科学纳入初级物理课程中的关键策略和挑战。我们的目标是提供指导和ins",
