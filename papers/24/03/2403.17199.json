    "translated_abstract": "背景：社会支持（SS）和社会孤立（SI）是与精神病学结果相关的健康社会决定因素（SDOH）。在电子健康记录（EHRs）中，个体级SS/SI通常被记录为叙述性临床笔记，而不是结构化编码数据。自然语言处理（NLP）算法可以自动化数据提取的劳动密集型过程。数据与方法：来自Mount Sinai Health System（MSHS，n=300）和Weill Cornell Medicine（WCM，n=225）的精神病学会诊笔记被注释，并建立了一个黄金标准语料库。开发了一个涉及词汇表的基于规则的系统（RBS）和使用FLAN-T5-XL的大型语言模型（LLM）来识别SS和SI的提及及其子类别（例如，社会网络、工具性支持和孤独）。结果：对于提取SS/SI，RBS在MSHS（0.89 vs. 0.65）和WCM（0.75 vs. 0.51）均获得了更高的宏平均f分数。",
