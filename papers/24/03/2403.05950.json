    "translated_abstract": "在自主导航和增强/虚拟现实场景等多个应用中，准确对3D点云中的物体进行分类是一个重要问题，已成为研究热点。本文提出了一种用于增强现实中的3D物体分类的深度学习策略。该方法是GRU和LSTM的组合。LSTM网络能够很好地学习长期依赖关系，但由于门数量较多，训练时间较长；另一方面，GRU网络性能较弱于LSTM，但其训练速度远高于LSTM，这是由于其门数量较少。该方法利用了这两种网络的速度和准确性的组合。提出的方法在包含八个类别（未标记、人造地形、自然地形、高植被、低植被、建筑、硬景观）的4,499,0641个点数据集中实现了0.99的准确率。",
