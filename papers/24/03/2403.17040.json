In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates attention mechanisms with SNNs to improve graph representation learning.

    "translated_abstract": "图表示学习已经成为机器学习和数据挖掘中的关键任务，因为它具有对社交网络、化合物和生物系统等复杂结构进行建模的潜力。最近，脉冲神经网络（SNNs）作为传统神经网络用于图学习任务的一种有前途的替代方案而出现，因为它们能够高效地编码和处理时间和空间信息。在本文中，我们提出了一种将注意力机制与SNNs结合以改善图表示学习的新方法。具体来说，我们引入了一种用于SNN的注意力机制，可以在学习过程中有选择地关注图中重要的节点和相应特征。我们在几个基准数据集上评估了我们提出的方法，并展示了它与现有图学习技术相比具有可比较的性能。",
