    "translated_abstract": "传统的心理健康研究方法采用广义线性模型(GLM)描述观察到的心理行为测量数据(问卷摘要分数)的纵向动态。类似地，GLM也被应用于表征神经生物测量数据(区域fMRI信号)与感知刺激或其他区域信号之间的关系。虽然这些方法对于探索那些构造的独立信号之间的线性相关性(即，总分或fMRI信号)是有用的，但这些经典框架在提供关于可观察变化背后的系统级动态的洞察方面存在不足。隐藏马尔可夫模型(HMM)是一种统计模型，使我们能够描述多个可观测构造之间的顺序关系，并且当通过有限状态自动机(FSA)的视角应用时，可以提供一个更综合和直观的框架来建模和理解。",
