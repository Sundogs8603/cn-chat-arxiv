    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.03642v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Recently, with increasing interest in pet healthcare, the demand for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems in veterinary medicine has increased. The development of veterinary CAD has stagnated due to a lack of sufficient radiology data. To overcome the challenge, we propose a generative active learning framework based on a variational autoencoder. This approach aims to alleviate the scarcity of reliable data for CAD systems in veterinary medicine. This study utilizes datasets comprising cardiomegaly radiograph data. After removing annotations and standardizing images, we employed a framework for data augmentation, which consists of a data generation phase and a query phase for filtering the generated data. The experimental results revealed that as the data generated through this framework was added to the training data of the generative model, the frechet inception distance consistently decreased from 84.14 to 50.75 on the radiograph.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，随着人们对宠物健康的兴趣增加，兽医学中计算辅助诊断（CAD）系统的需求也在增加。在兽医学CAD的发展中，由于放射数据不足而停滞不前。为了克服这一挑战，我们提出了一个基于变分自动编码器的生成式主动学习框架。这种方法旨在缓解兽医学CAD系统可靠数据的稀缺性。本研究利用包含心脏增大X光数据的数据集。在去除注释并标准化图像后，我们使用了一个数据增强框架，其中包括数据生成阶段和用于过滤生成数据的查询阶段。实验结果表明，随着通过该框架生成的数据被添加到生成模型的训练数据中，frechet入侵距离在X光上持续从84.14下降到50.75。",
