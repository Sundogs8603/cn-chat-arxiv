Spinal cord injuries (SCI) can impair hand function, reducing independence. A comprehensive evaluation of function in home and community settings requires a hand grasp taxonomy for individuals with impaired hand function. Developing such a taxonomy is challenging due to unrepresented grasp types in standard taxonomies, uneven data distribution across injury levels, and limited data. This study aims to automatically identify the dominant distinct hand grasps in egocentric video using semantic clustering. Egocentric video recordings collected in the homes of 19 individual with cervical SCI were used to cluster grasping actions with semantic significance.

    "translated_abstract": "手部功能对人类的互动和生活质量至关重要。脊髓损伤（SCI）可能损害手部功能，降低独立性。在家庭和社区环境中对功能进行全面评估需要针对手部功能受损个体的手握分类。由于标准分类中未代表的握持类型、伤害水平间数据分布不均匀和有限数据，开发这样一种分类是具有挑战性的。本研究旨在利用语义聚类自动识别主要的独特手部握持动作，在主体视角视频中。19名颈椎SCI个体家中收集的主体视角视频被用来对具有语义意义的握持动作进行聚类。采用整合姿势和外观数据的深度学习模型来创建个性化的手部分类。定量分析显示，聚类纯度为67.6%+-24.2%，冗余度为18.0%+-21.8%。",
