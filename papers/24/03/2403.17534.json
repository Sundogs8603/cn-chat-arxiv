In this paper, we propose a new method to extract and explore significant fine-grained grammar patterns and potential syntactic grammar rules from treebanks, in order to create an easy-to-understand corpus-based grammar. More specifically, we extract descriptions and rules across different languages for two linguistic phenomena, agreement and word order, using a large search space and paying special attention to the ranking order of the extracted rules. For that, we use a linear classifier to extract the most salient features that predict the linguistic phenomena under study. We associate statistical information to each rule, and we compare the ranking of the model's res",

    "translated_abstract": "描述性语法非常有价值，但编写它们很耗时且困难。此外，尽管语言学家通常使用语料库来创建它们，语法描述通常缺乏定量数据。至于形式化语法，其解释可能具有挑战性。在本文中，我们提出了一种新方法，用于从树库中提取和探索显著的细粒度语法模式和潜在的句法语法规则，以创建一个易于理解的基于语料库的语法。更具体地，我们使用线性分类器从不同语言中提取两种语言现象，即协议和词序，的描述和规则，使用大量的搜索空间并特别关注提取规则的排序顺序。为此，我们使用线性分类器提取最显著的特征，以预测所研究的语言现象。我们为每个规则关联统计信息，并比较模型结果的排名。",
