To tackle this challenge head-on, we introduce FakeWatch, a comprehensive framework carefully designed to detect fake news.

    "translated_abstract": "在当今技术驱动的世界中，假新闻的迅速传播，特别是在选举等重要事件期间，对信息的完整性构成了越来越大的威胁。为了应对这一挑战，我们引入了FakeWatch，一个精心设计用于检测假新闻的全面框架。利用新策划的北美选举相关新闻文章数据集，我们构建了强大的分类模型。我们的框架整合了一个模型中心，包括传统机器学习（ML）技术和尖端语言模型（LMs），以有效地识别假新闻。我们的总体目标是为研究界提供适应性和精准的分类模型，能够识别不断演变的误信息格局。对我们数据集上假新闻分类器进行的定量评估显示，尽管最先进的LMs稍微领先传统ML模型，但是...",
