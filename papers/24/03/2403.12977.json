We train and evaluate SportsNGEN on a large database of professional tennis tracking data and demonstrate that by combining the generated simulations with a shot classifier and logic to start and end rallies, the system is capable of simulating an entire tennis match. In addition, a generic version of SportsNGEN can be customized to a specific player by fine-tuning on match data that includes that player. We show that our model is well calibrated and can be used to derive insights for coaches and broadcasters by evaluating counterfactual or what if options. Finally, we show qualitative results indicating the same approach works for football.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于Transformer解码器的模型SportsNGEN，该模型经过训练使用运动员和球追踪序列，能够生成逼真且持续的游戏场景。我们在大量专业网球追踪数据上训练和评估SportsNGEN，并展示通过将生成的模拟与射击分类器和逻辑相结合来开始和结束球赛，系统能够模拟整个网球比赛。此外，SportsNGEN的通用版本可以通过在包含该球员的比赛数据上微调来定制特定球员。我们展示了我们的模型经过良好校准，可以通过评估反事实或假设选项为教练和广播员提供洞察力。最后，我们展示了质量结果表明相同的方法适用于足球。",
