    "translated_abstract": "在一般和Markov博弈中有效地学习具有大状态和动作空间的均值平衡，同时克服多方代理的困境是一个具有挑战性的问题。最近的研究尝试通过使用独立线性函数类来逼近每个智能体的边际$Q$值来解决这个问题。然而，在这样一个框架下现有的样本复杂度界限对所需精度$\\varepsilon$或动作空间具有次优依赖性。在本工作中，我们引入了一种新算法，Lin-Confident-FTRL，用于学习具有局部对模拟器的访问权限的粗粒度相关均衡（CCE），即可以与访问状态的基础环境进行交互。在对状态空间大小进行对数相关性的同时，Lin-Confident-FTRL学习$\\epsilon$-CCE，并获得具有备份的最佳精度界限$O(\\epsilon^{-2})，同时消除了对动作空间的线性依存关系，同时以多项式方式扩展",
