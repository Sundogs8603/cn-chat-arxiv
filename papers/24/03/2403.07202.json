This framework uses a new cognitively motivated parser, SPAWN, to generate quantitative priming predictions from theoretical syntax and evaluate these predictions with empirical human behavior. As a case study, we apply this framework to study reduced relative clause representations in English. We use SPAWN to generate priming predictions from two theoretical accounts which make different assumptions about the structure of relative clauses.

    "translated_abstract": "结构启动是一种广泛使用的心理语言学范式，用于研究人类句子表征。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个框架，用于利用实证启动模式来建立理论，描述人类处理句子时构建的结构表征。该框架使用一种新的认知驱动解析器SPAWN，根据理论句法生成量化启动预测，并用实证人类行为评估这些预测。作为一个案例研究，我们应用这一框架来研究英语中简化的定语从句表征。我们使用SPAWN从两个理论解释中生成启动预测，这两个解释对定语从句的结构做出了不同的假设。我们发现，仅有一个理论（参与式-相位）的预测与实证启动模式一致，从而突出显示出哪些对定语从句的假设更好地捕捉了人类句子表征",
