    "translated_abstract": "论点挖掘（AM）被定义为自动识别和提取论证组成部分（如前提、主张等）并检测它们之间的关系（即支持、反驳、无关系）的任务。深度学习模型使我们能够比传统方法更有效地分析论点并提取它们的语义。本文介绍了在论点挖掘中几种基于深度学习的模型的比较研究。该工作集中在论点分类上。研究是在广泛的数据集（Args.me, UKP, US2016）上进行的。本文的主要创新点是基于BERT架构的集成模型和作为微调模型的ChatGPT-4。提出的结果显示，BERT+ChatGPT-4在表现上优于其他基于Transformer和LSTM的模型。观察到的改进在大多数情况下大于10。",
