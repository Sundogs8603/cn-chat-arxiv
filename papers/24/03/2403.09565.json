One of these activities is \"Hazard Analysis & Risk Assessment\" (HARA), which is an essential step to start the safety requirements specification. As a potential approach to increase the speed of this step in SafetyOps, we have delved into the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).   Our objective is to systematically assess their potential for application in the field of safety engineering.

    "translated_abstract": "DevOps在许多行业中都是必不可少的，包括自动驾驶汽车的发展。在这些设置中，有一些迭代活动减慢了SafetyOps周期的速度。其中之一是“危险分析与风险评估”（HARA），这是开始安全要求规范的重要步骤。作为增加SafetyOps中这一步速度的潜在途径，我们深入探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的能力。我们的目标是系统评估它们在安全工程领域的应用潜力。为此，我们提出了一个框架，支持使用LLMs更高程度的自动化HARA。尽管我们努力自动化尽可能多的流程，但专家审查仍然至关重要，以确保分析结果的有效性和正确性，并相应进行必要的修改。",
