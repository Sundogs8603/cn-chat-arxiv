    "translated_abstract": "主动学习旨在选择最小量的数据来训练一个与整个数据集训练的模型表现相似的模型。本文研究了主动学习在水下基础设施检验任务中图像分割中的潜力，这里通常需要收集大量的数据。管道检测图像通常在语义上是重复的，但质量却存在很大变化。我们使用互信息作为采集函数，通过蒙特卡洛dropout计算。为了评估该框架的有效性，我们使用CamVid数据集对DenseNet和HyperSeg进行了主动学习训练。此外，我们使用一个包含超过50,000张图像的管道检测数据集对HyperSeg进行训练。对于管道数据集，HyperSeg在使用12.5% 数据时实现了 67.5%的meanIoU，而在同样数量的随机选择图像的情况下仅为61.4%。这表明使用主动学习对分割模型进行训练是有效的。",
