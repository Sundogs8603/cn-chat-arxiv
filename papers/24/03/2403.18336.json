    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.18336v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: User-generated data sources have gained significance in uncovering Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), with an increasing number of discussions occurring in the digital world. However, the existing clinical corpora predominantly revolve around scientific articles in English. This work presents a multilingual corpus of texts concerning ADRs gathered from diverse sources, including patient fora, social media, and clinical reports in German, French, and Japanese. Our corpus contains annotations covering 12 entity types, four attribute types, and 13 relation types. It contributes to the development of real-world multilingual language models for healthcare. We provide statistics to highlight certain challenges associated with the corpus and conduct preliminary experiments resulting in strong baselines for extracting entities and relations between these entities, both within and across languages.",

    "translated_abstract": "用户生成的数据来源在揭示药物不良反应（ADRs）方面变得越来越重要，数字世界中的讨论数量也在增加。然而，现有的临床语料库主要围绕英文科学文章展开。本研究提出了一个包括德语、法语和日语中关于ADR的文本的多语言语料库，来源包括患者论坛、社交媒体和临床报告。我们的语料库包含了12种实体类型、四种属性类型和13种关系类型的注释。这有助于为医疗保健开发现实世界的多语言语言模型。我们提供了一些统计数据以凸显与语料库相关的某些挑战，并进行了初步实验，为在单一语言内部和跨语言之间提取实体和实体之间关系提供了强大的基线。",
