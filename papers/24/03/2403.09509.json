    "translated_abstract": "安全分析用于在安全相关功能的设计阶段识别危险并建立知识。这在复杂的AI-enabled和软件密集型系统如自主驾驶中尤为重要。系统论过程分析 (STPA) 是一种新颖方法，应用于防御和航空航天等安全相关领域，也在汽车行业中日益流行。然而，STPA 假设在具有分布式系统开发和多抽象设计层次的汽车系统工程中并非完全有效。这将阻碍软件开发人员使用STPA分析他们的软件作为更大系统的一部分，导致缺乏可追溯性。这可以看作是持续开发和部署中的可维护性挑战 (DevOps)。本文首先比较了面向汽车行业的STPA的不同指南，例如J31887/ISO21448/STPA手册。",
