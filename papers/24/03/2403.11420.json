In this paper, we provide a novel map with which a wide class of quantum mechanical systems can be cast into the form of a neural network with a statistical summation over network parameters. Our simple idea is to use the universal approximation theorem of neural networks to generate arbitrary paths in the Feynman's path integral. The map can be applied to interacting quantum systems / field theories, even away from the Gaussian limit. Our findings bring machine learning closer to the quantum world.",

    "translated_abstract": "已经提出，接近高斯过程的随机宽神经网络是围绕高斯固定点的量子场论。在本文中，我们提供了一种新颖的映射，通过该映射，可以将一大类量子力学系统表达为具有对网络参数的统计求和形式的神经网络。我们的简单思想是利用神经网络的通用逼近定理生成费曼路径积分中的任意路径。这种映射可以应用于相互作用的量子系统/场论，即使远离高斯极限。我们的发现使机器学习与量子世界更加接近。",
