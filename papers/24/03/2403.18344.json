Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information in natural language as prompts for input into the LLM and employing a supervised fine-tuning technique to tailor the LLM specifically for our lane change prediction task.

    "translated_abstract": "为了确保在动态环境中安全驾驶，自动驾驶车辆应具备准确预测周围车辆车道变换意图并预测其未来轨迹的能力。本文通过提出LC-LLM，一个可解释性车道变换预测模型，利用大型语言模型（LLM）的强大推理能力和自我解释能力来解决现有运动预测方法在长期预测准确性和可解释性方面存在的问题。我们将车道变换预测任务重新构建为一个语言建模问题，通过自然语言处理异构驾驶场景信息作为LLM的输入提示，并使用监督微调技术专门为我们的车道变换预测任务定制LLM。这使我们能够利用LLM的强大功能",
