    "translated_title": "云迁移中SQL方言的转换",
    "translated_abstract": "从现场到云的系统迁移是许多工业机构的重要工作。这种云迁移的关键组成部分是将数据库转移到在线主机。在这项工作中，我们考虑了SQL数据库的迁移困难。尽管SQL是存储数据库程序的显著方法之一，但存在着大量不同的SQL方言（例如MySQL，Postgres等），当现场的SQL方言与云上托管的方言不同时，这可能会使迁移复杂化。一些常见云提供商如AWS和Azure提供了工具来帮助在方言之间进行转换，以减轻大部分困难。然而，这些工具并不成功地转换 100% 的代码。因此，软件工程师必须手动转换未翻译数据库的其余部分。对于大型组织，这项任务很快变得棘手。",
    "tldr": "本文讨论了云迁移中SQL数据库方言的转换困难，尽管有一些工具可以帮助转换方言，但并不能完全解决问题，需要人工干预。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper discusses the challenges of translating SQL database dialects during cloud migration, where tools from cloud providers can only partially mitigate the issue, necessitating manual intervention."
