    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.03058v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel inferential procedure assisted by machine learning based adjustment for randomized control trials. The method was developed under the Rosenbaum's framework of exact tests in randomized experiments with covariate adjustments. Through extensive simulation experiments, we showed the proposed method can robustly control the type I error and can boost the inference efficiency for a randomized controlled trial (RCT). This advantage was further demonstrated in a real world example. The simplicity and robustness of the proposed method makes it a competitive candidate as a routine inference procedure for RCTs, especially when the number of baseline covariates is large, and when nonlinear association or interaction among covariates is expected. Its application may remarkably reduce the required sample size and cost of RCTs, such as phase III clinical trials.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的推断程序，该程序采用了基于机器学习的调整方法，用于随机对照试验。该方法是在罗森鲍姆的基于协变量调整的随机实验的确切检验框架下开发的。通过大量的模拟实验，我们展示了所提出的方法可以稳健地控制第一类错误，并可以提高随机对照试验(RCT)的推断效率。这一优势在一个真实案例中进一步得到了证明。所提出方法的简单性和稳健性使其成为一种竞争性候选作为RCT的常规推断程序，特别是当基线协变量的数量较多，且预计存在非线性关联或协变量之间的交互作用时。其应用可以显著降低RCT的所需样本量和成本，例如三期临床试验。",
