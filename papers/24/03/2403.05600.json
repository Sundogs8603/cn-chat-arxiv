To address this issue, we propose Density-Regression, a method that leverages the density function in uncertainty estimation and achieves fast inference by a single forward pass. We prove it is distance aware on the feature space, which is a necessary condition for a neural network to produce high-quality uncertainty estimation under distribution shifts. Empirically, we conduct experiments on regression tasks with the cubic toy dataset, benchmark UCI, weather forecast with time series, and depth estimation under real-world shifted applications.

    "translated_abstract": "现代深度合奏技术通过使用不同模型的多次前向传递实现强大的不确定性估计性能。然而，这样做会占用大量存储空间并且推断（测试）时间较慢。为了解决此问题，我们提出了一种称为密度回归的方法，该方法在不确定性估计中利用密度函数，通过单次前向传递实现快速推断。我们证明它在特征空间上具有距离感知，这是神经网络产生高质量不确定性估计的必要条件。在实证方面，我们在立方体玩具数据集、基准UCI数据集、具有时间序列的天气预测和真实世界偏移应用下的深度估计等回归任务上进行了实验。我们展示了在分布偏移下，密度回归与现代深度回归器相比具有竞争力的不确定性估计性能，同时使用的模式较低。",
