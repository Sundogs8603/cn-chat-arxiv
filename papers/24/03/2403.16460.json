In this paper, we propose an adaptive CFL framework, named FedAC, which (1) efficiently integrates global knowledge into intra-cluster learning by decoupling neural networks and utilizing distinct aggregation methods for each submodule, significantly enhancing performance; (2) includes a costeffective online model similarity metric based on dimensionality reduction; (3) incorporates a cluster number fine-tuning module for improved adaptability and scalability in complex,",
