They can emphasize or clarify emotions, add details to conversations, or simply serve decorative purposes. This casual use, however, barely scratches the surface of the expressive power of emoji. To further unleash this power, we present Emojinize, a method for translating arbitrary text phrases into sequences of one or more emoji without requiring human input. By leveraging the power of large language models, Emojinize can choose appropriate emoji by disambiguating based on context (eg, cricket-bat vs bat) and can express complex concepts compositionally by combining multiple emoji (eq, ''Emojinize'' is translated to input-latin-letters right-arrow grinning-face). In a cloze test--based user study, we show that Emojinize's emoji translations increase the human guessability of masked words by 55%, whereas human-picked emoji translations do so by only 29%.

    "translated_abstract": "Emoji已经成为书面交流中无处不在的存在，在网络上和更远的地方。它们可以强调或澄清情绪，为对话增添细节，或者简单地起装饰作用。然而，这种随意使用仅仅是表情符号表达能力的冰山一角。为了进一步释放这种力量，我们提出了Emojinize，一种将任意文本短语翻译成一个或多个表情符号序列的方法，而无需人类输入。通过利用大型语言模型的能力，Emojinize可以根据上下文（例如，板球-球棒vs蝙蝠）消除歧义地选择适当的表情符号，并通过组合多个表情符号（例如，“Emojinize”被翻译成输入-拉丁文字母-右箭头-笑脸）来组合表达复杂概念。在基于填空测试的用户研究中，我们表明Emojinize的表情符号翻译可以使掩盖的单词的猜测性增加55％，而人类选择的表情符号翻译只能增加29％。",
