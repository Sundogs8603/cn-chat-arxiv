This paper presents an innovative OIE model, APRCOIE, tailored for Chinese text. Diverging from previous models, our model generates extraction patterns autonomously. The model defines a new pattern form for Chinese OIE and proposes an automated pattern generation methodology. In that way, the model can handle a wide array of complex and diverse Chinese grammatical phenomena. We design a preliminary filter based on tensor computing to conduct the extraction procedure efficiently. To train the model, we manually annotated a large-scale Chinese OIE dataset. In the comparative evaluation, we demonstrate that APRCOIE outperforms state-of-the-art Chinese OIE models and significantly expands the boundaries of achievable OIE performance.

    "translated_abstract": "开放信息抽取（OIE）旨在从自然语言文本中提取表面关系及其对应的参数，而不考虑领域。本文提出了一种针对中文文本的创新型OIE模型APRCOIE。与先前的模型不同，我们的模型可以自主生成抽取模式。该模型为中文OIE定义了一种新的模式形式，并提出了自动化的模式生成方法。通过这种方式，模型可以处理多样复杂的中文语法现象。我们基于张量计算设计了一个初步过滤器，以便高效地进行抽取过程。为了训练模型，我们手动标注了一个大规模的中文OIE数据集。在比较评估中，我们展示了APRCOIE优于最先进的中文OIE模型，并显著拓展了可实现的OIE性能边界。APRCOIE的代码和标注数据集已发布。",
