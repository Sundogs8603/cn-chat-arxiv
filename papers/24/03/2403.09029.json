Despite the advancements in VLMs for various tasks, the specific challenge of converting a screenshot into a corresponding HTML has been minimally explored. We posit that this is mainly due to the absence of a suitable, high-quality dataset. This work introduces WebSight, a synthetic dataset consisting of 2 million pairs of HTML codes and their corresponding screenshots. We fine-tune a foundational VLM on our dataset and show proficiency in converting webpage screenshots to functional HTML code. To accelerate the research in this area, we open-source WebSight.",

    "translated_abstract": "在 web 开发中使用视觉-语言模型（VLMs）提出了一个有前途的策略，以提高效率并解锁无代码解决方案：通过提供 UI 的屏幕截图或草图，VLM 可以生成复制它的代码，例如以 HTML 语言。尽管 VLMs 在各种任务中取得了进展，但将屏幕截图转换为相应的 HTML 的具体挑战几乎未经探索。我们认为这主要是由于缺乏一个合适的、高质量的数据集。本文介绍了 WebSight，一个由 200 万对 HTML 代码和它们对应的屏幕截图组成的合成数据集。我们在我们的数据集上对基础 VLM 进行微调，并展示了将网页截图转换为功能性 HTML 代码的能力。为了加速该领域的研究，我们开源了 WebSight.",
