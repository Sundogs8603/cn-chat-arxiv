    "translated_abstract": "大邻域搜索（LNS）是一种通用方法，广泛适用且在实践中已被证明在解决优化问题方面非常高效。我们提出将机器学习（ML）整合到LNS中，以帮助决定在每次LNS迭代中应破坏和修复哪些解决方案的部分。我们将新方法称为学习增强的邻域选择（LENS）。我们的方法是普适的，即可应用于任何LNS算法以增强破坏算法的作用。在本文中，我们展示了LENS在基本的带时间窗的车辆路径问题（VRPTW）上的潜力。我们为VRPTW实现了一个LNS算法，并收集了从众所周知、广泛使用的基准数据集衍生出的新颖训练实例的数据。我们用这些数据训练了我们的LENS方法，并将我们的方法的实验结果与两个进行了对比。",
