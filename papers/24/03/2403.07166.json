We show that a possible explanation for the presence of small price changes is related to sales volume, an observation that has been overlooked in the existing literature. Analyzing a large retail scanner price dataset that contains information on both prices and sales volume, we find that small price changes are more frequent when products sales volume is high. This finding holds across product categories, within product categories, and for individual products. It is also robust to various sensitivity analyses such as measurement errors, the definition of small price changes, the inclusion of measures of price synchronization, the size of producers, the time horizon used to compute the average sales volume, the revenues, the competition, shoppers characteristics, etc.",

    "translated_abstract": "许多零售价格数据集中发现小幅价格变动的现象通常被视为一个谜题。我们展示了一个可能的解释，即小幅价格变动存在的一个原因与销售数量有关，这一观察在现有文献中被忽视。通过分析一个包含价格和销售数量信息的大型零售扫描仪价格数据集，我们发现当产品销售数量较高时，小幅价格变动更为频繁。这一发现在产品类别之间、产品类别内部以及单个产品方面都成立，且对于各种敏感性分析都具有稳健性，例如测量误差、小幅价格变动的定义、价格同步度的加入、生产者规模、用于计算平均销售数量的时间跨度、收入、竞争、购物者特征等。",
