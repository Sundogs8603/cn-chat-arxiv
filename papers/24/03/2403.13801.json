    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.13801v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: We demonstrate experimental results with LLMs that address robotics action planning problems. Recently, LLMs have been applied in robotics action planning, particularly using a code generation approach that converts complex high-level instructions into mid-level policy codes. In contrast, our approach acquires text descriptions of the task and scene objects, then formulates action planning through natural language reasoning, and outputs coordinate level control commands, thus reducing the necessity for intermediate representation code as policies. Our approach is evaluated on a multi-modal prompt simulation benchmark, demonstrating that our prompt engineering experiments with natural language reasoning significantly enhance success rates compared to its absence. Furthermore, our approach illustrates the potential for natural language descriptions to transfer robotics skills from known tasks to previously unseen tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们展示了与LLMs一起解决机器人行动规划问题的实验结果。最近，LLMs已经应用于机器人行动规划，特别是使用代码生成方法将复杂的高级指令转换为中级策略代码。相比之下，我们的方法通过获取任务和场景对象的文本描述，通过自然语言推理制定行动规划，并输出坐标级控制命令，从而减少了作为政策的中间表示代码的必要性。我们的方法在多模态提示仿真基准上进行了评估，表明我们的自然语言推理实验显著提高了成功率，与缺席相比。此外，我们的方法展示了自然语言描述有潜力将机器人技能从已知任务转移到以前未见任务。",
