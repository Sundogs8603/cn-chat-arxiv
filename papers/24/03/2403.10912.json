Our project presents an in-depth study and implementation of an image classification system specifically tailored to identify and classify images of Indian cities. Drawing from an extensive dataset, our model classifies images into five major Indian cities: Ahmedabad, Delhi, Kerala, Kolkata, and Mumbai to recognize the distinct features and characteristics of each city/state. To achieve high precision and recall rates, we adopted two approaches. The first, a vanilla Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and then we explored the power of transfer learning by leveraging the VGG16 model. The vanilla CNN achieved commendable accuracy and the VGG16 model achieved a test accuracy of 63.6%. Evaluations highlighted the strengths and potential areas of improvement",
