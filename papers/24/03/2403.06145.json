However, to advance AI R&D, two challenges arise: 1) significant data imbalance, with most data from Europe/America and under 10% from Asia, despite its 60% global population share; and 2) hefty time and investment needed to curate proprietary datasets for commercial use. In response, we established the first commercial medical imaging platform, encompassing steps like: 1) data collection, 2) data selection, 3) annotation, and 4) pre-processing. Moreover, we focus on harnessing under-represented data from Japan and broader Asia, including Computed Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Whole Slide Imaging scans.
