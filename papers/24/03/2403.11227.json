Two types of evidence were required: highlights (extracting relevant spans within the text) and summaries (aggregating evidence into a synthesis). Our work focuses on evaluating Large Language Models (LLM) as opposed to an alternative method that is much more memory and resource efficient. The first approach employs a good old-fashioned machine learning (GOML) pipeline consisting of a tf-idf vectorizer with a logistic regression classifier, whose representative features are used to extract relevant highlights. The second, more resource intensive, uses an LLM for generating the summaries and is guided by chain-of-thought to provide sequences of text indicating clinical markers.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文描述了UniBuc考古团队为CLPsych 2024共享任务所进行的工作，该任务涉及在文本中寻找支持分配的自杀风险水平的证据。需要两种类型的证据：亮点（提取文本中的相关片段）和摘要（将证据聚合成综合）。我们的工作重点是评估大型语言模型（LLM），而不是一种更节省内存和资源的替代方法。第一种方法采用了传统的机器学习（GOML）管道，包括tf-idf向量化器和逻辑回归分类器，其代表性特征用于提取相关的亮点。第二种更消耗资源的方法使用LLM生成摘要，并由思维链指导提供指示临床标记的文本序列。",
