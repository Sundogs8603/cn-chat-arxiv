Researchers have studied their use, but they have only explored those that leverage remote sighted assistants; little is known about applications that use AI to generate their descriptions. Thus, to investigate their use cases, we conducted a two-week diary study where 16 BLV participants used an AI-powered scene description application we designed. Through their diary entries and follow-up interviews, users shared their information goals and assessments of the visual descriptions they received. We analyzed the entries and found frequent use cases, such as identifying visual features of known objects, and surprising ones, such as avoiding contact with dangerous objects.

    "translated_abstract": "“场景描述”应用程序可以帮助盲人和低视力人士在日常生活中理解照片中的视觉内容。研究人员已经研究了这些应用的使用情况，但他们只研究了利用远程有视力助手的应用，对于利用人工智能生成描述的应用知之甚少。因此，为了调查其使用情况，我们进行了为期两周的日记研究，在此期间，16名盲人和低视力参与者使用了我们设计的AI智能场景描述应用。通过他们的日记记录和后续访谈，用户分享了他们的信息目标以及他们收到的视觉描述的评估。我们分析了这些记录，并发现了常见的使用情况，比如识别已知对象的视觉特征，以及一些令人惊讶的情况，比如避免接触危险物体。我们还发现，用户对这些描述的满意度评分相对较低，平均为2.76（标准差=1.49），对满意度的评分为2.43（标准差=1）。",
