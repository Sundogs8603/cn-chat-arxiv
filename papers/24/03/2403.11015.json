Therefore, accurate identification of attractors plays a critical role in determination of the cell fates. On the other hand, in a real biological circuit, genetic/epigenetic alterations as well as varying environmental factors drastically take effect on the location, characteristics, and even the number of attractors. The central question is: Given a temporal gene expression profile of a real gene regulatory network, how can the attractors be robustly identified in the presence of huge amount of uncertainty?
