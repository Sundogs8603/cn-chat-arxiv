    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了BEHAVIOR-1K，这是一个为以人为中心的机器人技术而设计的综合仿真基准测试。BEHAVIOR-1K包括两个组成部分，受到广泛调查结果的指导和启发，调查问题为“你希望机器人为你做什么？”。第一个部分定义了1,000个日常活动，基于50个场景（房屋，花园，餐厅，办公室等），超过9,000个对象带有丰富的物理和语义属性的标注。第二个部分是OMNIGIBSON，这是一个支持这些活动的新颖仿真环境，通过对刚体、可变形体和液体的逼真物理模拟和渲染来实现。我们的实验表明，BEHAVIOR-1K中的活动具有长视野，并依赖于复杂的操作技能，即使是最先进的机器人学习解决方案也面临挑战。为了校准BEHAVIOR-1K的仿真与现实之间的差距，我们提供了一个关于转移方案学习的初步研究。",
