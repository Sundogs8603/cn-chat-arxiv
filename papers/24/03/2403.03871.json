    "translated_abstract": "垂直联邦学习（VFL）是一种新兴的分布式机器学习范式，其中共同实体的不同特征所有者合作学习全局模型而无需共享数据。在VFL中，主机客户端拥有每个实体的数据标签，并基于所有客户端的中间本地表示学习最终表示。因此，主机是一个单点故障，标签反馈可以被恶意客户端用来推断私有特征。要求所有参与者在整个训练过程中保持活跃和值得信赖通常是不切实际的，在受控环境之外完全不可行。我们提出了一种面向VFL的分段学习方法Decoupled VFL（DVFL）。通过在各自的目标上训练每个模型，DVFL允许特征学习和标签监督之间的分散聚合和隔离。具有这些属性，DVFL具有容错性。",
