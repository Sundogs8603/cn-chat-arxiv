Existing approaches to ASTE often complicate the task with additional structures or external data. In this research, we propose a novel tagging scheme and employ a contrastive learning approach to mitigate these challenges. The proposed approach demonstrates comparable or superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art techniques, while featuring a more compact design and reduced computational overhead. Notably, even in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), our method exhibits superior efficacy compared to GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 in a few-shot learning scenarios. This study also provides valuable insights for the advancement of ASTE techniques within the paradigm of large language models.",

    "translated_abstract": "Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) 是细粒度情感分析的一个新兴子任务，旨在从非结构化文本数据中提取结构化的情感三元组。现有的ASTE方法通常通过额外的结构或外部数据来复杂化任务。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种新颖的标记方案，并采用对比学习方法来缓解这些挑战。所提出的方法在与最先进技术的比较中展示出可比甚至更优越的性能，同时具有更紧凑的设计和降低的计算开销。值得注意的是，在大语言模型(LLMs)时代，我们的方法在少样本学习情景下展现出优于GPT 3.5和GPT 4的效果。本研究还为在大语言模型范式下推进ASTE技术提供了宝贵的见解。",
