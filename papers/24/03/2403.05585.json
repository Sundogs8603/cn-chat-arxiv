    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.05585v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: In this research note, we propose a new approach to model the fake news diffusion process within the framework of incomplete information games. In particular, we use nonlinear partial differential equations to represent the phenomenon of plasmon resonance, in which the diffusion of fake news is rapidly amplified within a particular social group or communication network, and analyze its dynamics through a soliton solution approach. In addition, we consider how first mover, second mover, and third mover strategies interact within this nonlinear system and contribute to the amplification or suppression of fake news diffusion. The model aims to understand the mechanisms of fake news proliferation and provide insights into how to prevent or combat it. By combining concepts from the social sciences and the physical sciences, this study attempts to develop a new theoretical framework for the contemporary problem of fake news.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇研究说明中，我们提出了一种新的方法来模拟虚假新闻在不完全信息博弈框架内的扩散过程。具体而言，我们使用非线性偏微分方程来表示悬浮复共振现象，其中虚假新闻的扩散在特定社交群体或通信网络内被迅速放大，并通过孤子解方法分析其动态。此外，我们考虑头部动者、次头动者和第三方干预策略如何在这个非线性系统中相互作用，并对虚假新闻的扩散起到放大或抑制的作用。该模型旨在理解虚假新闻传播机制，并提供防止或打击其的见解。通过结合社会科学和自然科学的概念，本研究试图为当今的假新闻问题开发一个新的理论框架。",
