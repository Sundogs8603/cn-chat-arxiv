    "translated_abstract": "在真实世界的控制设置中，观测空间通常是不必要的高维且受到时间相关噪声的影响。然而，系统的可控动态通常远比原始观测数据的动态简单。因此，学习一个编码器将观测空间映射到一个包含控制相关变量的简化空间是可取的。本文考虑了由Efroni等人（2022年）首次提出的Ex-BMDP模型，该模型将观测可以分解为依赖于动作的潜在状态和独立于动作的时间相关噪声，并形式化了能够解决控制问题的场景。Lamb等人（2022年）提出了“AC-State”方法，用于学习一个编码器，从这些问题中的观测中提取包含完整依赖于动作的潜在状态表示。AC-State是一个多步反向方法，它使用路径中第一个和最后一个状态的编码来预测",
