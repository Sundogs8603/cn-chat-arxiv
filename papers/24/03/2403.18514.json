    "translated_abstract": "无监督的病理性检测可以通过仅在健康数据上训练模型并在推断时测量与训练集的偏差来实现，例如基于CNN的特征提取和单类分类器，或基于重构分数的方法，如自编码器，GAN和扩散模型。 正规化流（NF）具有直接通过可逆架构学习训练样本的概率分布的能力。 我们利用这一性质在一种名为CT-3DFlow的新型3D NF模型中，专门为胸部CT数据中的患者级肺部病理检测进行定制。 我们在健康的3D肺部CT块上进行无监督训练，并检测其对数似然分布的偏差作为异常。 我们从患者的CT扫描中汇总块级似然值，以提供患者级的'正常'/'异常'预测。 使用外分布检测性能进行评估。",
