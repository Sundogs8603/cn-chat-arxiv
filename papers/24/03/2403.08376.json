    "translated_abstract": "聚合物粒子尺寸构成了聚合过程中产品质量的一个关键特征。拉曼光谱是一种已建立且可靠的过程分析技术，可用于在线浓度监测。最近的方法和一些理论考虑显示了拉曼信号与颗粒尺寸之间的相关性，但尚不能精确可靠地从拉曼光谱测量中确定聚合物尺寸。基于此，我们提出了三种替代机器学习工作流程来执行这项任务，其中都涉及扩散映射，这是一种非线性流形学习技术用于降维: (i) 直接从扩散映射，(ii) 替代扩散映射，和 (iii) 符合自动编码器神经网络。我们将这些工作流程应用于包含47个微凝胶（交联聚合物）样本的拉曼光谱数据集，这些样本的直径范围为208nm到483 nm，且其尺寸是通过动态光散射测量得到的。",
