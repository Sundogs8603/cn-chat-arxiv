These typically require a sparse infection signal and use either binary or real-valued entries of O(1). However, existing methods do not allow for inferring viral loads which span many orders of magnitude. We develop a message passing algorithm coupled with a PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) specific noise function to allow accurate inference of realistic viral load signals. This work is in the non-adaptive setting and could open the possibility of efficient screening where viral load determination is clinically important.",

    "translated_abstract": "医学诊断测试可以通过使用池化测试协议显着提高效率。这些协议通常需要稀疏的感染信号，并使用O(1)的二进制或实值条目。然而，现有方法不允许推断涵盖多个数量级的病毒载量。我们开发了一种消息传递算法，结合PCR（聚合酶链反应）特定的噪声函数，以允许准确推断现实病毒载量信号。这项工作是在非自适应设置中进行的，并可能为病毒载量测定在临床上重要的有效筛查提供可能性。",
