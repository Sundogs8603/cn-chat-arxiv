However, existing approaches often suffer from fairness issues, as recommendations tend to be more accurate for patients with common diseases compared to those with rare conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel model called Robust and Accurate REcommendations for Medication (RAREMed), which leverages the pretrain-finetune learning paradigm to enhance accuracy for rare diseases. RAREMed employs a transformer encoder with a unified input sequence approach to capture complex relationships among disease and procedure codes. Additionally, it introduces two self-supervised pre-training tasks, namely Sequence Matching Prediction (SMP) and Self Reconstruction (SR), to learn specialized medication needs and interrelations among clinical codes.

    "translated_abstract": "药物推荐系统在医疗保健领域引起了广泛关注，可以根据患者的临床信息提供定制和有效的药物组合。然而，现有方法往往存在公平性问题，因为相较于患有常见疾病的患者，对于患有罕见病症的患者，推荐往往更准确。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为Robust and Accurate REcommendations for Medication（RAREMed）的创新模型，利用预训练-微调学习范式来增强罕见疾病的准确性。RAREMed采用具有统一输入序列方法的Transformer编码器来捕捉疾病和程序代码之间复杂关系。此外，它引入了两个自监督的预训练任务，即Sequence Matching Prediction（SMP）和Self Reconstruction（SR），来学习专门的药物需求和临床代码之间的相互关系。",
