    "translated_abstract": "引用图像分割（RIS）利用变换器在解释复杂的视觉-语言任务方面取得了巨大成功。然而，二次计算成本使其在捕捉远程视觉-语言依赖性方面消耗资源。幸运的是，Mamba通过高效的线性复杂度在处理方面解决了这个问题。然而，将Mamba直接应用于多模态交互会面临挑战，主要原因是因为通道交互不足，无法有效融合多模态数据。在本文中，我们提出了ReMamber，这是一种整合了Mamba和多模态Mamba Twister块强大功能的新型RIS架构。Mamba Twister通过其独特的通道和空间扭曲机制明确建模图像-文本交互，并通过其独特的通道和空间扭曲机制融合文本和视觉特征。我们在三个具有挑战性的基准测试中取得了最新技术成果。此外，我们对ReMamber进行了彻底分析，并讨论其他...",
