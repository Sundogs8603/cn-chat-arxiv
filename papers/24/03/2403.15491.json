Instead, the evaluation of the knowledge that these models have of the languages has received much less attention. For example, the words that they can recognize and use in different languages. In this paper, we evaluate the knowledge that open-source chat LLMs have of Spanish words by testing a sample of words in a reference dictionary. The results show that open-source chat LLMs produce incorrect meanings for an important fraction of the words and are not able to use most of the words correctly to write sentences with context.

    "translated_abstract": "在对大型语言模型（LLMs），特别是可以与用户进行交互的对话模型的兴趣不断增加的情况下，开发了大量开源聊天LLMs。这些模型在广泛的基准上进行评估，以评估它们在回答问题或解决几乎任何可能的主题上的能力，或者测试它们理解或解释文本的能力。然而，对这些模型对语言的了解的评估却受到了远远较少的关注。例如，它们能够识别和使用不同语言中的单词数。本文通过在参考词典中测试部分单词的样本来评估开源聊天LLMs对西班牙语单词的了解程度。结果显示，开源聊天LLMs对重要部分单词产生了错误的含义，并且无法正确使用大部分单词在上下文中写句子。",
