The key idea is that different practices differ in whether individual data leaves the consumer's machine or not and in how they track and target consumers; these affect, respectively, the intrinsic and instrumental components of privacy preferences differently, leading to different PPVs for different practices.

    "translated_abstract": "针对收集和使用个人数据的隐私问题，在线广告行业一直在开发隐私增强技术（PETs），例如谷歌的隐私沙箱计划。本研究利用双重隐私框架来理解消费者对当前和提议的在线广告实践的知觉隐私侵犯（PPVs）。关键思路是，不同实践在个体数据是否离开消费者的设备以及如何跟踪和定位消费者上存在差异；这些不同影响隐私偏好的内在和工具组成部分，在不同实践下导致不同的PPVs。我们进行了针对美国消费者的在线研究，以获取不同广告实践中的PPVs。我们的发现证实了跟踪...",
