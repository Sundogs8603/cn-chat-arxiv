    "translated_abstract": "文献检索已经从大规模预训练语言模型（PLM）的进步中受益良多。然而，它们的有效性在专门领域或行业的主题特定应用中通常受到限制，这是由于独特术语、用户查询的不完整上下文和专门搜索意图导致的。为了捕捉主题特定信息并改进检索，我们提出使用语料库主题分类，该分类概述了语料库的潜在主题结构，同时反映了用户感兴趣的方面。我们介绍了ToTER（增强型主题分类检索）框架，该框架借助分类的指导确定查询和文档的中心主题，并利用它们的主题相关性补充缺失的上下文。作为一种即插即用的框架，ToTER可灵活应用于增强各种基于PLM的检索器。通过对两个案例进行广泛的定量、缺失和探索性实验，我们评估了ToTER框架的性能。",
