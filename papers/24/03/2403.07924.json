    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）领域正在快速发展，具有显著潜力改变社会。然而，它面临着一个明显的挑战：缺乏多样性，这是STEM领域长期存在的问题。本立场论文探讨了人工智能和身份的交叉点，作为理解AI发展和应用中的偏见、不平等和道德考虑的途径。我们提出了一个多维度的AI身份定义，涵盖其创造者、应用以及它们的更广泛影响。理解AI的身份涉及分析参与AI发展的各种个体、所产生的技术以及社会、道德和心理影响。在探讨AI身份生态系统及其社会动态后，我们提出了一个框架，强调了通过身份视角跨三个维度——创造者、创作物和后果，在AI中需要多样性的必要性。",
    "tldr": "该论文探讨了人工智能领域的身份问题，强调了通过身份视角促进AI多样性在创造者、创作物和后果方面的重要性。"
