    "translated_abstract": "大规模水动力模型通常依赖于固定分辨率的空间网格和模型参数，同时会产生高计算成本。这限制了它们准确预测洪水峰值并发布时间关键的危险警告的能力。在这项工作中，我们构建了一个快速、稳定、准确、分辨率不变、几何自适应的洪水建模和预测框架，可以在大规模下运行，名为FloodCast。该框架包括两个主要模块：多卫星观测和水动力建模。在多卫星观测模块中，提出了实时无监督变化检测方法和降雨处理与分析工具，以充分利用多卫星观测在大规模洪水预测中的潜力。在水动力建模模块中，引入了一种几何自适应的物理启发式神经求解器（GeoPINS），受益于不需要训练的要求。",
