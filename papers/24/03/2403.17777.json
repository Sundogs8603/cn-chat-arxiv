This paper shows that the classical measurement error model with independent and additive measurement errors is identified nonparametrically using only two order statistics of repeated measurements. The identification result confirms a hypothesis by Athey and Haile (2002) for a symmetric ascending auction model with unobserved heterogeneity.

    "translated_abstract": "经济数据经常受到测量误差的污染，并受到排名的截断。本文展示了仅使用重复测量的两个序统计量，就可以非参数地确定具有独立和加法测量误差的经典测量误差模型。该识别结果证实了Athey和Haile（2002）提出的关于具有未观测异质性的对称升价拍卖模型的假设。扩展允许异质的测量误差，从而将适用性扩展到其他经验设置，包括非对称拍卖和工资报价模型。我们改编了现有的模拟筛选估计量，并展示了其在有限样本中的表现。",
