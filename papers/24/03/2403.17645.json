A family of fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models for ASR have recently been proposed, which normally build on phonetic-level edit distance algorithms and have shown impressive NEC performance. However, as the named entity (NE) list grows, the problems of phonetic confusion in the NE list are exacerbated; for example, homophone ambiguities increase substantially.

    "translated_abstract": "最近提出了一系列用于ASR的快速轻量级命名实体校正（NEC）模型，通常构建在音素级编辑距离算法基础上，并展现出令人印象深刻的NEC性能。然而，随着命名实体（NE）列表的增加，NE列表中的音素混淆问题变得更加严重；例如，同音异义词的问题大大增加。鉴此，我们提出了一种新颖的描述增强型命名实体校正器（称为DANCER），利用实体描述提供额外信息，以便在ASR转录中为NEC提供辅助减轻音素混淆。",
