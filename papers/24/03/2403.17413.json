Recent work using model ensemble methods based on voting can effectively mitigate over-correction and improve the precision of the GEC system.

In this light, we propose the LM-Combiner, a rewriting model that can directly modify the over-correction of GEC system outputs without a model ensemble. Specifically, we train the model on an over-correction dataset constructed through the proposed K-fold cross inference method, which allows it to directly generate filtered sentences by combining the original and the over-corrected text.

    "translated_abstract": "过度校正是中文语法错误校正（CGEC）任务中的一个关键问题。最近的研究使用基于投票的模型集成方法可以有效缓解过度校正，并提高语法错误校正系统的准确率。然而，这些方法仍然需要几个语法错误校正系统的输出，这不可避免地会导致减少错误召回。基于这一情况，我们提出了LM-Combiner，这是一种可以直接修改语法错误校正系统输出的过度校正的重写模型，而无需进行模型集成。具体而言，我们在一个通过提出的K折交叉推断方法构建的过度校正数据集上训练该模型，使其能够通过结合原始文本和过度校正文本来直接生成过滤后的句子。在推断阶段，我们直接将原始句子和其他系统的输出结果作为输入，然后通过LM-Combiner获得过滤后的句子。对FCGEC数据集的实验结果显示，LM-Combiner明显改善了语法错误校正的准确性和召回率。",
