Our system utilizes pattern recognition to analyze the signals obtained at different positions on the body, by scanning the matrices composed of MCG signals with a 2*2 window. In order to make use of the spatial information of MCG signals, we transform the signals from adjacent small areas into four channels of a dataset. We further transform the data into time-frequency matrices using wavelet transforms and employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification. As a result, our system achieves an accuracy rate of 97.04% in identifying individuals. This finding indicates that the MCG signal holds potential for use in individual identification systems, offering a valuable tool for personalized healthcare management.",
