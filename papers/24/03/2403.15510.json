Human speech can contain a lot of user-sensitive information, such as gender, identity, and sensitive content. New types of security and privacy breaches have thus emerged. Users do not want to expose their personal sensitive information to malicious attacks by untrusted third parties. Thus, the SLU system needs to ensure that a potential malicious attacker cannot deduce the sensitive attributes of the users, while it should avoid greatly compromising the SLU accuracy. To address the above challenge, this paper proposes a novel SLU multi-task privacy-preserving model to prevent both the speech recognition (ASR) and identity recognition (IR) attacks.

    "translated_abstract": "语音语言理解（SLU）是物联网设备中人机交互的关键技术之一，提供了一个易于使用的用户界面。人类的言语可能包含大量用户敏感信息，如性别、身份和敏感内容。因此出现了新型安全和隐私侵犯。用户不希望将个人敏感信息暴露给不可信任的第三方的恶意攻击。因此，SLU系统需要确保潜在的恶意攻击者无法推断出用户的敏感属性，同时又应避免大大损害SLU的准确性。为了解决上述挑战，本文提出了一种全新的SLU多任务隐私保护模型，以防止语音识别（ASR）和身份识别（IR）攻击。该模型使用隐藏层分离技术，使SLU信息仅分布在隐藏层的特定部分。",
