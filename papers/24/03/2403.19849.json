    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于OTA（Over-the-Air）计算的联邦学习（FL）范式崭露头角，利用无线信道的波形叠加特性实现快速模型更新。之前的研究主要集中在\\emph{同质}无线条件下的OTA设备“预缩放器”设计，即设备经历相同的平均路径损耗，导致零偏差解决方案。然而，零偏差设计受到路径损耗最严重的设备的限制，因此在\\emph{异构}无线环境中可能表现不佳。在这种情况下，设计\\emph{有偏}解决方案可能有益，以换取模型更新的方差降低。为了优化这种权衡，我们研究了OTA设备预缩放器的设计，重点关注OTA-FL的收敛性。我们推导了模型“最优性误差”的上界，明确捕捉了偏差和方差对于选择的影响",
