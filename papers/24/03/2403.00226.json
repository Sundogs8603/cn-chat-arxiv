Lexical Semantic Change Detection (SCD) task considers the problem of predicting whether a given target word, $w$, changes its meaning between two different text corpora, $C_1$ and $C_2$. For this purpose, we propose a supervised two-staged SCD method that uses existing Word-in-Context (WiC) datasets. In the first stage, for a target word $w$, we learn two sense-aware encoder that represents the meaning of $w$ in a given sentence selected from a corpus. Next, in the second stage, we learn a sense-aware distance metric that compares the semantic representations of a target word across all of its occurrences in $C_1$ and $C_2$.

    "translated_abstract": "检测词汇的时间语义变化是各种自然语言处理应用的重要任务，必须对时间敏感地进行预测。词汇语义变化检测（SCD）任务考虑在两个不同的文本语料库$C_1$和$C_2$之间预测给定目标词$w$是否改变了含义的问题。为此，我们提出了一种使用现有的Word-in-Context（WiC）数据集的监督两阶段SCD方法。在第一阶段，对于目标词$w$，我们学习了两个感知感知编码器，表示给定语料库中所选句子中$w$的含义。接下来，在第二阶段，我们学习了一种感知感知距离度量，比较目标词在$C_1$和$C_2$中的所有出现的语义表示。对多个SCD基准数据集的实验结果表明，我们提出的方法始终优于所有先前提出的多种语言的SCD方法。",
