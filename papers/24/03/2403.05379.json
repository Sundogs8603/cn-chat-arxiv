    "translated_abstract": "自动疾病诊断使用医学图像分析依赖深度学习，通常需要大量标记数据集进行监督模型训练。急性髓细胞白血病（AML）等疾病由于在单个细胞水平上稀缺且昂贵的标注而面临挑战。多实例学习（MIL）解决了弱标记场景，但通常需要用标记数据训练的强大编码器。在本研究中，我们探索了自监督学习（SSL）作为基于MIL的AML亚型分类的预训练方法，从血涂片中去除了编码器训练期间的标记数据需求。我们研究了三种最先进的SSL方法SimCLR、SwAV和DINO，并将它们的性能与监督预训练进行了比较。我们的研究结果表明，SSL预训练编码器实现了可比较的性能，展示了SSL在MIL中的潜力。这一突破提供了一种经济高效且节约数据的解决方案，",
