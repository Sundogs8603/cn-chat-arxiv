    "translated_abstract": "由于近年来对金融科技（FinTech）的兴趣持续增加，像信用违约预测（CDP）这样的应用正受到重视。在这方面，CDP在评估个人和企业的信用价值方面发挥着至关重要的作用，使贷款人能够就贷款批准和风险管理做出明智决策。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于工作流程的方法来改进CDP，这指的是评估借款人违约其信用义务的概率的任务。该工作流程由多个步骤组成，每个步骤旨在利用机器学习管道中不同技术的优势，从而最好地解决CDP任务。我们采用了一种全面系统的方法，从使用WOE（Weight of Evidence）编码进行数据预处理开始，这是一种确保在一次性数据缩放中剔除异常值、处理缺失值的技术。",
