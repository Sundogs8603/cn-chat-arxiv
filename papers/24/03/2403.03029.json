Such reframing is typically non-trivial and requires multiple rationalization steps to uncover the underlying issue of a negative thought and transform it to be more positive. However, this rationalization process is currently neglected by both datasets and models which reframe thoughts in one step. In this work, we address this gap by augmenting open-source datasets for positive text rewriting with synthetically-generated Socratic rationales using a novel framework called \\textsc{SocraticReframe}. \\textsc{SocraticReframe} uses a sequence of question-answer pairs to rationalize the thought rewriting process. We show that such Socratic rationales significantly improve positive text rewriting for different open-source LLMs according to both",

    "translated_abstract": "将负面情绪重塑为积极思维是几种认知方法到心理健康和心理治疗的核心，大型语言模型解决方案可以使这种重塑更易实现。这种重塑通常并不简单，需要多个理性化步骤来揭示负面思维的潜在问题并使其变得更加积极。然而，目前该理性化过程被数据集和模型忽略，这些数据集和模型在一步中重塑思维。本研究填补了这一差距，通过使用一种名为\"SocraticReframe\"的新框架，通过合成生成的苏格拉底论证，扩充了用于积极文本重写的开源数据集。\"SocraticReframe\"使用一系列问答对来理性化思维重写过程。我们展示了这种苏格拉底论证显著改善了不同开源LLM的积极文本重写。",
