    "translated_abstract": "近年来，动态因子模型作为经济学和金融领域的主要工具崭露头角，特别适用于投资策略。相比传统的静态因子模型，该模型在处理复杂、非线性和嘈杂的市场情况方面有所改进。机器学习的进步，特别是在处理非线性数据方面，进一步增强了资产定价方法。本文介绍了一种开创性的动态因子模型，名为RVRAE。该模型是一种概率方法，解决了市场数据中的时间依赖性和噪声问题。RVRAE巧妙地将动态因子建模原理与深度学习中的变分递归自编码器（VRAE）相结合。RVRAE的一个关键特点是其使用先验-后验学习方法。该方法通过寻找受未来数据启发的最佳后验因子模型，微调模型的学习过程。值得注意的是，RVRAE擅长风险调整。",
