We consider the non-uniform setting where the observed entries are sampled with highly varying probabilities, potentially with different asymptotic scalings. We show that under structured sampling probabilities, it is often better and sometimes optimal to run estimation algorithms on a smaller submatrix rather than the entire matrix.
