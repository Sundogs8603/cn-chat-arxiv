    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.17820v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: We suggest a multilevel model, to represent aggregate train-passing events from the Staffordshire bridge monitoring system. We formulate a combined model from simple units, representing strain envelopes (of each train passing) for two types of commuter train. The measurements are treated as a longitudinal dataset and represented with a (low-rank approximation) hierarchical Gaussian process. For each unit in the combined model, we encode domain expertise as boundary condition constraints and work towards a general representation of the strain response. Looking forward, this should allow for the simulation of train types that were previously unobserved in the training data. For example, trains with more passengers or freights with a heavier payload. The strain event simulations are valuable since they can inform further experiments (including FEM calibration, fatigue analysis, or design) to test the bridge in hypothesised scenarios.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个多层模型，以代表斯塔福德郡桥监测系统中的火车通过事件的聚合情况。我们从简单单元构建了一个综合模型，代表了两种类型通勤火车的应变包络（每列火车通过的）。测量值被处理为一个纵向数据集，并用（低秩近似）分层高斯过程表示。对于组合模型中的每个单元，我们将领域专业知识编码为边界条件约束，并致力于应变响应的一般表示。展望未来，这应该允许对先前在训练数据中未观察到的火车类型进行模拟。例如，乘客更多的火车或运载更重货物的货车。应变事件模拟具有价值，因为它们可以为进一步实验（包括有限元法校准、疲劳分析或设计）提供信息，以在假设的情景下测试桥梁。",
