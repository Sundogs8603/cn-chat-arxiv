Our proposed algorithm guides the exploration toward regions that demonstrate high empirical discrepancy between the observed data and an imperfect prior model of the dynamics derived from side information. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that this strategy explores regions of high discrepancy and accelerates learning while simultaneously reducing model uncertainty. We rigorously prove that our active learning algorithm yields a consistent estimate of the underlying dynamics by providing an explicit rate of convergence for the maximum predictive variance. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on an under-actuated pendulum system and on the half-cheetah MuJoCo environment.",
