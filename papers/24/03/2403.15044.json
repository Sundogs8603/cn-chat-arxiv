With the recent surge in the number of large pre-trained models, combining both multimodal fusion methods and pre-trained model features can achieve outstanding performance in many multimodal tasks. In this paper, we present our approach, which leverages both advantages for addressing the task of Expression (Expr) Recognition and Valence-Arousal (VA) Estimation. We evaluate the Aff-Wild2 database using pre-trained models, then extract the final hidden layers of the models as features. Following preprocessing and interpolation or convolution to align the extracted features, different models are employed for modal fusion. Our code is available at GitHub - FulgenceWen/ABAW6th.",
