    "translated_abstract": "视觉关系检测旨在识别图像中的对象及其关系。以往的方法通过在现有目标检测架构中添加单独的关系模块或解码器来处理此任务。这种分离增加了复杂性，阻碍了端到端训练，限制了性能。我们提出了一种简单且高效的无解码器架构，用于开放词汇的视觉关系检测。我们的模型由基于Transformer的图像编码器组成，将对象表示为标记，并隐含地建模它们的关系。为了提取关系信息，我们引入了一个注意力机制，选择可能形成关系的对象对。我们提供了一个单阶段的训练方法，可以在混合对象和关系检测数据上训练此模型。我们的方法在Visual Genome和大词汇GQA基准测试上实现了最先进的关系检测性能，可实现实时性。",
