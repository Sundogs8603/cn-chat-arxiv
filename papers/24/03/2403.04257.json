    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.04257v1 公告类型：新的 摘要：信息检索（IR）是各种应用中的关键组成部分。最近机器学习（ML）的进展使得ML算法能够整合到IR中，特别是在排名系统中。虽然有大量关于基于ML的排名系统的稳健性的研究，但这些研究在很大程度上忽视了商业电子商务系统，并未建立实际世界和操作查询相关性之间的联系。在本文中，我们提出了关于电子商务排名系统稳健性的第一个系统性测量研究。我们将稳健性定义为语义相同查询的排名结果的一致性。为了定量分析稳健性，我们提出了一种新颖的度量标准，考虑了排名位置和现有度量中缺失的特定项目信息。我们使用来自电子商务零售商的真实数据进行大规模的测量研究，揭示了一个衡量和改进稳健性的开放机会。",
