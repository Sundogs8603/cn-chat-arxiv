The conventional approaches that tackle this problem typically employ an unsupervised learning framework, capturing normality patterns with exclusive normal data during training and identifying deviations as anomalies during testing. However, these methods face critical drawbacks: they either only depend on proxy tasks for general representation without directly pinpointing normal patterns, or they neglect to differentiate between spatial and temporal normality patterns, leading to diminished efficacy in anomaly detection. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal memories-enhanced graph autoencoder (STRIPE).
