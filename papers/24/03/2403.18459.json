    "translated_abstract": "涉及人类和机器人的装配过程是具有挑战性的场景，因为个人活动和共享工作空间的访问必须协调。固定的机器人程序不允许偏离固定协议。在这样的过程中工作可能会让用户感到有压力，并导致行为无效或失败。我们提出了一种新颖的在线基于约束的调度方法，位于支持行为树的反应式执行控制框架中，名为CoBOS。这使得机器人能够适应延迟活动完成和活动选择（由人类）等不确定事件。用户将体验到较少的压力，因为机器人同事会调整其行为以最好地补充人类选择的活动，以完成共同任务。除了改善的工作条件，我们的算法还导致了效率的提高，即使在高度不确定的情况下也是如此。我们使用一个概率性的si来评估我们的算法",
