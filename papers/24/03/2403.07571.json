To counteract this, proactive recommendation actively steers users towards developing new interests in a target item or topic by strategically modulating recommendation sequences. Existing work for proactive recommendation faces significant hurdles: 1) overlooking the user feedback in the guidance process; 2) lacking explicit modeling of the guiding objective; and 3) insufficient flexibility for integration into existing industrial recommender systems.
