This task aims to generate an entire code repository from its natural language requirements. To address this task, we propose a simple yet effective framework CodeS, which decomposes NL2Repo into multiple sub-tasks by a multi-layer sketch. Specifically, CodeS includes three modules: RepoSketcher, FileSketcher, and SketchFiller.
