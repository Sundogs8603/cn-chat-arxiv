    "translated_abstract": "开源开发通过促进协作、透明性和社区驱动的创新，彻底改变了软件行业。如今，大量各种类型的开源软件，形成了网络存储库，通常托管在GitHub上-一种流行的软件开发平台。为了增强存储库网络的可发现性，即相似存储库组，GitHub在2017年引入了存储库主题，使用户更容易按类型、技术等浏览相关项目。因此，准确为每个GitHub存储库分配主题至关重要。目前用于自动主题推荐的方法主要依赖于TF-IDF来对文本数据进行编码，存在理解语义细微差别的挑战。本文通过提出Legion，一种利用预训练语言模型（PTMs）推荐主题的新方法，解决了现有技术的局限性。",
