    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.10707v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to uncovering and analyzing themes in social media messaging. Recognizing the limitations of traditional topic-level analysis, which tends to capture only the overarching patterns, this study emphasizes the need for a finer-grained, theme-focused exploration. Conventional methods of theme discovery, involving manual processes and a human-in-the-loop approach, are valuable but face challenges in scalability, consistency, and resource intensity in terms of time and cost. To address these challenges, we propose a machine-in-the-loop approach that leverages the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach allows for a deeper investigation into the thematic aspects of social media discourse, enabling us to uncover a diverse array of themes, each with unique characteristics and relevance, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of the nuances present within broader topics.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种揭示和分析社交媒体消息主题的新方法。鉴于传统主题级分析的局限性，往往只捕捉到整体模式，本研究强调了对更精细、主题聚焦的探索的需求。传统的主题发现方法，涉及手动流程和人在循环中的方法，具有价值，但在伸缩性、一致性和资源强度方面面临挑战，涉及时间和成本。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLMs）先进功能的机器在循环中方法。这种方法允许更深入地调查社交媒体话语的主题方面，使我们能够揭示多样的主题，每个主题具有独特的特征和相关性，从而提供对更广泛主题内有的微妙细节的全面理解。",
