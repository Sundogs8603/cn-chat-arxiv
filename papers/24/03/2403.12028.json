    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.12028v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: 3D human body reconstruction has been a challenge in the field of computer vision. Previous methods are often time-consuming and difficult to capture the detailed appearance of the human body. In this paper, we propose a new method called \\emph{Ultraman} for fast reconstruction of textured 3D human models from a single image. Compared to existing techniques, \\emph{Ultraman} greatly improves the reconstruction speed and accuracy while preserving high-quality texture details. We present a set of new frameworks for human reconstruction consisting of three parts, geometric reconstruction, texture generation and texture mapping. Firstly, a mesh reconstruction framework is used, which accurately extracts 3D human shapes from a single image. At the same time, we propose a method to generate a multi-view consistent image of the human body based on a single image. This is finally combined with a novel texture mapping method to optimize texture ",

    "translated_abstract": "3D人体重建一直是计算机视觉领域的一个挑战。先前的方法往往耗时且难以捕捉人体的详细外观。本文提出了一种名为“Ultraman”的新方法，用于从单一图像快速重建带有纹理的3D人体模型。与现有技术相比，“Ultraman”极大地提高了重建速度和准确性，同时保留了高质量的纹理细节。我们提出了一套新的人体重建框架，包括几个部分，几何重建、纹理生成和纹理映射。首先使用了一个网格重建框架，准确地从单一图像中提取3D人体形状。同时，我们提出了一种基于单一图像生成多视角一致的人体图像的方法。最后，结合一种新颖的纹理映射方法来优化纹理。",
