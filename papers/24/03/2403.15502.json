In this paper, we study the problem of improving inline autocomplete suggestions in text entry systems via a sequential decision-making formulation, and use reinforcement learning to learn suggestion policies through repeated interactions with a target user over time.

    "translated_abstract": "自动完成建议是现代文本输入系统中的基本功能，应用于诸如消息传递和电子邮件撰写等领域。通常，自动完成建议是从具有置信度阈值的语言模型生成的。然而，这个阈值并没有直接考虑用户因显示建议而施加的认知负荷，例如从输入切换到阅读建议的上下文以及决定是否接受建议的时间。在本文中，我们研究了通过顺序决策制定来改进文本输入系统中的在线自动完成建议问题，并使用强化学习通过随时间与目标用户的重复交互来学习建议策略。这种制定允许我们将认知负荷因素纳入训练自动完成模型的目标中，通过基于文本输入速度的奖励函数。我们获得了理论方面的...",
