Numerous recommendation algorithms, employing strategies such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods, leverage the data mined through these weblogs to provide personalized recommendations to users. Despite the abundance of information available in these weblogs, identifying and extracting pertinent information and key features necessitates extensive engineering endeavors. The intricate nature of the data also poses a challenge for interpretation, especially for non-experts.

    "translated_abstract": "Weblog由记录任何网站上用户活动的记录组成，可以为用户偏好、行为和兴趣提供宝贵的见解。许多推荐算法利用通过这些Weblog挖掘的数据，采用协同过滤、基于内容的过滤和混合方法等策略，为用户提供个性化推荐。本研究引入了一种称为InteraRec的复杂交互式推荐框架，它不同于传统方法，后者仅依赖Weblog生成推荐。该框架捕获用户导航时网页的高频截图。",
