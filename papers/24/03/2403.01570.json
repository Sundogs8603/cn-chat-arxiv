However, LLMs' application on domain-specific vertical questions still lags behind, primarily due to the humiliation problems and deficiencies in vertical knowledge. Furthermore, the vertical data annotation process often requires labor-intensive expert involvement, thereby presenting an additional challenge in enhancing the model's vertical capabilities. In this paper, we propose SERVAL, a synergy learning pipeline designed for unsupervised development of vertical capabilities in both LLMs and small models by mutual enhancement. Specifically, SERVAL utilizes the LLM's zero-shot outputs as annotations, leveraging its confidence to teach a robust vertical model from scratch.

    "translated_abstract": "近期大型语言模型（LLMs）的发展展示出对通用和常识问题卓越的零-shot能力。然而，LLMs在领域特定垂直问题上的应用仍然落后，主要是由于垂直知识方面的问题和不足。此外，垂直数据注释过程通常需要劳动密集型的专家参与，因此增加了增强模型垂直能力的额外挑战。在本文中，我们提出了SERVAL，一个协同学习流水线，旨在通过相互增强，对LLMs和小模型的垂直能力进行无监督开发。具体来说，SERVAL利用LLMs的零-shot输出作为注释，利用其置信度来从头开始教授一个强大的垂直模型。反过来，训练有素的垂直模型引导LLM微调，以增强其零-shot能力，逐步改进两者。",
