In YUIMA, we solve this problem by means of the inverse Fourier transform for simulating the increments of a Student-$t$ L\\'{e}vy defined on a interval with any length. A second problem is due to the fact that joint estimation of trend, scale, and degrees of freedom does not seem to have been investigated as yet.

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在讨论在\\textsf{R}软件包YUIMA中由学生t-Lévy过程驱动的具有恒定标度和任意自由度的线性回归模型的估计和模拟方法。该过程在金融、物理、生物学等多个领域中都有应用。模型存在两个主要问题。第一个问题与在高频率水平模拟样本路径有关，因为仅在单位时间间隔上定义的$t$-Lévy增量才服从学生t分布。在YUIMA中，我们通过逆Fourier变换来模拟在任意长度间隔上定义的学生t-Lévy的增量来解决这个问题。第二个问题是由于尚未对趋势、标度和自由度的联合估计进行研究。在YUIMA中，我们开发了一个有效处理这个问题的两步估计程序。",
