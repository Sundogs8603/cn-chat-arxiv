Concurrently, Green AI advocates for reducing the energy consumption and environmental impact of machine learning. To address these concerns, we introduce the first Green AI benchmarking framework for news recommendation, known as GreenRec, and propose a metric for assessing the tradeoff between recommendation accuracy and efficiency. Our benchmark encompasses 30 base models and their variants, covering traditional end-to-end training paradigms as well as our proposed efficient only-encode-once (OLEO) paradigm. Through experiments consuming 2000 GPU hours, we observe that the OLEO paradigm achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art end-to-end paradigms and delivers up to a 2992\\% improvement in sustainability",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，新闻推荐系统在学术界和工业界备受关注，强调了需要一个标准化基准来评估和比较这些系统的性能。同时，绿色人工智能倡导减少机器学习的能耗和环境影响。为了解决这些问题，我们引入了第一个用于新闻推荐的绿色AI基准测试框架，称为GreenRec，并提出了一个评估推荐准确性和效率之间权衡的度量标准。我们的基准测试涵盖30个基础模型及其变体，涵盖了传统的端到端训练范式以及我们提出的高效的仅编码一次（OLEO）范式。通过消耗2000个GPU小时的实验，我们观察到OLEO范式在可持续性方面相较于最先进的端到端范式实现了具竞争力的准确性，并提供高达2992%的可持续性改进。",
