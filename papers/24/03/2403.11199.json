    "translated_abstract": "消息传递机制是图神经网络在各种应用中取得成功的原因，但也带来了过度压缩的问题。最近的研究通过改善图谱的重连技术、破坏图中的结构偏见来抵制过度压缩，然而在过度压缩度量方面对过度压缩的改进有所限制。受到单元RNN的启发，我们提出了图单元消息传递（GUMP），通过应用单元邻接矩阵进行消息传递来缓解图神经网络中的过度压缩问题。为设计GUMP，首先提出了一种转换方法，使普通图具有单元邻接矩阵并保持其结构偏差。然后，通过利用单元邻接矩阵的固有结构实现单位化投影算法获得单元邻接矩阵，并允许GUMP是置换等变的。实验结果表明了GUMP在改善各种应用任务上性能的有效性。",
