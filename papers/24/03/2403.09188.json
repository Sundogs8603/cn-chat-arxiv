    "translated_abstract": "深度学习（DL）模型包含数百万甚至数十亿的参数，并从大数据中学习复杂模式。然而，并非所有数据最初都以适当的形式存储，以有效地训练DL模型，例如气相色谱-质谱（GC-MS）光谱和DNA序列。这些数据集通常包含许多零值，稀疏数据形式导致了优化DL模型的困难。提出了一种名为基础投影层（BPL）的DL模块，通过将稀疏数据转换为密集表示来缓解这个问题。预期转换后的数据将有助于DL训练过程中的梯度计算和微调过程。数据集中包含了从GC-MS检测到的362种特殊咖啡气味光谱作为稀疏数据集的示例。BPL层位于DL模型的开头。该层中的可调参数是可学习的投影轴，它们是一个新的基础。",
