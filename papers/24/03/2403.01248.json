This process requires complex spatial planning and arrangement. We tackle these challenges through a combination of advanced abstraction, strategic planning, and library learning. SceneCraft first models a scene graph as a blueprint, detailing the spatial relationships among assets in the scene. SceneCraft then writes Python scripts based on this graph, translating relationships into numerical constraints for asset layout. Next, SceneCraft leverages the perceptual strengths of vision-language foundation models like GPT-V to analyze rendered images and iteratively refine the scene. On top of this process, SceneCraft features a library learning mechanism that compiles common script functions into a reusable library, facilitating continuous self",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了SceneCraft，一个大型语言模型（LLM）代理，将文本描述转换为Blender可执行的Python脚本，用于渲染高达一百个三维资产的复杂场景。该过程需要复杂的空间规划和布局。我们通过高级抽象、战略规划和库学习的组合来解决这些挑战。SceneCraft首先将场景图建模为蓝图，详细描述场景中各资产之间的空间关系。然后，SceneCraft根据这个图编写Python脚本，将关系转化为资产布局的数值约束。接下来，SceneCraft利用像GPT-V这样的视觉-语言基础模型的感知优势来分析渲染图像并迭代地优化场景。在这个过程之上，SceneCraft具备一个库学习机制，将常见的脚本函数编译为可重复使用的库，促进持续的自我",
