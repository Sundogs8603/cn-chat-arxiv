    "translated_abstract": "玻璃构成了许多现代应用的基础，也在未来医疗和环境应用中具有巨大潜力。然而，它们的结构复杂性和庞大的组成空间使得对某些应用进行设计和优化具有挑战性。玻璃加工特别重要的是估计给定组成的玻璃成形能力（GFA）。然而，关于玻璃形成的物理机制仍存在许多未解之谜，特别是在氧化玻璃中。显而易见，用于估计GFA的代理属性将在玻璃加工和设计中非常有用，但寻找这样一个替代性属性已被证明是困难的。在这里，我们探讨了一个开源的预训练NN模型GlassNet的应用，该模型可以预测计算玻璃稳定性（GS）所需的特征温度，并评估使用这些物理启发式ML（PIML）预测的GS参数来估计形成能力的可行性。",
