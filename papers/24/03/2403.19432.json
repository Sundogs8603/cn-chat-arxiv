    "translated_abstract": "数据准确性对科学研究和政策制定至关重要。国家暴力死亡报告系统（NVDRS）数据被广泛用于发现死亡的模式和原因。最近的研究表明NVDRS内存在注释不一致性，并可能影响错误的自杀原因归因。我们提出了一种经验性的自然语言处理（NLP）方法来检测注释不一致性，并采用类似交叉验证的范式来识别有问题的实例。我们分析了2003年至2020年间从NVDRS中的267,804起自杀死亡案例。结果显示，将目标州的数据纳入训练自杀危机分类器，使得在目标州测试集上的F-1分数增加了5.4％，在其他州测试集上降低了1.1％。总之，我们展示了NVDRS死因调查笔记中的注释不一致性，并确定了问题的实例。",
