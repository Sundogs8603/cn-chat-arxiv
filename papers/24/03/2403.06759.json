    "translated_abstract": "医学图像分割的深度神经网络经常产生与经验观察不一致的过于自信的结果，这种校准错误挑战着它们的临床应用。我们提出使用平均L1校准误差（mL1-ACE）作为一种新颖的辅助损失函数，以改善像素级校准而不会损害分割质量。我们展示了，尽管使用硬分箱，这种损失是直接可微的，避免了需要近似但可微的替代或软分箱方法的必要性。我们的工作还引入了数据集可靠性直方图的概念，这一概念推广了标准的可靠性图，用于在数据集级别聚合的语义分割中细化校准的视觉评估。使用mL1-ACE，我们将平均和最大校准误差分别降低了45%和55%，同时在BraTS 2021数据集上保持了87%的Dice分数。我们在这里分享我们的代码: https://github",
