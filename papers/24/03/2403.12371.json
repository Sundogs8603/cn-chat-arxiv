    "translated_abstract": "针对时间序列分类的进展，通过审查先前的研究，大多数现有方法采用了一种常见的学习分类范式 - 时间序列分类模型试图学习序列输入和目标标签之间的关系，这些目标标签由一热分布编码。尽管有效，但这种范式隐藏了两个固有限制：(1) 使用一热分布对目标类别进行编码不能反映标签之间的可比性和相似性，(2) 非常难以在领域间学习可转移模型，这极大地阻碍了通用服务范式的发展。在这项工作中，我们提出了InstructTime，一个重塑时间序列分类为学习生成范式的新尝试。依靠预训练语言模型强大的生成能力，核心思想是将时间序列的分类作为一个多模态理解任务来制定，其中任务特定",
