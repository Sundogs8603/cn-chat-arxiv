    "translated_abstract": "我们对135名软件工程（SE）从业者进行了调查，以了解他们如何使用生成式AI聊天机器人（如ChatGPT）进行SE任务。我们发现他们希望将ChatGPT用于软件库选择等SE任务，但经常担心ChatGPT响应的真实性。我们开发了一套技术和一种名为CID（ChatGPT不正确性检测器）的工具，用于自动测试和检测ChatGPT响应中的不正确性。CID基于通过请求对ChatGPT进行迭代提示来提问具有情境相似但文本有分歧的问题（使用一种利用文本中的变态关系的方法）。CID的基本原则是，对于给定的问题，与其他响应不同（跨问题的多个化身）的响应可能是不正确的响应。 在一个关于库选择的基准研究中，我们展示CID能够检测ChatGPT的不正确响应。",
