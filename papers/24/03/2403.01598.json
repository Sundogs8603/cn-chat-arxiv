In this paper, we analyze the anime production workflow and rethink how to use characteristics of it for the sake of the real-world anime SR. First, we argue that video networks and datasets are not necessary for anime SR due to the repetition use of hand-drawing frames. Instead, we propose an anime image collection pipeline by choosing the least compressed and the most informative frames from the video sources. Based on this pipeline, we introduce the Anime Production-oriented Image (API) dataset. In addition, we identify two anime-specific challenges of distorted and faint hand-drawn lines and unwanted color artifacts. We address the first issue by introducing a prediction-oriented compression module in the image degradation model and a pseudo-ground truth preparatio",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管真实世界动漫超分辨率（SR）在SR社区中越来越受到关注，但现有方法仍然采用来自写实领域的技术。本文分析了动漫制作工作流程，并重新思考如何利用其中的特征来促进真实世界动漫SR。首先，我们认为视频网络和数据集对于动漫SR并不是必需的，因为手绘帧的重复使用。相反，我们提出了一个动漫图像收集流水线，通过从视频源中选择最少压缩和最具信息量的帧。基于该流水线，我们引入了动漫制作导向的图像（API）数据集。此外，我们确定了动漫特有的两个挑战：扭曲和淡薄的手绘线条以及不需要的色彩伪影。我们通过在图像退化模型中引入面向预测的压缩模块和伪基准数据准备来解决第一个问题。",
