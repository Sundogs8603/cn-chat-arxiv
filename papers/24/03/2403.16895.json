    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）在医学和自然科学研究等领域变得无处不在。然而，实际落地时，领域专家经常拒绝使用AI系统。低接受度阻碍了有效的人机合作，即使这对于进步至关重要。在自然科学研究中，科学家对启用AI系统的使用效果不佳会妨碍他们分析数据和推动研究。我们进行了一个以土著文化为基础的研究，对一个面临算法系统低采用率的组织的AI从业者和自然科学家进行了10次深度访谈。研究结果被整合成为更好的AI采用建议：i) 在系统使用的初始阶段积极支持专家，ii) 以用户相关的方式传达系统的能力，以及 iii) 遵循预定义的合作规则。我们讨论了我们研究结果的更广泛影响。",
