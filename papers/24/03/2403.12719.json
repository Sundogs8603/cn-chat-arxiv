This challenge is tackled through a semi-supervised multi-modal diagnosis framework. In particular, we introduce a new hypergraph framework that enables higher-order relations between multi-modal data, while utilising minimal labels. We first introduce a bilevel hypergraph optimisation framework that jointly learns a graph augmentation policy and a semi-supervised classifier. This dual learning strategy is hypothesised to enhance the robustness and generalisation capabilities of the model by fostering new pathways for information propagation.
