    "translated_abstract": "本文的主要目标是开发一个智能的农业决策支持系统，用于孟加拉国的作物选择和病害预测。该国家的经济在很大程度上依赖于农业。然而，选择生产率更高的作物以及有效控制作物病害是农民必须面对的障碍。本研究通过利用机器学习方法和实际数据集来解决这些问题。推荐的方法使用了多种数据集，涵盖作物生产、土壤条件、农业气象区域、作物病害和气象因素。这些数据集提供了关于病害趋势、作物对土壤营养需求以及农业生产历史的有见地信息。通过整合这些知识，该模型首先根据特定用户位置的土壤营养推荐主要选定作物的列表。然后，通过将来自不同数据源的信息进行整合，模型可以预测不同作物的产量和病害情况。",
