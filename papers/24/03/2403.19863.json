    "translated_abstract": "当神经网络在偏见数据集上训练时，它们往往会无意间学习到虚假的相关性，从而导致在实现强大的泛化性和鲁棒性方面面临挑战。目前解决这种偏见的方法通常包括利用偏见注释、根据伪偏见标签进行加权重、或通过增强技术增加偏见冲突数据点的多样性。我们引入了DeNetDM，这是一种基于观察结果的新型去偏见方法，浅层神经网络优先学习核心属性，而更深层次的神经网络在获取不同信息时强调偏见。我们利用从专家乘积中推导出的训练范式，创建了深浅架构的偏见和去偏见分支，然后用知识提炼产生目标的去偏见模型。大量实验证明，我们的方法优于当前的去偏见技术，实现了一个...",
