Assuming the stock can go bankrupt, i.e., lose all of its value, at some exogenous random time (independent of the stock price) modeled as the first arrival time of a homogeneous Poisson process, we study the Merton's optimal portfolio problem consisting of maximizing the expected logarithmic utility of the total wealth at a preselected finite maturity time. First, we present a heuristic derivation based on a new type of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.

    "translated_abstract": "考虑一个遵循几何布朗运动的股票市场和以恒定利率连续复利的无风险资产。假设股票可以破产，即在一些外生随机时间（独立于股价）内失去全部价值，这被建模为齐次泊松过程的第一到达时间，我们研究了梅顿的最优投资组合问题，旨在最大化在预先选择的有限到期时间内总财富的期望对数效用。首先，我们提出了一种基于新型哈密顿-雅可比-贝尔曼方程的启发式推导。然后，我们将问题形式化为经典的受控马尔可夫扩散，具有一种新类型的终端和运行成本。采用贝尔曼的动态规划原理严格推导出了梅顿比率的新版本，并用适当类型的验证定理进行验证。一个现实世界的例子将后者的比率与经典梅顿的r进行了比较。",

It considers the possibility of stock bankruptcy within a random time period and derives a new version of Merton's ratio using a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, formalizing the problem into a controlled Markovian diffusion process and validating it with a verification theorem."
