While previous methods have mitigated the issues on a small scale, it is essential to handle them simultaneously in larger-scale real-world scenarios. We propose a two-stage method, Editing Massive Concepts In Diffusion Models (EMCID). The first stage performs memory optimization for each individual concept with dual self-distillation from text alignment loss and diffusion noise prediction loss. The second stage conducts massive concept editing with multi-layer, closed form model editing. We further propose a comprehensive benchmark, named ImageNet Concept Editing Benchmark (ICEB), for evaluating massive concept editing for T2I models with two subtasks, free-form prompts, massive concept categories, and extensive evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments conducted on our proposed benchmark and previous benchmarks demo",

    "translated_abstract": "文本到图像扩散模型存在生成过时的、受版权保护的、不正确的和有偏见的内容的风险。虽然先前的方法已在小规模上缓解了这些问题，但在更大规模的实际场景中同时处理它们是至关重要的。我们提出了一个两阶段方法，即编辑海量概念扩散模型（EMCID）。第一阶段通过文本对齐损失和扩散噪声预测损失实现对每个单独概念的内存优化的双自蒸馏。第二阶段进行海量概念编辑，采用多层、封闭形式的模型编辑。我们进一步提出了一个名为ImageNet概念编辑基准（ICEB）的综合基准，用于评估针对T2I模型的海量概念编辑，包括两个子任务：自由形式提示和海量概念类别，以及广泛的评估指标。在我们提出的基准和先前的基准上进行了大量实验展示",
