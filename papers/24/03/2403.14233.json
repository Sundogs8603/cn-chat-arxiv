    "translated_abstract": "虽然主流的无监督异常检测算法在学术数据集中表现良好，但由于理想的干净训练数据的实验设置，它们在实际应用中的性能受到限制。 在真实世界的异常检测中，使用噪声数据进行训练是一个不可避免的问题，但很少有讨论。 本文首次考虑了图像传感器异常检测中的标签级别噪声。 为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于内存的无监督AD方法SoftPatch，该方法能够有效地对补丁级别的数据进行去噪。 噪声判别器用于生成用于补丁级别噪声消除的异常点评分，然后将这些评分存储在内存存储器中，以软化异常检测边界。 与现有方法相比，SoftPatch保持了对正常数据的强建模能力，并减轻了coreset中的过度自信问题。在实验中进行了综合性实验证明。",
