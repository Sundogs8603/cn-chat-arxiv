The probabilistic nature of the predictions can be exploited by using (proper) scoring rules in the model fitting process instead of likelihood-based optimization. Our proposal does so in a generic manner and can be used for a variety of model classes. We establish different parametric and non-parametric sub-frameworks that allow different degrees of flexibility.

    "translated_abstract": "生存分析为各个领域中部分不完整的事件发生时间数据提供了关键见解。它也是概率机器学习的一个重要示例。我们的提案以一种通用的方式利用了预测的概率性质，通过在模型拟合过程中使用（合适的）评分规则而非基于似然性的优化。我们建立了不同的参数化和非参数化子框架，允许不同程度的灵活性。将其混入神经网络中，导致了一个计算有效且可扩展的优化例程，产生了最先进的预测性能。最后，我们展示了使用我们的框架，可以恢复各种参数化模型，并证明在与基于似然性方法的比较中，优化效果同样出色。",
