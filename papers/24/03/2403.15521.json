    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了两种零训练方法，旨在增强脑机接口（BCI）的可用性，消除了校准会话的需求。我们介绍了一种根植于事件相关电位（ERP）领域的新颖方法，即无监督均值最大化（UMM），用于快速编码调制视觉诱发电位（c-VEP）刺激协议。我们将UMM与使用典型相关分析（CCA）的c-VEP零训练方法进行比较。比较包括对CCA和UMM的即时分类以及对先前分类试验进行累积学习的分类。我们的研究显示了两种方法在处理c-VEP数据集的复杂性方面的有效性，突出了它们之间的差异和独特优势。这项研究不仅为无校准BCI方法的实际实施提供了见解，还为进一步的探索和改进铺平了道路。",
