    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统在学术界和工业界都是一个越来越重要的领域，因为它们对数十亿用户的日常在线体验有着广泛影响。一个常见的问题是冷启动问题，在实际推荐系统中，用户和物品可能没有足够的信息来产生高质量的推荐。本研究侧重于另一个问题：在训练时推荐未见过的新用户和物品（非词汇，或OOV）。这种情况被称为归纳设置，对于基于因子分解的模型特别有问题，因为这些模型仅依赖于在训练时看到的用户/物品来编码固定的参数向量。许多现有的解决方案在实践中往往很天真，比如将OOV用户/物品分配到随机桶中。在这项工作中，我们解决了这个问题，并提出了利用可用用户/物品特征来改进嵌入表中OOV处理的方法。",
