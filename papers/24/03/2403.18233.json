However, this approach suffers from weak labelling, since the ground-truth histopathology labels do not describe the properties of individual ROIs. Recently, multi-scale approaches have sought to mitigate this issue by combining the context awareness of transformers with a CNN feature extractor to detect cancer from multiple ROIs using multiple-instance learning (MIL). In this work, we present a detailed study of several image transformer architectures for both ROI-scale and multi-scale classification, and a comparison of the performance of CNNs and transformers for ultrasound-based prostate cancer classification. We also design a novel multi-objective learning strategy that combines both ROI and core predictions to furth",
