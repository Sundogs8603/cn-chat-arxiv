    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.18350v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The latest advancements in machine learning and deep learning have brought forth the concept of semantic similarity, which has proven immensely beneficial in multiple applications and has largely replaced keyword search. However, evaluating semantic similarity and conducting searches for a specific query across various documents continue to be a complicated task. This complexity is due to the multifaceted nature of the task, the lack of standard benchmarks, whereas these challenges are further amplified for Arabic language. This paper endeavors to establish a straightforward yet potent benchmark for semantic search in Arabic. Moreover, to precisely evaluate the effectiveness of these metrics and the dataset, we conduct our assessment of semantic search within the framework of retrieval augmented generation (RAG).",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习和深度学习的最新进展带来了语义相似性的概念，已在多个应用中证明具有巨大益处，大大取代了关键词搜索。然而，评估语义相似性并在各种文档中为特定查询进行搜索仍然是一项复杂的任务。这种复杂性源于任务的多方面性，缺乏标准基准，而这些挑战对于阿拉伯语言而言更加复杂。本文致力于为阿拉伯语义搜索建立一个简单而强大的基准。此外，为了精确评估这些指标和数据集的有效性，我们在检索增强生成（RAG）框架内进行语义搜索的评估。",
