    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了贝叶斯扩散模型（BDM），这是一种预测算法，通过联合扩散过程将自上而下（先验）信息与自下而上（数据驱动）过程紧密耦合，实现有效的贝叶斯推断。我们展示了BDM在3D形状重建任务中的有效性。与基于配对（监督）数据标签（例如图像-点云）数据集训练的典型深度学习数据驱动方法相比，我们的BDM通过引入来自独立标签（例如点云）的丰富先验信息来改进自下而上的3D重建。与标准的贝叶斯框架相反，其需要明确的先验和似然进行推断，BDM通过学习的梯度计算网络通过耦合扩散过程执行无缝信息融合。我们BDM的特殊之处在于其能够在自上而下和自下而上的主动有效信息交换和融合。",
