    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.05668v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the evolving landscape of recommender systems, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT marks a new era, introducing the concept of Recommendation via LLM (RecLLM). While these advancements promise unprecedented personalization and efficiency, they also bring to the fore critical concerns regarding fairness, particularly in how recommendations might inadvertently perpetuate or amplify biases associated with sensitive user attributes. In order to address these concerns, our study introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework, CFaiRLLM, aimed at evaluating (and thereby mitigating) biases on the consumer side within RecLLMs.   Our research methodically assesses the fairness of RecLLMs by examining how recommendations might vary with the inclusion of sensitive attributes such as gender, age, and their intersections, through both similarity alignment and true preference alignment.

    "translated_abstract": "在推荐系统不断发展的过程中，像ChatGPT这样的大型语言模型的整合标志着引入了基于语言模型的推荐（RecLLM）的新时代。虽然这些进展承诺提供前所未有的个性化和效率，但也引发了对公平性的重要关切，特别是在推荐可能无意中继续或放大与敏感用户属性相关的偏见的情况下。为了解决这些问题，我们的研究引入了一个全面的评估框架CFaiRLLM，旨在评估（从而减轻）RecLLMs中消费者端的偏见。",
