As humans, we rely heavily on tactile information to understand objects in our environments and how to interact with them. We use touch not only to perform manipulation tasks but also to learn how to perform these tasks. Therefore, to create robotic agents that can learn to complete manipulation tasks at a human or super-human level of performance, we need to properly incorporate tactile information into both skill execution and skill learning. In this paper, we investigate how we can incorporate tactile information into imitation learning platforms to improve performance on complex tasks. To do this, we tackle the challenge of plugging in a USB cable, a dexterous manipulation task that relies on fine-grain visuo-tactile serving. By incorporating tactile information into imitation learning frameworks, we are able to train a robotic agent to plug in a USB cable - a firs",

    "translated_abstract": "触觉信息是进行精细操纵的关键工具。作为人类，我们在很大程度上依赖触觉信息来理解周围的物体以及如何与其互动。我们不仅使用触摸来执行操纵任务，还用它来学习如何执行这些任务。因此，为了创建能够学习以人类或超人类水平完成操纵任务的机器人代理，我们需要正确地将触觉信息融入技能执行和技能学习中。本文研究了如何将触觉信息纳入模仿学习平台以提高复杂任务的性能。为此，我们着手解决插拔USB电缆的挑战，这是一项依赖于微观视觉-触觉协作的熟练操纵任务。通过将触觉信息纳入模仿学习框架，我们能够训练一个机器人代理插拔USB电缆。",
