    "translated_abstract": "用户嵌入在用户参与度预测和个性化服务中起着至关重要的作用。序列建模的最新进展引发了从行为数据中学习用户嵌入的兴趣。然而，基于行为的用户嵌入学习面临动态用户建模的独特挑战。随着用户不断与应用程序交互，用户嵌入应定期更新以考虑用户的最近和长期行为模式。现有方法高度依赖于缺乏历史行为记忆的无状态序列模型。它们必须要么丢弃历史数据仅使用最新数据，要么重新处理旧数据和新数据。两种情况均会产生大量计算开销。为解决这一限制，我们引入了用户有状态嵌入（USE）。USE生成用户嵌入并反映用户不断发展的行为，而无需通过存储先前的模型状态来进行详尽的重新处理。",
