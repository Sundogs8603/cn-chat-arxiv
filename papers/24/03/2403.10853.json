    "translated_abstract": "在现实世界的场景中，由于成本过高，对于连续学习进行大量手动注释是不切实际的。虽然之前的研究受到大规模网络监督训练的影响，建议在连续学习中利用网络抓取的数据，但这带来了诸如数据不平衡、使用限制和隐私问题等挑战。为了解决连续网络监督训练的风险，我们提出了一种在线连续学习框架 - 仅使用名称的生成式连续学习（G-NoCL）。所提出的G-NoCL使用一组生成器G以及学习者。当遇到新概念（例如，类别）时，G-NoCL采用新颖的样本复杂性引导数据合成技术DIverSity and COmplexity enhancing ensemBlER（DISCOBER）从生成的数据中最优抽样训练数据。通过大量实验，我们展示了DISCOBER在G-NoCL在线连续学习基准测试中表现出的优越性能，涵盖了In-Distributi。",
