In this position paper, we argue that opponents in this debate hold different definitions for understanding, and particularly differ in their view on the role of consciousness. To substantiate this claim, we propose a thought experiment involving an open-source chatbot $Z$ which excels on every possible benchmark, seemingly without subjective experience. We ask whether $Z$ is capable of understanding, and show that different schools of thought within seminal AI research seem to answer this question differently, uncovering their terminological disagreement. Moving forward, we propose two distinct working definitions for understanding which explicitly acknowledge the question of consciousness, and draw connections with a rich literature in philosophy, psychology and neuroscience.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近LLMs的进展引发了一个关于它们是否理解文本的辩论。在这篇立场论文中，我们认为在这场辩论中，反对派对于理解有不同的定义，尤其在意识的作用上存在分歧。为了证实这一观点，我们提出一个思想实验，涉及一个在每个可能的基准上都表现出色的开源聊天机器人 $Z$，看似没有主观经验。我们问$Z$是否有理解能力，并展示在AI研究中的不同学派似乎以不同方式回答这个问题，揭示了它们在术语上的分歧。在未来，我们提出了两种明确定义的理解工作定义，明确承认了意识的问题，并与哲学、心理学和神经科学等丰富文献建立联系。",
