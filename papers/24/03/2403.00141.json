However, they are notorious for their lengthy, complex, and convoluted language especially involving privacy-related entities. Hence, they pose a significant challenge to users who attempt to comprehend organization's data usage policy. In this paper, we propose to enhance the interpretability and readability of policy documents by using controlled abstractive summarization -- we enforce the generated summaries to include critical privacy-related entities (e.g., data and medium) and organization's rationale (e.g.,target and reason) in collecting those entities. To achieve this, we develop PD-Sum, a policy-document summarization dataset with marked privacy-related entity labels. Our proposed model, EROS, identifies critical entities through a span-based entity extraction model and em",

    "translated_abstract": "隐私政策文件在向个人介绍组织对用户个人数据的收集、使用和保护方面发挥着关键作用。然而，它们以长篇、复杂和晦涩的语言而闻名，尤其涉及与隐私相关的实体。因此，对试图理解组织数据使用政策的用户构成了重大挑战。本文提出通过使用受控抽象摘要来增强政策文件的可解释性和可读性 -- 我们强制生成的摘要包括关键的隐私相关实体（如数据和媒体）以及组织的理由（如目标和原因）在收集这些实体时。为实现这一目标，我们开发了PD-Sum，一个带有标记的隐私相关实体标签的政策文件摘要数据集。我们提出的模型EROS通过基于跨度的实体提取模型识别关键实体。",
