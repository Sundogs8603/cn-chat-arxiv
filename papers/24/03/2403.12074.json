    "translated_abstract": "本研究的目标是对城市地区的基础设施质量不平等进行特征化。尽管越来越多的文献已经意识到特征化城市基础设施不平等的重要性，并提供了定量指标以指导城市发展规划，但大多数现有方法主要集中在测量基础设施的数量上，假定更多的基础设施更好。此外，现有研究主要集中在基于指数的方法上，其中城市地区基础设施供给状况是根据设定的主观权重确定的。对基础设施数量的关注和使用来自主观权重的指数已经妨碍了适当地研究基础设施不平等与城市不平等和环境正义考虑之间的关系。鉴此，我们提出一种基于机器学习的方法",
    "tldr": "通过机器学习的方法，超越了传统基于数量的基础设施不平等特征化研究，从而填补了城市不平等和环境正义考虑之间的研究空白。",
    "en_tdlr": "By using a machine learning-based approach, the study goes beyond conventional quantity-based analysis of infrastructure inequality, addressing the gap in understanding the relationship between urban inequality and environmental justice considerations."
