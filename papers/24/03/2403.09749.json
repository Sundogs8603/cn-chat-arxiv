    "translated_abstract": "在时间序列分类（TSC）中，提出了考虑顺序信息的时间池化方法。然而，我们发现每个时间池化具有不同的机制，并且根据时间序列数据的不同情况可能效果好坏不一。我们将这种固定池化机制称为单一视角的时间池化。在本文中，我们提出了一种具有多元视角学习的新型时间池化方法：选择多个时间池化（SoM-TP）。SoM-TP通过注意力动态选择多种方法中针对每个数据的最佳时间池化。SoM-TP的动态池化选择受到多选学习（MCL）集成概念的启发，该概念从多个输出中选择最佳输出。SoM-TP的注意力池化选择实现了单个分类器内的非迭代池化集成。此外，我们定义了一个视角损失和多元视角学习网络（DPLN）。",
