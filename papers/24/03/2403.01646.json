Harmful content is described as an inappropriate activity to harm or deceive an individual or a group of users. Alongside existing methods to detect misinformation and hate speech, users still need to be well-informed about the harmfulness of the content on SNSs. This study proposes a user-interactive system TweetInfo for mitigating the consumption of harmful content by providing metainformation about the posts. It focuses on two types of harmful content: hate speech and misinformation. TweetInfo provides insights into tweets by doing content analysis. Based on previous research, we have selected a list of metainformation. We offer the option to filter content based on metainformation Bot, Hate Speech, Misinformation, Verified Account, Sentiment, Tweet Category, Language. The proposed user interface all",
