This is particularly important for social robots designed for human care, which may face potentially dangerous situations for people, such as unseen obstacles in their way, that should be avoided. This paper explores the Artificial Theory of Mind (ATM) approach to inferring and interpreting human intentions. We propose an algorithm that detects risky situations for humans, selecting a robot action that removes the danger in real time. We use the simulation-based approach to ATM and adopt the 'like-me' policy to assign intentions and actions to people. Using this strategy, the robot can detect and act with a high rate of success under time-constrained situations.

    "translated_abstract": "要求机器人进行社交互动，它们必须准确解释人类意图并预测潜在结果。对于为人类护理设计的社交机器人而言尤为重要，可能会面临人类的危险情况，比如未见障碍物，应该予以避免。本文探讨了人工心智理论（ATM）方法来推断和解释人类意图。我们提出了一种检测人类风险情况的算法，选择实时消除危险的机器人动作。我们采用基于模拟的ATM方法，并采用“像我一样”的策略将意图和动作分配给人类。通过这种策略，机器人在有限时间内可以高成功率地检测和行动。该算法已经作为现有机器人认知架构的一部分实施，并在模拟场景中进行了测试。进行了三个实验。",
