    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.09892v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper develops an approach to language identification in which the set of languages considered by the model depends on the geographic origin of the text in question. Given that many digital corpora can be geo-referenced at the country level, this paper formulates 16 region-specific models, each of which contains the languages expected to appear in countries within that region. These regional models also each include 31 widely-spoken international languages in order to ensure coverage of these linguae francae regardless of location. An upstream evaluation using traditional language identification testing data shows an improvement in f-score ranging from 1.7 points (Southeast Asia) to as much as 10.4 points (North Africa). A downstream evaluation on social media data shows that this improved performance has a significant impact on the language labels which are applied to large real-world corpora. The result is a highly-accurate model ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种语言识别方法，其中模型考虑的语言集取决于文本的地理来源。鉴于许多数字文集可以在国家级别进行地理标注，本文制定了16个区域特定模型，每个模型包含在该区域内国家中出现的预期语言。这些区域模型还包括31种使用广泛的国际语言，以确保涵盖这些通用语无论位置如何。传统语言识别测试数据的上游评估显示，F分数的提高范围从1.7点（东南亚）到高达10.4点（北非）。对社交媒体数据进行的下游评估显示，这种改进的性能对应用于大型现实世界数据文集的语言标签有重要影响。结果是一个高度准确的模型。",
