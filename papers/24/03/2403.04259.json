    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了分散（离散）最优输运（D-OT）问题。在这种情况下，一组代理人共同设计运输方案，其中成本函数是每个代理人持有的成本之和。我们将D-OT问题重新表述为约束耦合优化问题，并提出了一种具有迭代复杂度为O(1/{\\epsilon})的单循环分散算法，与现有的集中式一阶方法相匹配。此外，我们提出了分散公平最优输运（DE-OT）问题。在DE-OT中，代理不仅协作设计最小化运输成本的运输计划，还努力确保各自成本的公平性。解决DE-OT的方法的迭代复杂度也是O(1/{\\epsilon})，这一速率提高了现有的集中式算法，其中获得的最佳迭代复杂度为O(1/{\\epsilon}^2)。",
