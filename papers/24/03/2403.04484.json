    "translated_abstract": "迁移学习已成为医学成像分类算法中不可或缺的一部分，通常利用ImageNet权重。然而，从自然到医学图像的领域转变促使了诸如RadImageNet 等替代方案的出现，往往展示出可比的分类性能。然而，目前尚不清楚迁移学习中性能提升是来自于改善的泛化还是快捷学习。为了解决这个问题，我们研究了两个公开的胸部X光片和CT数据集之间的潜在混杂因素--无论是合成的还是从数据中抽取的。我们发现ImageNet 和 RadImageNet 实现了可比的分类性能，然而 ImageNet 更容易过拟合混杂因素。我们建议使用ImageNet预训练模型的研究人员通过开展类似实验来重新审视模型的鲁棒性。我们的代码和实验可在https://github.com/DovileDo/source-mat 获取。",
