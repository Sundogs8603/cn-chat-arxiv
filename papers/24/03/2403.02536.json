    "translated_abstract": "预测太阳高能粒子(SEP)事件在太空任务逐渐扩展至地球保护磁层之外的情况下引起了越来越大的兴趣。这些事件大多是在太阳耀斑或快速日冕物质抛射驱动的冲击波期间产生的磁重连驱动过程的产物，对航空、太空电子设备以及尤其是太空探索构成了重要的辐射危害。在这项工作中，我们利用最近开发的数据集，结合了太阳动力学观测卫星/表面波和磁场成像仪(SDO/HMI)的空间天气HMI活跃区域补丁(SHARP)与太阳和日球联合观测卫星/米歇森多普勒成像仪(SoHO/MDI)的空间天气MDI活跃区域补丁(SMARPs)。我们采用一系列机器学习策略，包括支持向量机(SVM)和回归模型，评估这一新数据产品的预测潜力，用于预测太阳后期的空间天气活动。",
