    "translated_abstract": "在图结构数据的表示学习中，许多流行的图神经网络（GNNs）未能捕捉长程依赖关系，导致性能下降。此外，当关注的图表征为异质性（低同质性）时，这种弱点会被放大。为解决这一问题，本文提出了一种新颖的图学习框架，名为具有自注意力的图卷积网络（GCN-SA）。所提出的方案在节点级表示学习中表现出卓越的泛化能力。所提出的GCN-SA包含两个增强对应于边和节点特征。对于边，我们利用自注意力机制设计了一个稳定且有效的图结构学习模块，能够捕捉任意一对节点之间的内部相关性。这种图结构学习模块可以从整个图中为每个节点识别可靠的邻居。关于节点特征，我们修改...",
