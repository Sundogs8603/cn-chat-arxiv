To address this gap, we introduce a zero-shot prompt-based method using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for extracting hyper-relational knowledge from text. Comparing our model with a baseline, we achieved promising results, with a recall of 0.77. Although our precision is currently lower, a detailed analysis of the model outputs has uncovered potential pathways for future research in this area.",
