Many applications entail the unmixing of signals from mixtures of molecular species to identify the individual components present and their proportions, yet conventional methods for chemometrics often struggle with complex mixture scenarios encountered in practice. Here, we develop hyperspectral unmixing algorithms based on autoencoder neural networks, and we systematically validate them using both synthetic and experimental benchmark datasets created in-house. Our results demonstrate that unmixing autoencoders provide improved accuracy, robustness and efficiency compared to standard unmixing methods. We also showcase the applicability of autoencoders to complex biological settings by showing improved biochemical characterization of volumetric Raman imaging data from a monocytic cell.",

    "translated_abstract": "拉曼光谱广泛应用于科学领域，以非破坏性、无标记的方式表征样品的化学组成。许多应用需要从混合分子物种的信号中解混，以识别出现的个体组分及其比例，然而传统的化学计量学方法常常难以处理实践中遇到的复杂混合情况。在这里，我们基于自动编码器神经网络开发了基于高光谱解混的算法，并使用内部创建的合成和实验基准数据集对它们进行系统验证。我们的结果表明，与标准解混方法相比，解混自动编码器提供了更高的准确性、鲁棒性和效率。我们还展示了自动编码器在复杂生物环境中的适用性，通过展示从单核细胞的体积拉曼成像数据中改善的生物化学表征。",
