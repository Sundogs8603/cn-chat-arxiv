    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.02692v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recommender systems are vulnerable to injective attacks, which inject limited fake users into the platforms to manipulate the exposure of target items to all users. In this work, we identify that conventional injective attackers overlook the fact that each item has its unique potential audience, and meanwhile, the attack difficulty across different users varies. Blindly attacking all users will result in a waste of fake user budgets and inferior attack performance. To address these issues, we focus on an under-explored attack task called target user attacks, aiming at promoting target items to a particular user group. In addition, we formulate the varying attack difficulty as heterogeneous treatment effects through a causal lens and propose an Uplift-guided Budget Allocation (UBA) framework. UBA estimates the treatment effect on each target user and optimizes the allocation of fake user budgets to maximize the attack performance. Theoret",

    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统容易受到注入式攻击，即将有限数量的假用户注入平台以操纵目标物品对所有用户的曝光。本文发现传统的注入式攻击者忽视了每个物品都有其独特的潜在受众这一事实，同时，不同用户之间的攻击难度不同。盲目攻击所有用户将导致假用户预算的浪费和较差的攻击性能。为解决这些问题，我们关注一种被忽视的攻击任务，称为目标用户攻击，旨在将目标物品推广给特定用户群体。此外，我们通过因果镜头将不同的攻击难度形成为异质处理效应，并提出了一种提升引导的预算分配（UBA）框架。UBA评估每个目标用户的处理效应，并优化假用户预算的分配，以最大化攻击性能。",
