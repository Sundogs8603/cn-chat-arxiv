    "translated_abstract": "三维（3D）染色质相互作用，如增强子-启动子相互作用（EPIs），环状构象域（loops），拓扑相关域（TADs）和A/B区域通过调控基因表达在各种细胞过程中发挥关键作用。最近发展的染色质构象捕获技术使得即使使用单个细胞也能对各种3D结构进行全基因组分析。然而，由于技术、工具和数据分辨率低的差异，当前的3D结构目录仍然不完整且不可靠。机器学习方法作为一种替代方式出现，用于获取缺失的3D相互作用和/或改善分辨率。这些方法通常使用基因组注释数据（ChIP-seq，DNAse-seq等），DNA序列信息（k-mers，转录因子结合位点（TFBS）模体）和其他基因组特性来学习基因组特征与染色质相互作用之间的关联。",
