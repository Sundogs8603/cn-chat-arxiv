    "translated_abstract": "在研究任何因果机制，如大脑的因果网络时，因果充分性的假设起着关键作用。明显地，忽视这一假设可能导致重大错误，这一事实在大脑网络的因果分析中经常被忽视。在本研究中，我们提出了一种算法识别方法，用于确定满足因果充分性的关键外源节点，以在此类研究中遵循它的关键需求。我们的方法包括三个主要步骤：首先，通过捕捉Peter-Clark (PC)算法的本质，我们对网络内的区域对以及对来自其他网络节点条件的相同对进行独立性检验。接下来，我们通过分析条件和无条件结果之间的差异，利用Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验来区分候选混杂因素。随后，我们利用非因子化可识别变量。",
