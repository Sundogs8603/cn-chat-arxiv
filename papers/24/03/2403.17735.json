    "translated_abstract": "由于谣言在社交媒体上的迅速传播，谣言检测已经成为一个极其重要的挑战。现有的谣言检测方法取得了良好的性能，因为它们已经从相同数据分布中收集了足够的语料库进行模型训练。然而，由于新闻主题、社交媒体平台、语言之间的差异以及由新闻热度引起的传播规模的差异，训练数据和真实世界测试数据之间发生了显著的分布变化。这导致了这些现有方法在越界（OOD）情况下性能显著下降。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种名为测试时适应（TARD）的简单而高效的方法，用于在分布转移下进行谣言检测。该方法将新闻的传播建模为一个传播图，并构建传播图测试时适应框架，增强模型的适应性和鲁棒性。",
