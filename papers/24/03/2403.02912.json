    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了多面体设置中具有差分隐私（DP）的随机（凸凹）鞍点问题。我们提出了基于随机镜像下降的（ϵ，δ）-DP算法，其实现了预期对偶间隙的几乎与维度无关的收敛速率，这种保证在以前只针对双线性目标已知。对于凸凹和一阶平滑随机目标，我们的算法实现了一个率，即sqrt(log(d)/n) + (log(d)^{3/2}/[nϵ])^{1/3}，其中d是问题的维度，n是数据集大小。在额外的二阶平滑性假设下，我们将预期间隙的速率改进为sqrt(log(d)/n) + (log(d)^{3/2}/[nϵ])^{2/5}。在这种额外假设下，我们还通过使用偏差减少的梯度估计器，证明了对偶间隙受常数成功概率的界为log(d)/sqrt(n) + log(d)/[nϵ]^{1/2}。",
