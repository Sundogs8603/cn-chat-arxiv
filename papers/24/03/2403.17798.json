    "translated_abstract": "大多数卫生经济分析都是在计算机的帮助下进行的。然而，将卫生经济模型作为软件（或计算卫生经济模型（CHEMs））实施的研究伦理道德尚不明确。我们提议，CHEM的开发者和资助者应遵守研究伦理原则，并追求以下目标：（i）社会可接受的用户要求和设计规范；（ii）切合需求的实施；以及（iii）社会受益的发布后使用。我们进一步提议，透明（T）、可重用（R）和可更新（U）的CHEM表明项目团队在很大程度上已实现这些目标。我们提出六个评估TRU CHEMs的标准：（T1）软件文件是公开可用的；（T2）开发者对适当使用的贡献和判断容易识别；（R1）编程实践有利于独立重用模型组件；（R2）许可证允许重用和衍生作品；（U1）",
