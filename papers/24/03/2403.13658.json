    "translated_abstract": "最近在非侵入性检测心脏血液动力学不稳定性（CHDI）方面取得了进展，主要集中在将机器学习技术应用于单一数据形式，如心脏磁共振成像（MRI）。尽管这些方法具有潜力，但在标记的患者数据量有限时，这些方法通常效果不佳，这是医学领域的常见挑战。此外，只有少数研究探讨了多模态方法来研究CHDI，这些方法主要依赖昂贵的数据形式，如心脏MRI和心脏超声图。为了应对这些限制，我们提出了一种新颖的多模态变分自编码器（$\\text{CardioVAE}_\\text{X,G}$）来整合低成本胸部X射线（CXR）和心电图（ECG）数据形式，并在大型未标记数据集上进行预训练。具体来说，$\\text{CardioVAE}_\\text{X,G}$引入了一种新颖的三流预训练策略，以学习共享特征和各数据形式独有的特征，从而实现了fi",
