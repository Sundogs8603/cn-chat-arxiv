We propose a regularized estimator, establish its consistency, and derive its convergence rate. To conduct inference, we propose to debias the regularized estimate, and establish the asymptotic normality of the debiased estimator. Simulation studies support our theory.

    "translated_abstract": "受社交媒体病毒帖子的点赞分布（如点赞数量）经验性幂律的启发，我们引入了高维尾指数回归及其参数的估计和推断方法。我们提出了一种正则化估计量，证明了它的一致性，并推导了其收敛速度。为了进行推断，我们提出了去偏正则化估计，证明了去偏估计量的渐近正态性。仿真研究支持了我们的理论。这些方法被应用于对涉及 LGBTQ+ 话题的 X（原 Twitter）病毒帖子的文本分析。",
