The blockchain provides the mechanisms to transfer evidence, while smart contracts - programs executing within the blockchain in a decentralized and replicated fashion - allow encoding evidential protocols on top of a blockchain.

    "translated_abstract": "分布式不可变账本或区块链允许将佐证交易安全地数字化，无需依赖可信第三方。佐证交易涉及任何形式的物证交换，如货币、出生证明、签证、门票等。区块链提供了传输证据的机制，而智能合约——以分散和复制的方式在区块链内执行的程序——允许在区块链之上对佐证协议进行编码。由于智能合约放弃了可信第三方并在多台匿名机器上运行，因此它构成一个高度关键的程序，必须具有安全性和可信度设计。",
