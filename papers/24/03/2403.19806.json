    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文提出了一种使用回声状态网络（ESN）范式进行时间序列预测的新颖且可解释的循环神经网络结构。传统的ESN在动态系统预测方面表现良好，但需要一个具有增加计算复杂性的大动态储盆。它也缺乏解释性，难以区分不同输入组合对输出的贡献。在这里，通过使用由不同输入组合驱动的较小并行储水池开发了一个系统化的储水池架构，称为特征ESN（Feat-ESN），然后将它们进行非线性组合以产生输出。所得的基于特征的ESN在少量储水池节点的情况下胜过传统的单一储水池ESN。提出的架构的预测能力在三个系统上得到了展示：两个来自混沌动力系统的合成数据集和一组实时交通数据。",
