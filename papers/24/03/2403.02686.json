    "translated_abstract": "回声态性质（ESP）代表了储备计算（RC）框架中的一个基本概念，通过对初始状态和远期输入不加歧视来确保储蓄网络的仅输出训练。然而，传统的ESP定义并未描述可能演变统计属性的非平稳系统。为解决这一问题，我们引入了两类新的ESP：\\textit{非平稳ESP}，用于潜在非平稳系统，和\\textit{子空间/子集ESP}，适用于具有ESP的子系统的系统。根据这些定义，我们在量子储备计算（QRC）框架中数值演示了非平稳ESP与典型哈密顿动力学和使用非线性自回归移动平均（NARMA）任务的输入编码方法之间的对应关系。我们还通过计算线性/非线性记忆容量来确认这种对应关系，以量化",
