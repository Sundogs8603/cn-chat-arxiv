    "translated_abstract": "随着数据科学应用在各行各业中得到采用，工具景观不断成熟，以促进这类应用的生命周期并提供解决方案，以应对涉及的挑战，以提高参与者的生产力。在3D世界中使用代理进行强化学习仍然可能面临挑战：使用模拟软件所需的知识以及在无人监控的训练管道中利用独立的模拟软件。在本文中，我们回顾了用于在3D世界中培训机器人的强化学习代理的工具和方法，针对机器人Robotino进行论述，并认为为虚拟世界的创建者分离模拟环境与数据科学家的模型开发环境并不是一个被很好涵盖的主题。通常二者相同，数据科学家需要了解模拟软件，直接与其API一起使用。此外，有时虚拟世界的创建者会......",
