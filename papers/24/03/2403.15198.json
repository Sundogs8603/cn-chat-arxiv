    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一类在排名中允许对替代方案进行非对称处理并考虑有序列表中顶部和底部位置的不同相关性的距离函数族。我们对我们的距离进行全面的公理化特征描述。在这个过程中，我们检索了现有公理的新特征并展示了如何有效地为我们的目的削弱它们。这种分析突出了我们的距离的一般性，因为它嵌入了文献中之前提出的许多(半)度量。随后，我们展示了，尽管它的一般性水平，我们的距离仍然可以很容易地应用。我们将其应用于偏好聚合，研究相关中值选举规则的特征。我们展示了衍生偏好函数如何在选举规则的背景下满足许多理想特性，从公平性到多数和帕累托相关的特性。我们展示了如何确切计算共识排名。",
