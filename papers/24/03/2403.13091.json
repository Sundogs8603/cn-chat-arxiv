JaxUED leverages hardware acceleration to obtain on the order of 100x speedups compared to prior, CPU-based implementations. Inspired by CleanRL, we provide fast, clear, understandable, and easily modifiable implementations, with the aim of accelerating research into UED. This paper describes our library and contains baseline results. Code can be found at https://github.com/DramaCow/jaxued.",
