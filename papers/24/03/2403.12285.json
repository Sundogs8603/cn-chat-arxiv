    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.12285v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: There are multiple sources of financial news online which influence market movements and trader's decisions. This highlights the need for accurate sentiment analysis, in addition to having appropriate algorithmic trading techniques, to arrive at better informed trading decisions. Standard lexicon based sentiment approaches have demonstrated their power in aiding financial decisions. However, they are known to suffer from issues related to context sensitivity and word ordering. Large Language Models (LLMs) can also be used in this context, but they are not finance-specific and tend to require significant computational resources. To facilitate a finance specific LLM framework, we introduce a novel approach based on the Llama 2 7B foundational model, in order to benefit from its generative nature and comprehensive language manipulation. This is achieved by fine-tuning the Llama2 7B model on a small portion of supervised financial sentiment ",

    "translated_abstract": "金融新闻在线有多个来源影响市场走势和交易员的决策。这突出了准确情感分析的需求，除了需要适当的算法交易技术来做出更明智的交易决策。标准的基于词典的情感方法已经证明它们在辅助金融决策方面的能力。然而，众所周知它们存在与上下文敏感性和词序相关的问题。大型语言模型（LLMs）也可以在这个背景下使用，但它们不是特定于金融领域的，并且往往需要大量的计算资源。为了促进一种特定于金融领域的LLM框架，我们引入了一种基于Llama 2 7B基础模型的新方法，以便从其生成性质和全面的语言操作中受益。这是通过在少部分监督金融情感数据上微调Llama2 7B模型来实现的。",
