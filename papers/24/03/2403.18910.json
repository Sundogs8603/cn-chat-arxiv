    "translated_abstract": "基于似然的深度生成模型(DGMs)通常表现出令人困惑的行为：当在相对复杂的数据集上训练时，它们会给来自更简单来源的离群数据赋予更高的似然值。更使人感到神秘的是，尽管具有更高的似然值，但这些DGMs从未生成过离群样本。这个双管齐下的悖论尚未得到最终解释，使得基于似然的离群检测不可靠。我们的主要观察是，如果高似然区域中包含了最小概率质量，那么这些区域将不会被生成。我们演示了在围绕低维流形数据的地方可能出现大密度但低概率质量的看似矛盾情况。我们还展示了通过本地固有维度(LID)估计可以识别这种场景，并提出了一种通过预训练的DGM获得的似然和LID估计相配对的离群检测方法。",
