We propose a novel framework for building federated scoring systems for multi-site survival outcomes, ensuring both privacy and communication efficiency.

    "translated_abstract": "存活分析在许多医疗应用中扮演着基础组件的角色，对患者特定事件的时间（如某种疾病的发作或死亡）的确定对临床决策至关重要。评分系统被广泛用于快速和高效的风险预测。然而，现有的构建生存评分系统的方法假定数据源自单一来源，这在与多个数据所有者合作时存在隐私挑战。我们提出了一种新颖的框架，用于构建多站点生存结果的联邦评分系统，确保隐私和通信效率。我们将我们的方法应用于新加坡和美国急诊室各自来源的异构生存数据的站点。此外，我们在每个站点独立开发了本地评分。在每个参与者站点的测试数据集中，我们提出的联邦评分系统...",
