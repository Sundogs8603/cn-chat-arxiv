By employing reinforcement learning, we train an agent to acquire the necessary skills for proficient manipulation. To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the learning process, two knowledge transfer strategies, fine-tuning and curriculum learning, were utilized within the soft actor-critic architecture. Fine-tuning allows the agent to leverage pre-trained knowledge and adapt it to new tasks. Several variations like model transfer, policy transfer, and across-task transfer were implemented and evaluated. To eliminate the need for pretraining, curriculum learning decomposes the advanced task into simpler, progressive stages, mirroring how humans learn. The number of learning stages, the context of the sub-tasks, and the transition timing were found to be the critical design parameter",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了一个基于学习的三指机械臂操纵任务，该任务需要指间的复杂运动和协调。通过采用强化学习，我们训练一个智能体来获得熟练操纵所需的技能。为了增强学习过程的效率和有效性，我们在软演员-评论家架构中采用了两种知识转移策略，即微调和课程学习。微调使智能体可以利用预先训练的知识并将其调整到新任务中。实施和评估了多种变体，如模型转移、策略转移和跨任务转移。为了消除预训练的需求，课程学习将高级任务分解为更简单、渐进的阶段，模拟了人类学习过程。发现学习阶段的数量、子任务的背景以及转换时机是关键的设计参数。",
