    "translated_abstract": "我们的论文提出了一种新型的抵御黑盒攻击的方法，攻击者利用受害者模型作为 Oracle 来构建他们的对抗性样本。与传统的预处理防御方法不同，我们的无状态策略实际上对抗攻击过程本身。我们针对每个查询都评估一个反样本，其中反样本是针对攻击者的目标进行优化的原始样本。通过用有针对性的白盒优化来对抗每一个黑盒查询，我们的策略有效地为防御者引入了对称性，使其处于有利地位。这种防御不仅能够有效地误导攻击者寻找对抗性示例，还能保留在合法输入上的模型准确性，并且适用于多种类型的攻击。我们证明，我们的方法对最先进的黑盒攻击非常有效，并且在 C 上胜过现有的防御方法。",
