In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we provide the first end-to-end theory of learning one-layer transformers with softmax attention in MIM self-supervised pretraining. On the conceptual side, we posit a theoretical mechanism of how transformers, pretrained with MIM, produce empirically observed local and diverse attention patterns on data distributions with spatial structures that highlight feature-position correlations.
