Despite these challenges, such fine-grained control, by way of disentanglement is a crucial enabler for data-driven racial bias mitigation strategies across multiple automated facial analysis tasks, as it allows to analyse, characterise and synthesise human facial diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN framework to enable fine-grained control over individual race-related phenotype attributes of the facial images. Our framework factors the latent (feature) space into elements that correspond to race-related facial phenotype representations, thereby separating phenotype aspects (e.g. skin, hair colour, nose, eye, mouth shapes), which are notoriously difficult to annotate robustly in real-world facial data.",

    "translated_abstract": "通过实现对2D面部图像的有效的细粒度外观变化，同时保留面部身份，是一项具有挑战性的任务，因为常见的2D面部特征编码空间具有很高的复杂性和纠缠性。尽管存在这些挑战，通过分解来实现这种细粒度控制是数据驱动的种族偏见缓解策略的关键因素，因为它允许分析、表征和合成人类面孔的多样性。本文提出了一个新颖的GAN框架，以实现对面部图像个体种族相关表型属性的细粒度控制。我们的框架将潜在（特征）空间分解为相应于种族相关面部表型表示的元素，从而分离表型方面（例如皮肤、头发颜色、鼻子、眼睛、嘴巴形状），这在真实世界的面部数据中是极其难以鲁棒地标注的。",
