    "translated_abstract": "训练高质量的深度学习模型是一项具有挑战性的任务，这是因为需要计算和技术要求。越来越多的个人、机构和公司越来越多地依赖于在公共代码库中提供的预训练的第三方模型。这些模型通常直接使用或集成到产品管道中而没有特殊的预防措施，因为它们实际上只是以张量形式的数据，被认为是安全的。在本文中，我们提出了一种针对神经网络的新的机器学习供应链威胁。我们介绍了MaleficNet 2.0，一种在神经网络中嵌入自解压自执行恶意软件的新技术。MaleficNet 2.0使用扩频信道编码结合纠错技术在深度神经网络的参数中注入恶意有效载荷。MaleficNet 2.0注入技术具有隐蔽性，不会降低模型的性能，并且对...",
