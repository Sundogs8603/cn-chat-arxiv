This is especially evident in low-resource languages, such as Sinhala, which face two primary challenges: the lack of substantial training data and limited benchmarking datasets. In response, this study introduces NSINA, a comprehensive news corpus of over 500,000 articles from popular Sinhala news websites, along with three NLP tasks: news media identification, news category prediction, and news headline generation. The release of NSINA aims to provide a solution to challenges in adapting LLMs to Sinhala, offering valuable resources and benchmarks for improving NLP in the Sinhala language. NSINA is the largest news corpus for Sinhala, available up to date.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的引入推动了自然语言处理（NLP）的发展，但它们的有效性在很大程度上取决于预训练资源。尤其是在低资源语言（如僧伽罗语）中，这一点尤为明显，因为它们面临着两个主要挑战：缺乏充足的训练数据和有限的基准数据集。为应对这一问题，本研究介绍了NSINA，这是一个包括来自热门僧伽罗语新闻网站的50万多篇文章的全面新闻语料库，以及三项NLP任务：新闻媒体识别、新闻类别预测和新闻标题生成。NSINA的发布旨在为适应僧伽罗语的LLMs带来解决方案，提供有价值的资源和用于改进僧伽罗语NLP的基准。NSINA是迄今为止最大的僧伽罗语新闻语料库。",
    "tldr": "NSINA是为解决僧伽罗语中LLMs适应性挑战而引入的最大新闻语料库，为改进该语言的自然语言处理提供了宝贵资源和基准。"
