    "translated_abstract": "人类声音的解释在各种应用中都很重要。本研究探讨了从语音线索中预测年龄、性别和情绪，这是一个具有广泛应用的领域。声音分析技术的进展跨越各个领域，从改善客户互动到增强医疗保健和零售体验。辨识情绪有助于心理健康，而年龄和性别的检测在各种情境中至关重要。探索这些预测的深度学习模型涉及比较单一、多输出和顺序模型，这些模型在本文中得到了重点展示。寻找合适的数据提出了挑战，导致了CREMA-D和EMO-DB数据集的融合。以前的工作在个别预测方面表现出潜力，但有限的研究同时考虑了这三个变量。本文确定了个别模型方法中的缺陷，并倡导我们的新颖多输出学习架构Speech-based Emotion Gender。",
