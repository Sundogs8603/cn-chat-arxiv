Contractual clauses are obligatory, and the requirements derived from contracts can detail the downstream implementation activities that non-legal stakeholders, including requirement analysts, engineers, and delivery personnel, need to conduct. However, comprehending contracts is cognitively demanding and error-prone for such stakeholders due to the extensive use of Legalese and the inherent complexity of contract language. Furthermore, contracts often contain ambiguously worded clauses to ensure comprehensive coverage. In contrast, non-legal stakeholders require a detailed and unambiguous comprehension of contractual clauses to craft actionable requirements. In this work, we introduce a novel legal NLP task that involves generating clarification questions for contracts. These questions aim to identify contract ambigui",

    "translated_abstract": "企业经常签订商业合同，这些合同可以作为项目特定需求的重要来源。合同条款是必须遵守的，并且从合同中得出的需求可以详细说明非法务利益相关者（包括需求分析师、工程师和交付人员）需要进行的下游实施活动。然而，由于广泛使用法律术语和合同语言的固有复杂性，理解合同对这些利益相关者来说是一项认知上的挑战，也容易出错。此外，为了确保全面覆盖，合同通常包含措辞含糊的条款。相反，非法务利益相关者需要详细明了、无歧义地理解合同条款，以制定可执行的需求。在这项工作中，我们介绍了一个涉及生成合同澄清问题的新颖法律自然语言处理任务。这些问题旨在识别合同的歧义。",
