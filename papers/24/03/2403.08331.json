    "translated_abstract": "许多领域，包括设计和控制，都需要优化产品和系统特性。 当观测成本高时，通常使用Bayesian优化（BO），因为BO从理论上保证了遗憾的上限。 然而，随着要优化参数数量的增加，计算成本呈指数级增加，导致搜索效率降低。 我们提出了一种将搜索区域限制在较低维度并利用本地高斯过程回归（LGPR）将BO扩展到更高维度的方法。 LGPR将低维搜索区域视为“本地”，从而提高了那里的预测准确性。 LGPR模型是在特定区域的本地数据子集上训练的。 这提高了预测精度和搜索效率，并减少了高斯过程回归中矩阵求逆的时间复杂度。 在评估20D Ackley和Rosenbrock函数时，搜索效率与或高于既定值。",
