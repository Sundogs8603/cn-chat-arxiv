    "translated_abstract": "我们重新审视了带有个体公平性的在线学习问题，其中在线学习者努力在最大化预测准确性的同时确保相似个体受到类似对待。我们首先扩展了Gillen等人（2018年）；Bechavod等人（2020年）的框架，这些框架依赖于来自人类审计员有关公平性违规的反馈，因为我们考虑了能够聚合任意数量审计员反馈的审计方案，使用了我们称为单调聚合函数的丰富类别。然后，我们证明了这种审计方案的特性，通过实际将多个审计员的个体公平性审计分析简化为（实例特定的）单个审计员的审计。利用我们的广义框架，我们提出了一个实现上界前沿的oracle-efficient算法，分别为遗憾值和公平性违规次数的上界$(\\mathcal{O}(T^{1/2+2b}),\\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4-b}))$，其中$0\\leq b$",
