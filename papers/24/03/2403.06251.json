Our method is trained online to update our enhanced discriminative correlation filter to conglutinate the tracing process. This distinctive offline-training-free schema differentiates us from other training-dependent tracing approaches like deep learning methods since no annotation is needed for our method. Besides, compared to other tracing methods requiring complicated set-up such as for clustering and graph multi-cut, our approach is much easier to be applied to new images. In fact, it only needs a starting bounding box of the tracing neuron, significantly reducing users' configuration effort. Our extensive experiments show that our training-free and easy-configured methodology allows fast and accurate neuron reconstructions in multi-spectral images.",

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们提出了一种在线多光谱神经追踪方法，其具有独特设计的模块，无需离线训练。我们的方法通过在线训练来更新增强的判别性相关滤波器，以连接追踪过程。这种独特的无离线训练模式使我们与其他需要训练依赖的追踪方法（如深度学习方法）不同，因为我们的方法不需要注释。此外，与其他追踪方法相比，其他方法需要复杂的设置，例如用于聚类和图多切割，我们的方法更容易应用于新图像。事实上，它只需要一个追踪神经元的起始边界框，显著减少了用户的配置工作。我们广泛的实验证明，我们的无需训练和易配置的方法允许在多光谱图像中进行快速准确的神经重构。",
