There may be instances of discordance regarding the perception of fairness, even when the outcomes comply with established fairness metrics. Several surveys have been conducted to evaluate fairness metrics with human perceptions of fairness. However, these surveys were limited in scope, including only a few hundred participants within a single country. In this study, we conduct an international survey to evaluate the appropriateness of various fairness metrics in decision-making scenarios. We collected responses from 1,000 participants in each of China, France, Japan, and the United States, amassing a total of 4,000 responses, to analyze the preferences of fairness metrics. Our survey consists of three distinct scenarios paired with four fairness metrics, and each participant answers their preference for the fairness metric in each case.
