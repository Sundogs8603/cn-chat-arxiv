To address this challenge, we propose a chain-of-thought (CoT) prompted adaptive enhancer, CPA-Enhancer, for object detection under unknown degradations. Specifically, CPA-Enhancer progressively adapts its enhancement strategy under the step-by-step guidance of CoT prompts, that encode degradation-related information.

    "translated_abstract": "目前，已经广泛研究了在已知单一退化情况下的目标检测方法。然而，现有方法需要先验知识来确定退化类型，并为每种类型训练一个单独的模型，从而限制了它们在不可预测环境中的实际应用。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了一种链式思维（CoT）驱动的自适应增强器CPA-Enhancer，用于未知退化情况下的目标检测。具体而言，CPA-Enhancer在CoT提示的逐步指导下逐步调整其增强策略，这些提示编码了与退化相关的信息。据我们所知，这是首个利用CoT提示进行目标检测任务的工作。总的来说，CPA-Enhancer是一个即插即用的增强模型，可以集成到任何通用检测器中，在不事先知道退化类型的情况下，在受损图像上实现显著提升。实验结果表明，CPA-E",
