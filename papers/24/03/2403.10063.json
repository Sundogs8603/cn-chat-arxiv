    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了统一的无投影Frank-Wolfe类型算法，用于对抗性连续DR-次模优化，涵盖了诸如全信息和（半）强敌反馈、单调和非单调函数、不同约束以及类型的随机查询等场景。在非单调设置中考虑的每个问题中，所提出的算法要么是第一个具有证明的次线性 $\\alpha$-后悔上界的算法，要么具有比现有技术更好的 $\\alpha$-后悔上界，其中 $\\alpha$ 是离线设置中的相应近似上界。在单调设置中，所提出的方法在8个考虑的情况中的7种中是无投影算法的最新次线性 $\\alpha$-后悔上界，同时与剩余情况的结果相匹配。此外，本文还研究了对抗性DR-次模优化的半强敌和强敌反馈，推进了对这一问题的理解。",
