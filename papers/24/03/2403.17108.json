    "translated_abstract": "这项工作旨在开发一种有效的元启发式方法，以防范对使用图模型的网络中的节点的多个同时攻击。具体来说，我们关注$k$-强罗马占领问题，这是对图上著名罗马占领问题的一般化。该问题是关于为节点分配整数权重，这些权重代表着每个节点驻扎的部队数量，以满足保护约束条件的同时最小化总权重。这些约束涉及对图对抗任何由$k \\in \\mathbb{N}$个节点组成的同时攻击的保护。如果可以通过从一个相邻节点借用军队来保护标记为0的每个节点，并确保该邻居至少保留一支军队进行自卫，则攻击被视为被击退。$k$-SRD问题在各个领域具有实际应用，例如制定反恐策略或管理...",
