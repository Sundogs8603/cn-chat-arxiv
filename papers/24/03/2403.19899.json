Advanced tools facilitate emotion analysis, capturing user sentiments during interactions, while structured feedback sessions offer qualitative insights. Results indicate that while the text-based system minimizes user confusion, the image-based system presents challenges in direct information interpretation.

    "translated_abstract": "数字领域见证了各种搜索模式的崛起，其中基于图像的对话式搜索系统脱颖而出。这项研究深入探讨了该特定系统的设计、实施和评估，并将其与基于文本和混合的对照系统进行了对比。多样化的参与者队伍确保了广泛的评估范围。先进工具促进情绪分析，捕捉用户在互动过程中的情绪，而结构化反馈会话提供了定性洞见。结果表明，虽然基于文本的系统最大程度地减少了用户的困惑，但基于图像的系统存在直接信息解释方面的挑战。然而，混合系统实现了最高的参与度，表明视觉和文本信息的最佳融合。值得注意的是，这些系统的潜力，特别是基于图像的模式，以协助智力障碍者的个体特征。",
