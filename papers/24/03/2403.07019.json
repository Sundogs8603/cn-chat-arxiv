Water shortage can harm public health by increasing the chance of contracting water-borne diseases, dehydration, and malnutrition. This study aims to examine the causes of the water problem and its likely effects on human health. The study scrutinizes the reasons behind the water crisis, including population increase, climate change, and inefficient water management techniques. The results of a lack of water on human health, such as the spread of infectious diseases, a higher risk of starvation and dehydration, and psychological stress, are also concealed in the study.
