    "translated_abstract": "一幅素描的绘制顺序记录了它是如何逐笔由人类创建的。对于图形素描表示学习，最近的研究通过根据基于时间的最近邻策略将每个补丁与另一个相连，将素描绘图顺序注入到图边构建中。然而，这样构建的图边可能不可靠，因为素描可能有不同版本的绘图。在本文中，我们提出了一种经过变体绘制保护的方法，通过为素描补丁配备具有上下文感知的位置编码(PE)，以更好地利用绘图顺序来学习图形素描表示。我们没有将素描绘制注入到图边中，而是仅将这些顺序信息嵌入到图节点中。具体来说，每个补丁嵌入都配备有正弦绝对PE，以突出绘图顺序中的顺序位置。它的相邻补丁按self-att的价值排序",
