However, one limitation of these methods is their inability to incorporate public data. Initializing a data generating model by pre-training on public data has shown to improve the quality of synthetic data, but this technique is not applicable when model structure is not determined a priori. We develop the mechanism jam-pgm, which expands the adaptive measurements framework to jointly select between measuring public data and private data. This technique allows for public data to be included in a graphical-model-based mechanism. We show that jam-pgm is able to outperform both publicly assisted and non publicly assisted synthetic data generation mechanisms even when the public data distribution is biased.",

    "translated_abstract": "基于边际和图模型的不同ially私密合成数据生成机制已在各种设置中取得成功。然而，这些方法的一个局限性是它们无法整合公共数据。通过在公共数据上进行预训练来初始化数据生成模型已被证明可以提高合成数据的质量，但当模型结构未事先确定时，该技术无法应用。我们开发了机制jam-pgm，将自适应测量框架扩展到联合选择测量公共数据和私密数据之间。这一技术允许将公共数据纳入基于图模型的机制中。我们展示了，即使在公共数据分布存在偏差的情况下，jam-pgm能够胜过公共辅助和非公共辅助的合成数据生成机制。",
