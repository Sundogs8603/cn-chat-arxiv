To capture the correlations between tweets and locations, a Tweet-Location Matching objective is further adopted into the framework and refined via an online hard negative mining approach.

    "translated_abstract": "社交地理定位是一个重要问题，即预测社交媒体帖子的来源地点。然而，由于需要大量训练数据，以及完善的标注标签，这个任务很具挑战性。这些问题进一步恶化，因为新的或不太热门的地点缺乏足够的标签，导致数据集不平衡。在本文中，我们提出了ContrastGeo，这是一个利用对比学习增强的框架，用于少样本社交地理定位。具体地，引入了一个Tweet-Location对比学习目标，以在帖子-位置对之间对齐表示。为了捕捉帖子和位置之间的关联，进一步采用了Tweet-Location匹配目标，并通过在线困难负样本挖掘方法进行了改进。我们还开发了三种融合策略，采用不同的融合编码器，以更好地生成联合表示。",
