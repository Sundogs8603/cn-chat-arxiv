The existing deep learning systems for health acoustics are often narrowly trained and evaluated on a single task, which is limited by data and may hinder generalization to other tasks. To mitigate these gaps, we develop HeAR, a scalable self-supervised learning-based deep learning system using masked autoencoders trained on a large dataset of 313 million two-second long audio clips. Through linear probes, we establish HeAR as a state-of-the-art health audio embedding model on a benchmark of 33 health acoustic tasks across 6 datasets. By introducing this work, we hope to enable and accelerate further health acoustics research.",

    "translated_abstract": "健康声学声音，如咳嗽和呼吸声，已知包含有用的健康信号，具有监测健康和疾病的重要潜力，但在医疗机器学习社区中尚未得到充分探讨。现有的健康声学深度学习系统通常只针对单一任务进行狭窄训练和评估，这受到数据限制，可能限制了对其他任务的泛化能力。为了弥合这些差距，我们开发了HeAR，这是一个可伸缩的基于自监督学习的深度学习系统，使用了一个包含3.13亿个两秒长音频剪辑的大型数据集来训练掩码自编码器。通过线性探测，我们将HeAR确立为在六个数据集上的33个健康声学任务基准上的最先进的健康音频嵌入模型。通过引入这项工作，我们希望能够启用和加速进一步的健康声学研究。",
