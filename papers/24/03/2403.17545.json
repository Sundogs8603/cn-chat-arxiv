    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.17545v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Situated conversations, which refer to visual information as visual question answering (VQA), often contain ambiguities caused by reliance on directive information. This problem is exacerbated because some languages, such as Japanese, often omit subjective or objective terms. Such ambiguities in questions are often clarified by the contexts in conversational situations, such as joint attention with a user or user gaze information. In this study, we propose the Gaze-grounded VQA dataset (GazeVQA) that clarifies ambiguous questions using gaze information by focusing on a clarification process complemented by gaze information. We also propose a method that utilizes gaze target estimation results to improve the accuracy of GazeVQA tasks. Our experimental results showed that the proposed method improved the performance in some cases of a VQA system on GazeVQA and identified some typical problems of GazeVQA tasks that need to be improved.",

    "translated_abstract": "位于对话，指的是将视觉信息称为视觉问答(VQA)的情境谈话，常常含有由于依赖指示性信息而产生的模糊性。这个问题加剧了，因为一些语言，比如日语，常常省略主观或客观术语。这种问题中的模糊性通常通过对话情景中的语境来澄清，比如与用户的联合关注或用户注视信息。在这项研究中，我们提出了通过注视信息澄清模糊问题的GazeVQA数据集(Gaze-grounded VQA dataset) ，重点关注由注视信息辅助的澄清过程。我们还提出了一种利用注视目标估计结果来提高GazeVQA任务准确性的方法。我们的实验结果显示，所提出的方法改善了VQA系统在GazeVQA上的性能，同时确定了一些GazeVQA任务中需要改进的典型问题。",
