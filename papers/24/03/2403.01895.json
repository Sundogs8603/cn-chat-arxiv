However, the commonly used Euclidean distance is sensitive to noise. While existing works have explored dynamic time warping (DTW) for its robustness, they only support supervised tasks over multivariate time series (MTS), leaving a scarcity of unsupervised methods. In this work, we propose FCM-wDTW, an unsupervised distance metric learning method for anomaly detection over MTS, which encodes raw data into latent space and reveals normal dimension relationships through cluster centers. FCM-wDTW introduces locally weighted DTW into fuzzy C-means clustering and learns the optimal latent space efficiently, enabling anomaly identification via data reconstruction. Experiments with 11 different types of benchmarks demonstrate our method's competitive accuracy and efficiency.",

    "translated_abstract": "基于距离的时间序列异常检测方法由于其相对非参数化的特性和可解释性而广泛存在。然而，常用的欧几里得距离对噪声敏感。虽然现有工作已经探讨了动态时间规整（DTW）以增强其稳健性，但它们仅支持多变量时间序列（MTS）上的监督任务，缺乏无监督方法。在这项工作中，我们提出了FCM-wDTW，一种用于多变量时间序列异常检测的无监督距离度量学习方法，它将原始数据编码成潜在空间，并通过聚类中心揭示正常维度关系。FCM-wDTW将局部加权DTW引入到模糊C均值聚类中，并有效地学习最佳的潜在空间，从而通过数据重建实现异常识别。针对11种不同类型的基准进行的实验表明，我们的方法具有竞争力的准确性和效率。",
