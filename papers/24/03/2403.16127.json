Our model is based on SEA-LION and a collection of instruction following datasets. To promote open research and reproducibility, we publically release all training data, code, and the final model weights under the Apache-2 license. To assess the contextual understanding capability, we conducted extensive experimental studies using two Thai MRC datasets, XQuAD and Iapp_wiki_qa_squad. Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to comprehend the context and produce an answer faithful to the reference one in 0-shot and 1-shot settings. In addition, our evaluation goes beyond the traditional MRC. We propose a new evaluation scheme assessing the answer's correctness, helpfulness, conciseness, and contextuality.

    "translated_abstract": "本技术报告描述了WangchanLion的开发过程，这是一个专注于泰语机器阅读理解（MRC）的指令微调模型。我们的模型基于SEA-LION和一系列指令跟随数据集。为了促进开放研究和可重复性，我们公开发布了所有训练数据、代码和最终模型权重，采用Apache-2许可证。为了评估上下文理解能力，我们使用两个泰语MRC数据集XQuAD和Iapp_wiki_qa_squad进行了广泛的实验研究。实验结果表明，在0-shot和1-shot设置下，模型能够理解上下文并产生与参考答案一致的回答。此外，我们的评估超越了传统的MRC。我们提出了一个新的评估方案，评估答案的正确性、帮助性、简洁性和上下文性。评估结果揭示了我们如何改进模型的见解。",
