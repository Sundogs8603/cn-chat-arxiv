Based on the patient's responses to the stimuli, the visual field mapping and sensitivity are determined.

In this work, we present RLPeri, a reinforcement learning-based approach to optimize visual perimetry testing.

    "translated_abstract": "视野测定是一项帮助检测由眼部或神经系统疾病引起的视力问题的重要眼部检查。在测试过程中，患者将凝视在特定位置，同时在中心和周围视野呈现不同强度的光刺激。根据患者对刺激的反应，确定视野映射和敏感度。然而，对患者来说在整个测试过程中保持高度集中可能具有挑战性，导致检查时间增加，精度降低。 在这项工作中，我们提出了RLPeri，一种基于强化学习的方法来优化视野测定测试。通过确定最佳位置顺序和初始刺激值，我们的目标是减少检查时间而不影响准确度。此外，我们还采用奖励塑形技术来进一步提高测试性能。",
