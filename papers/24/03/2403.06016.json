LOD logs have experienced significant growth due to the large exploitation of LOD datasets. However, exploiting these logs is a difficult task because of their complex structure. Moreover, these logs suffer from many risks related to their Quality and Provenance, impacting their trust. To tackle these issues, we start by clearly defining the ecosystem of LOD query-logs.

    "translated_abstract": "从利用查询日志中获取的对用户兴趣和偏好的深刻理解，推动了支柱领域的重要进展。深入了解用户提供了有用的知识，可以对决策产生强烈影响。本研究旨在从链接开放数据（LOD）查询日志中提取有价值的信息。LOD日志由于对LOD数据集的大规模利用而经历了显著增长。然而，利用这些日志是一项艰巨的任务，因为它们具有复杂的结构。此外，这些日志遭受与它们的质量和来源相关的许多风险，影响了它们的可信度。为解决这些问题，我们首先清晰定义了LOD查询日志的生态系统。然后，我们提供了一个端到端的解决方案来利用这些日志。最后，使用真实的LOD日志，并进行了一系列实验来验证所提出的解决方案。",
