We show that several key results from Pathak and S\\\"onmez (2008) qualitatively flip: A sophisticated student may prefer for a sincere student to become sophisticated, and a sophisticated student may prefer for her own district to use Deferred Acceptance over the Boston Mechanism, irrespective of the mechanism used by the other district.

    "translated_abstract": "我们将Pathak和S\\\"onmez (2008)的开创性模型扩展到一个具有多个学区的环境中，每个学区都运行其自己的独立中心化匹配，重点关注两个学区的情况。在我们的设置中，除了每个学生是真诚还是老练之外，她还可以是受限制的 - 只能申请自己居住学区内的学校 - 或不受限制的 - 能够选择任何一个学区进行申请。我们展示了 Pathak和S\\\"onmez (2008) 中的几个关键结果在性质上发生了变化： 一个老练的学生可能希望一个真诚的学生变得老练，一个老练的学生可能更喜欢自己所在学区使用延迟接受而不是波士顿机制，而不考虑其他学区使用的机制。我们进一步研究了学生对其他学生受限水平的偏好。其中许多现象大量出现在大规模的随机中。",
    "tldr": "在多个学区的环境中，学生的真诚或老练以及受限制程度的选择会影响他们的选择偏好，研究发现一些关键结果出现颠倒，学生之间的互动会导致学区选择机制的不同偏好。",
    "en_tdlr": "In a setting with multiple school districts, students' sincerity or sophistication, as well as the level of constraint, affect their choice preferences. The study finds that several key results are flipped, and interactions among students lead to different preferences of school district selection mechanisms."
