    "translated_abstract": "由于其巨大的应用潜力，大规模场景生成在学术界和工业界引起了广泛关注。最近的研究采用强大的生成模型创建所需的场景，并取得了令人期待的结果。然而，大多数这些方法使用不兼容工业流程的3D基元（如点云或辐射场）来表示场景，这导致学术研究与工业部署之间存在重大差距。程序化可控生成（PCG）是一种高效的技术，可创建可扩展和高质量的资产，但对普通用户不友好，因为它需要深入的领域专业知识。为解决这些问题，我们采用大型语言模型（LLM）驱动程序化建模。在本文中，我们介绍了一个大规模场景生成框架SceneX，可以根据设计师的文本描述自动生成高质量的程序化模型。",
