    "translated_abstract": "无需训练的度量（即零成本代理）被广泛用于避免资源密集型的神经网络训练，尤其是在神经结构搜索（NAS）中。最近的研究表明，现有的无需训练的度量存在一些局限，比如在不同搜索空间和任务之间存在有限的关联性和差劲的泛化能力。因此，我们提出了样本级激活模式及其衍生物SWAP-Score，这是一种新颖的高性能无需训练的度量。它测量了网络在一批输入样本上的表现能力。SWAP-Score与不同搜索空间和任务中的真实性能强相关，在NAS-Bench-101/201/301和TransNAS-Bench-101上胜过了15种现有的无需训练的度量。SWAP-Score可以通过正则化进一步增强，这在基于单元的搜索空间中可以实现更高的相关性，并且在搜索过程中实现模型大小控制。例如，Spearman的排序",
