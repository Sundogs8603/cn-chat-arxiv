    "translated_abstract": "资源效率在当前机器学习中扮演着重要角色。能量消耗和决策延迟是保证可持续和实际应用的两个关键方面。不幸的是，能量消耗和决策延迟不具备对抗性。研究人员最近表明，攻击者可以在推断时计算并提交所谓的海绵示例，从而增加神经网络的能量消耗和决策延迟。在计算机视觉中，所提出的策略制作了具有较低激活稀疏度的输入，而这些输入本来可以用于加速计算。本文分析了这些能量-延迟攻击是如何减少激活稀疏度的机理。特别地，我们发现输入的统一性是关键的推动因素。统一图像，也就是大部分为平坦、颜色均匀的表面构成的图像，由于卷积、批量规范化等特定相互作用，会触发更多的激活。",
    "tldr": "统一输入会降低计算机视觉任务中的激活稀疏度，增加能量消耗和决策延迟，攻击者利用这一点提交海绵示例对神经网络进行攻击。"
