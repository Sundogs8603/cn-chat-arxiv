Editing LVLMs faces the challenge of effectively integrating diverse modalities (image and text) while ensuring coherent and contextually relevant modifications. An existing benchmark has three metrics (Reliability, Locality and Generality) to measure knowledge editing for LVLMs. However, the benchmark falls short in the quality of generated images used in evaluation and cannot assess whether models effectively utilize edited knowledge in relation to the associated content. We adopt different data collection methods to construct a new benchmark, $\\textbf{KEBench}$, and extend new metric (Portability) for a comprehensive evaluation. Leveraging a multimodal knowledge graph, our image data exhibits clear directionality towards entities. This directional aspect can be further utilized to extract entity-related knowledge and form editing ",

    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.07350v1 公告类型: 跨领域 摘要: 目前，针对大型视觉-语言模型(LVLMs)的知识编辑研究很少。编辑LVLMs面临着有效整合多种模态（图像和文本）的挑战，同时确保修改连贯且与上下文相关。现有基准测试具有三个度量标准（可靠性、局部性和一般性）用于衡量LVLMs的知识编辑。然而，该基准测试在评估中使用的生成图像质量不足，并且无法评估模型是否有效地利用与相关内容相关的编辑知识。我们采用不同的数据收集方法构建了一个新的基准测试$\\textbf{KEBench}$，并扩展了新度量标准(可移植性)以进行全面评估。借助多模态知识图，我们的图像数据呈现出明确的给实体方向性。这种方向性可以进一步用于提取与实体相关的知识和进行编辑。",
