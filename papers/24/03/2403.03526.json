    "translated_abstract": "大脑计算机接口（BCI）技术促进了人脑与计算机之间的交流，主要利用脑电图（EEG）信号来识别人类意图。尽管针对瘫痪患者已开发了基于EEG的BCI系统，但正在进行的研究探索了语言想象和运动想象（MI）系统。本研究介绍了 FingerNet，这是一种专门用于精细MI分类的网络，偏离了传统的粗糙MI研究。所提出的 FingerNet 可以从 EEG 信号中提取空间和时间特征，提高了在同一只手内的分类准确度。实验结果表明，在分类五个手指敲击任务（拇指、食指、中指、无名指和小指运动）方面性能显示出显著较高的准确度。与传统基准模型 EEGNet 和 DeepConvNet 相比，FingerNet 表现出卓越的性能。",
