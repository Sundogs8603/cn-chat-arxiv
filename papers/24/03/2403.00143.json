We propose to build an ensemble of different runs of the existing discontinuous parser by averaging the predicted trees, to stabilize and boost performance. To begin with, we provide comprehensive computational complexity analysis (in terms of P and NP-complete) for tree averaging under different setups of binarity and continuity. We then develop an efficient exact algorithm to tackle the task, which runs in a reasonable time for all samples in our experiments. Results on three datasets show our method outperforms all baselines in all metrics; we also provide in-depth analyses of our approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了无监督不连续成分句法分析的问题，在这个问题中我们观察到先前唯一模型的性能存在高方差。我们提出通过对现有不连续解析器的不同运行构建一个集成，并通过平均预测树来稳定和提升性能。首先，我们针对不同的二元性和连续性设置提供了全面的树平均计算复杂度分析（以P和NP完全为单位）。然后，我们开发了一种高效的精确算法来处理这一任务，在我们的实验中对所有样本运行时间均合理。在三个数据集上的结果显示我们的方法在所有指标上均优于所有基准线，我们还对我们的方法进行了深入分析。",
