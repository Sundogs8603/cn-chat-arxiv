    "translated_abstract": "合作式边缘计算（CEC）已成为一种有前途的范式，使边缘节点能够协作并从终端设备执行微服务。 微服务卸载是一个根本重要的问题，它在服务到达时决定何时以及在何处执行微服务。然而，现实世界CEC环境的动态特性经常导致低效的微服务卸载策略，从而导致资源利用不足和网络拥塞。为解决这一挑战，我们制定了一个在线联合微服务卸载和带宽分配问题JMOBA，以最小化服务的平均完成时间。在本文中，我们介绍了一种新颖的微服务卸载算法DTDRLMO，它利用深度强化学习（DRL）和数字孪生技术。具体来说，我们采用数字孪生技术实时预测并适应CEC边缘节点负载和网络条件的变化。",
