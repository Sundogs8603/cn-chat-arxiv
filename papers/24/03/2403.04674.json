    "translated_abstract": "在随机组合理论框架下，我们引入了用于长期时间跨度下大型股票市场的排名波动率稳定模型。这些模型是Fernholz & Karatzas于2005年引入的波动率稳定模型的排名扩展。在理论方面，我们确立了模型的全局存在性以及引发的排名市场权重的遍历性。我们还推导了增长最优投资组合的显式表达，并展示了相对于市场组合的相对套利存在性。在实证方面，我们对模型进行了校准，使其与16年的CRSP美国股票数据匹配（i）基于排名的波动率，（ii）由市场权重碰撞测量的股票周转率，（iii）平均市场回报率以及（iv）资本分布曲线。对模型拟合度和误差分析进行了样本内外的评估。据我们所知，这是第一个展示相对波动率的模型。",
