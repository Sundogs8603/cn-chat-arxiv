    "translated_abstract": "跨模态检索（CMR）旨在建立不同模态之间的交互，其中监督式CMR由于在学习语义类别识别上的灵活性而变得越来越受欢迎。尽管先前的监督式CMR方法表现出色，但它们的成功很大程度上归因于良好注释的数据。然而，即使对于单模态数据，精确的注释也是昂贵且耗时的，而在多模态场景下变得更具挑战性。在实践中，从互联网收集了大量具有粗糙注释的多模态数据，这必然导致有噪声的标签。使用这些误导性标签进行训练会带来两个关键挑战--强制多模态样本\\emph{对齐不正确的语义}和\\emph{扩大异质性差距}，从而导致检索性能不佳。为了解决这些挑战，本文提出了UOT-RCL，一个基于最优输运（OT）的统一框架",
