    "translated_abstract": "在稀疏约束优化（SCO）上应用迭代求解器需要繁琐的数学推导和仔细的编程/调试，这限制了这些求解器的广泛影响。本文介绍了库skscope，以克服此障碍。借助skscope，用户只需编写目标函数即可解决SCO问题。本文通过两个例子演示了skscope的方便之处，其中只需四行代码就可以解决稀疏线性回归和趋势过滤。更重要的是，skscope的高效实现使得最先进的求解器可以快速获得稀疏解，而无需考虑参数空间的高维度。数值实验显示，skscope中的可用求解器可以实现比基准凸求解器获得的竞争松弛解高达80倍的加速度。skscope已经发布在Python软件包索引（PyPI）和Conda上。",
