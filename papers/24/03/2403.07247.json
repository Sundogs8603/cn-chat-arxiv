    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.07247v1 公告类型：交叉 摘要：为了收集带有图像和相应标签的大型医学数据集而进行的注释负担和大量工作很少是划算且令人望而生畏的。这导致了缺乏丰富的训练数据，削弱了下游任务，并在一定程度上加剧了医学领域面临的图像分析挑战。作为一种权宜之计，鉴于生成性神经模型的最近成功，现在可以在外部约束的引导下以高保真度合成图像数据集。本文探讨了这种可能性，并提出了GuideGen：一种联合生成腹部器官和结直肠癌CT图像和组织掩膜的管线，其受文本提示条件约束。首先，我们介绍了体积掩膜采样器，以适应掩膜标签的离散分布并生成低分辨率3D组织掩膜。其次，我们的条件图像生成器会在收到相应文本提示的情况下自回归生成CT切片。",
