To reduce risks of leaking private information contained in the retrieved set, we introduce Copy-Protected generation with Retrieval (CPR), a new method for RAG with strong copyright protection guarantees in a mixed-private setting for diffusion models.CPR allows to condition the output of diffusion models on a set of retrieved images, while also guaranteeing that unique identifiable information about those example is not exposed in the generated outputs.

    "translated_abstract": "检索增强生成（RAG）正日益成为一种灵活且强大的技术，使模型能够适应私人用户数据而无需训练，处理信用归因，并允许规模化的高效机器遗忘。然而，图像生成的RAG技术可能导致模型输出中的部分检索样本被复制。为了减少泄漏检索集中包含的私人信息的风险，我们引入了带有检索的受版权保护生成（CPR），这是一种新的用于扩散模型的RAG方法，在混合私人设置中提供了强大的版权保护保证。CPR允许将扩散模型的输出条件设置为一组检索到的图像，同时还保证不会在生成的输出中暴露关于这些示例的独特可识别信息。特别是通过从合并它们的扩散概率分布进行抽样来实现这一点。",
