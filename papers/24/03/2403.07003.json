The objective of this work is to propose a set of coordinated technological solutions to transform an existing emergency response system into an intelligent interactive system, thereby improving the public services and the quality of life for residents at home, on road, in hospitals, transport hubs, etc. In this context, we consider a city wide view from three different application scenes that are closely related to peoples daily life, to optimize the actions taken at relevant departments.
