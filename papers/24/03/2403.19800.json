    "translated_abstract": "重构时变图信号（或图时间序列插补）是机器学习和信号处理中的一个关键问题，具有广泛的应用，从传感器网络中的缺失数据插补到时间序列预测。准确捕捉这些信号固有的时空信息对于有效解决这些任务至关重要。然而，现有方法依赖于时间差的平滑性假设和简单的凸优化技术，存在固有限制。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种结合学习模块以增强下游任务准确性的新方法。为此，我们引入基于Gegenbauer多项式理论的Gegenbauer-based graph convolutional（GegenConv）算子，这是传统切比雪夫图卷积的推 generalization。",
