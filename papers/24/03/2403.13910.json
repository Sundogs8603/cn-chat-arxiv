However, its practicality has been limited due to its requirement that users be trained in operating real robot arms to provide demonstrations. This paper presents an innovative solution: an Augmented Reality (AR)-assisted framework for demonstration collection, empowering non-roboticist users to produce demonstrations for robot IL using devices like the HoloLens 2. Our framework facilitates scalable and diverse demonstration collection for real-world tasks. We validate our approach with experiments on three classical robotics tasks: reach, push, and pick-and-place. The real robot performs each task successfully while replaying demonstrations collected via AR.",

    "translated_abstract": "机器人模仿学习（IL）是一种广泛使用的方法，用于训练机器人执行涉及模仿人类演示以获取技能的操纵任务。然而，由于其要求用户接受操作真实机器人手臂的培训来提供演示，其实用性受到限制。本文提出了一种创新性解决方案：一种辅助增强现实（AR）框架用于演示收集，赋予非机器人专家用户使用HoloLens 2等设备为机器人IL制作演示的能力。我们的框架为现实世界的任务提供了可扩展和多样化的演示收集。我们通过对三个经典机器人任务（抓取、推动和拾取放置）的实验验证了我们的方法。真实机器人在回放通过AR收集的演示时成功执行每项任务。",
