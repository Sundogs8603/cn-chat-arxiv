    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了一种通用的算法解决方案，解决了社会变革组织在资源受限外展中遇到的问题，这些组织拥有不同的使命和运营方式：Breaking Ground——一家帮助纽约无家可归者过渡至永久住房的组织和以色列全国食品银行Leket。具体地，我们针对部分观测的周期性不安定赌徒问题在$k$-步转移下开发了一种估计和优化方法。结果表明，我们提出的Thompson抽样与具有马尔可夫链恢复（通过Stein变分梯度下降）的算法在两个组织的问题上明显优于基线。我们以远景方式进行了这项工作，旨在设计一个足够灵活但也足够有用的解决方案，以帮助克服对数据可持续影响缺乏的问题。",
