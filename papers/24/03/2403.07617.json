    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.07617v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We report the results of surveys we conducted in the US and Israel in 2020, a time when many prices increased following the spread of the pandemic. To assess respondents perceptions of price increases, we focus on goods whose prices have increased during the pandemic, including some essential goods. Consistent with the principle of dual entitlement, we find that respondents perceive price increases as more acceptable if they are due to cost shocks than if they are due to demand shocks. However, we also find large differences across the two populations, as well as across goods.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们报告了我们在2020年在美国和以色列进行的调查结果，当时随着疫情传播，许多价格出现了上涨。为了评估受访者对价格上涨的看法，我们关注了在疫情期间价格上涨的商品，包括一些必需品。与双重权利原则一致，我们发现如果价格上涨是由成本冲击引起的，受访者认为这种情况更为可接受，而如果是由需求冲击导致的，则认为不太可接受。然而，我们还发现两个种群以及商品之间存在很大的差异。",
    "tldr": "受疫情影响，调查显示人们更容忍基于成本冲击而非需求冲击的价格上涨，不过不同种群及商品之间存在较大差异。",
