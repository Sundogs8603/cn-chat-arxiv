    "translated_abstract": "协作解决问题（CPS）是一项关键技能，既在职场中使用，也在教育环境中使用。CPS对于解决日益复杂的全球、经济和政治问题非常有用，并被认为是21世纪的核心技能。日益连接的全球社区为具有不同视角的创造性和协作式问题解决互动与解决方案提供了丰富的机会。不幸的是，妇女和少数群体（URMs）在协作互动中经常面临障碍，这些障碍阻碍了他们在这些问题解决对话中的重要参与。在这里，我们探讨了少数群体和非少数群体在CPS任务中共同工作的沟通模式。集团沟通分析（GCA），一种时间敏感的计算语言工具，被用来研究URM身份如何影响个体的社会认知语言模式。结果显示了差异。",
