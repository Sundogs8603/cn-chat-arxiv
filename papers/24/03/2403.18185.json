Using both types of information, agents engage in Bayesian non-parametric estimation of the unknown action value function. Reasoning signals are produced internally through mental deliberation, subject to a cognitive cost. Experience signals are the observed utility outcomes at previous actions. Agents' subjective estimation uncertainty, which evolves through information accumulation, modulates the two modes of learning in a state- and history-dependent way. We discuss how the model draws on and bridges conceptual, methodological and empirical insights from both economics and the cognitive sciences literature on reinforcement learning.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了一个新的框架，研究了在认知摩擦下有限理性的学习过程，这个框架通过深思熟虑的推理和积累的经验来研究学习最佳行为。代理通过这两种信息进行贝叶斯非参数估计未知的行为价值函数。推理信号通过心理沉思内部产生，受认知成本影响。经验信号是先前行动的观察效用结果。代理的主观估计不确定性，通过信息累积演变，以状态和历史依赖的方式调节两种学习模式。我们讨论了该模型如何借鉴和连接经济学和认知科学文献中关于强化学习的概念、方法论和实证见解。",
