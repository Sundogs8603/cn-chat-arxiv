    "translated_abstract": "使用野外数据精确进行人体网格恢复是一项艰巨的挑战，往往受到深度不明确和降低精度的阻碍。现有作品要么借助姿势先验，要么利用多模态数据（如多视图或点云信息），尽管它们的方法经常忽视单个图像中天然存在的宝贵场景深度信息。此外，由于姿势、形状和深度的固有变化，针对分布外数据（OOD）实现稳健的HMR极具挑战性。因此，理解人体形态建模的潜在分布成为一个重要子问题。出于对明确和稳健人体建模的需求，我们引入了分布和深度感知人体网格恢复（D2A-HMR），这是一种端到端的变压器架构，经过精心设计，旨在最小化分布之间的差异并整合场景深度，利用先前的深度信息。",
