Diving deeper, the science stakeholder for those AI applications are Deep Generative Models, a.k.a DGMs, which are designed to learn the underlying distribution of the data and generate new data points that are statistically similar to the original dataset. One critical question is raised: how can we leverage DGMs into morden retail supply chain realm? To address this question, this paper expects to provide a comprehensive review of DGMs and discuss their existing and potential usecases in retail supply chain, by (1) providing a taxonomy and overview of state-of-the-art DGMs and their variants, (2) reviewing existing DGM applications in retail supply chain from a end-to-end view of point, and (3) discussing insights and potential directions on how DGMs can be further utilized on solving retail ",
