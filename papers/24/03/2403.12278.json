We provide novel theoretical evidence, supported by extensive experimental evaluation that, with high probability, the smallest singular value of a stochastically rounded matrix is well bounded away from zero -- regardless of how close $\\mathbf{A}$ is to being rank deficient and even if $\\mathbf{A}$ is rank-deficient. In other words, stochastic rounding \\textit{implicitly regularizes} tall and skinny matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ so that the rounded version has full column rank. Our proofs leverage powerful results in random matrix theory, and the idea that stochastic rounding errors do not concentrate in low-dimensional column spaces.",
