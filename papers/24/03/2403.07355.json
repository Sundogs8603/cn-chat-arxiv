    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种基于有限速率深度学习（DL）的信道状态信息（CSI）反馈方法，用于大规模多输入多输出（MIMO）系统。该方法在矢量量化变分自动编码器（VQ-VAE）框架下提供了潜在矢量的有限位表示，同时基于形状增益矢量量化减少了计算复杂度。在这种方法中，潜在矢量的幅度使用合适的转换函数和非均匀标量码本进行量化，而潜在矢量的方向则使用可训练的Grassmann码本进行量化。通过引入一个用于嵌套码本的码字选择规则和损失函数设计，还开发了一种多速率码本设计策略。仿真结果表明，所提出的方法降低了与VQ-VAE相关的计算复杂度，同时改善了CSI重建性能。",
