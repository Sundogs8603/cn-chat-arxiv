    "translated_abstract": "由于云系统的规模和复杂性，系统故障会引发“警报风暴”，即大量相关的警报。尽管这些警报可以追溯到少数几个根本原因，但压倒性的数量使人工处理变得不可行。因此，警报聚合对帮助工程师集中精力解决根本原因并促进故障解决至关重要。现有方法通常利用基于语义相似性的方法或统计方法来聚合警报。然而，基于语义相似性的方法忽视了警报的因果推理，而统计方法几乎无法处理不经常发生的警报。 为了解决这些限制，我们介绍了利用外部知识，即警报的标准操作规程（SOP）作为补充。我们提出了一种基于相关挖掘和LLM（Large Language Model）推理的在线警报聚合的新型混合方法COLA。",
