    "translated_abstract": "大规模高分辨率（HR）土地覆盖映射是调查地球表面和解决人类面临的许多挑战的重要任务。然而，由于复杂的地面细节、各种地貌和广泛地理区域内准确训练标签的稀缺性，这仍然是一项非平凡的任务。在本文中，我们提出了一个高效的弱监督框架（Paraformer），即低到高网络（L2HNet）V2，用于在低分辨率（LR）的易获历史土地覆盖数据指导大规模高分辨率土地覆盖映射。具体来说，现有的土地覆盖映射方法显示了CNN在保留局部地面细节方面的优势，但仍然存在在各种地貌中全局建模不足的问题。因此，我们设计了Paraformer中的并行CNN-Transformer特征提取器，包括一个无降采样CNN分支和一个Transformer分支，来共同捕获局部和全局背景信息",
