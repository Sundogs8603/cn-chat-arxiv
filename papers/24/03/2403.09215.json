In this work, we focus on evaluating model performance of Gaussian process models, i.e. finding a metric that provides the best trade-off between all those criteria. While previous work considers metrics like the likelihood, AIC or dynamic nested sampling, they either lack performance or have significant runtime issues, which severely limits applicability. We address these challenges by introducing multiple metrics based on the Laplace approximation, where we overcome a severe inconsistency occuring during naive application of the Laplace approximation. Experiments show that our metrics are comparable in quality to the gold standard dynamic nested sampling without compromising for computational speed. Our model selection criteria allow significantly faster and high quality model selection of Gaussian process models.",

    "translated_abstract": "模型选择旨在找到在准确性、可解释性或简易性方面最佳的模型，最好是三者兼顾。本研究着重于评估高斯过程模型的模型性能，即找到一个提供所有这些准则之间最佳权衡的度量标准。我们引入了基于Laplace逼近的多种度量标准来应对以往工作中存在的性能不佳或具有严重运行时间问题的情况，从而极大地限制了适用性。实验表明，我们的度量标准在质量上与黄金标准动态嵌套抽样相当，而又不会影响计算速度。我们的模型选择标准使得高斯过程模型的模型选择能够更快速地且生成质量更高的结果。",
