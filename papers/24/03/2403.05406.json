    "translated_abstract": "多元时间序列（MTS）的预测长期以来一直是一项重要但具有挑战性的任务。由于跨越长时间步的非平稳问题，先前的研究主要采用平稳化方法来减弱原始系列的非平稳问题，以获得更好的可预测性。然而，现有方法总是采用平稳化的系列，忽略了固有的非平稳性，并且由于缺乏随机性，很难对具有复杂分布的MTS进行建模。为了解决这些问题，我们首先开发了一个强大的层次概率生成模块，考虑了MTS中的非平稳性和随机特性，然后将其与Transformer结合，形成一个名为Hierarchical Time series Variational Transformer（HTV-Trans）的明确定义的变分生成动态模型，将内在的非平稳信息恢复到时间依赖关系中。",
    "tldr": "论文提出了一种名为HTV-Trans的Hierarchical Time series Variational Transformer模型，通过结合层次概率生成模块和Transformer，能够有效考虑多元时间序列中的非平稳性和随机特性，从而更好地回复时间依赖关系。",
