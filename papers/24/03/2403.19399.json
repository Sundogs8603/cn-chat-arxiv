    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.19399v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce KazParC, a parallel corpus designed for machine translation across Kazakh, English, Russian, and Turkish. The first and largest publicly available corpus of its kind, KazParC contains a collection of 371,902 parallel sentences covering different domains and developed with the assistance of human translators. Our research efforts also extend to the development of a neural machine translation model nicknamed Tilmash. Remarkably, the performance of Tilmash is on par with, and in certain instances, surpasses that of industry giants, such as Google Translate and Yandex Translate, as measured by standard evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and chrF. Both KazParC and Tilmash are openly available for download under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0) through our GitHub repository.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了KazParC，这是一个为跨哈萨克语、英语、俄语和土耳其语进行机器翻译而设计的平行语料库。作为其类别中首个也是最大的公开可用语料库，KazParC包含了371,902个平行句子的集合，涵盖不同领域，并在人类译者的协助下开发。我们的研究工作还扩展到了发展一个被昵称为Tilmash的神经机器翻译模型。引人注目的是，Tilmash的表现与工业巨头，如Google翻译和Yandex翻译，在标准评估指标（如BLEU和chrF）的基础上相媲美，并在某些情况下甚至超越。KazParC和Tilmash均可通过我们的GitHub存储库以知识共享署名4.0国际许可（CC BY 4.0）公开下载。",
