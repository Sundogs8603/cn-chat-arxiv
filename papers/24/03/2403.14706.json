This study contributes to marketing literature and practice in three ways. First, it demonstrates the proficiency of AI in fabricating disinformative user-generated content (UGC) that mimics the form of authentic content. Second, it quantifies the disruptive impact of such UGC on marketing research, highlighting the susceptibility of analytics frameworks to even minimal levels of disinformation.

    "translated_abstract": "生成式人工智能带来了生成内容几乎能够模仿人类贡献的能力，引入了一种前所未有的威胁：这些模型的大规模部署可以用来操纵公众舆论和扭曲认知，导致对数字平台的信任下降。本研究在营销文献和实践方面做出了三方面贡献。首先，它展示了人工智能在制造模仿真实内容形式的误导性用户生成内容（UGC）方面的熟练程度。其次，它量化了这种UGC对营销研究的扰乱影响，突显了即使是最低水平的虚假信息也会使分析框架受到影响的脆弱性。第三，它提出并评估了高级检测框架，揭示了标准技术无法过滤掉人工智能生成的虚假信息。我们主张采取综合性方法来保护营销研究，整合",
