    "translated_abstract": "自动合规检查（ACC）在建筑、工程和施工（AEC）领域内的自动合规检查需要自动解释建筑法规，以发挥其全部潜力。然而，从文本规则中提取信息以将其转换为机器可读格式由于自然语言的复杂性以及仅能支持先进的机器学习技术的有限资源而成为一个挑战。为了解决这一挑战，我们介绍了一个独特的数据集CODE-ACCORD，这是在欧盟Horizon ACCORD项目下编制的。CODE-ACCORD包含862个来自英格兰和芬兰建筑法规的自包含句子。与我们的核心目标一致，即促进从文本中提取信息以生成机器可读规则，每个句子都注释了实体和关系。实体代表特定组件，如“窗户”和“烟雾探测器”，而re",
