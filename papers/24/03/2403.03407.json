The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) promises better decision-making and increased military effectiveness. However, there is still debate about how AI systems, especially large language models (LLMs), behave as compared to humans. To this end, we use a wargame experiment with 107 national security expert human players designed to look at crisis escalation in a fictional US-China scenario and compare human players to LLM-simulated responses. We find considerable agreement in the LLM and human responses but also significant quantitative and qualitative differences between simulated and human players in the wargame, motivating caution to policymakers before handing over autonomy or following AI-based strategy recommendations.",

    "translated_abstract": "战争游戏在军事战略的发展和国家对威胁或攻击的响应中有着悠久的历史。人工智能（AI）的出现承诺了更好的决策制定和增强的军事效果。然而，关于AI系统，尤其是大型语言模型（LLMs），与人类的行为有何不同仍存在争议。为此，我们进行了一项战争游戏实验，共有107位国家安全专家人类参与者参与，旨在研究在一个虚构的美中情景中的危机升级，并比较人类参与者与LLM模拟响应之间的差异。我们发现LLM和人类响应存在显著一致性，但在战争游戏中模拟和人类参与者之间也存在显著的定量和定性差异，这促使决策者在交出自主权或遵循基于AI的战略建议之前谨慎对待。",
