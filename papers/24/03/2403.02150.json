    "translated_abstract": "在工艺行业中，时间序列建模面对处理复杂、多方面和不断演变的数据特征的挑战。传统的单一模型方法往往难以捕捉多样动态之间的相互作用，导致预测不够优化。因此，我们引入了Recency-Weighted Temporally-Segmented（ReWTS，发音为`roots'）集成模型，这是一种新颖的基于块的多步预测方法。ReWTS模型的关键特征有两个：1）通过将训练数据划分为数据块并对每个块训练一个模型，有助于将模型专门化为不同的动态。2）在推断阶段，一个优化过程评估最近的过去中的每个模型，并选择活动模型，以便能够召回以前学习的动态的适当混合来预测未来。这种方法不仅捕捉了每个时期的细微差异，而且能够自适应。",
