The Cobb angle is a widely used scoliosis quantification method that measures the degree of curvature between the tilted vertebrae. Yet, manual measuring of Cobb angles is time-consuming and labor-intensive, fraught with significant interobserver and intraobserver variability. To address these challenges and the lack of interpretability found in certain existing automated methods, we have created fully automated software that not only precisely measures the Cobb angle but also provides clear visualizations of these measurements.

    "translated_abstract": "脊柱侧凸是一种常见疾病，其特点是脊柱异常曲度导致畸形，需要精确的评估方法以进行有效的诊断和管理。 Cobb 角度是一种广泛使用的脊柱侧凸量化方法，用于测量倾斜椎骨之间的曲度程度。然而，手动测量 Cobb 角度耗时且劳动密集，存在着显著的观察者间和观察者内的差异性。为了解决这些挑战以及某些现有自动化方法中缺乏可解释性的问题，我们创建了完全自动化的软件，不仅可以精确测量 Cobb 角度，还可以清晰可视化这些测量结果。该软件集成了基于深度神经网络的脊柱区域检测和分割、脊柱中心线识别、标记最明显倾斜的椎骨以及在原始图像上直接可视化 Cobb 角度等功能。",
