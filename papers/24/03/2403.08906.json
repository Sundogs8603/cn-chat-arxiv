We quantify how much a strategically sophisticated agent can exploit a naive Q-learner if she knows the opponent's Q-learning algorithm. To this end, we formulate the strategic actor's problem as a Markov decision process (with a continuum state space encompassing all possible Q-values) as if the Q-learning algorithm is the underlying dynamical system.

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我们探讨了Q-learning算法(一种经典且广泛使用的强化学习方法)在游戏中对策略性对手的敏感性。我们量化了如果策略性对手了解对手的Q-learning算法，她可以利用一个天真的Q-学习者多少。为此，我们将策略行为者的问题构建为一个马尔可夫决策过程(具有涵盖所有可能Q值的连续状态空间)，就好像Q-学习算法是底层动态系统一样。我们还提出了一个基于量化的近似方案来处理连续状态空间，并在理论和数值上分析了其性能。",
