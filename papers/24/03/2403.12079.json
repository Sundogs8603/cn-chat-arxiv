This study aims to explore the predictive power of various machine learning models in forecasting song popularity using a dataset comprising 30,000 songs spanning different genres from 1957 to 2020. Methods: We employ Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms to analyse song characteristics and their impact on popularity.

    "translated_abstract": "音乐流行度预测引起了工业界和学术界的极大关注，这得益于数据驱动算法和Spotify等流媒体平台的兴起。本研究旨在探讨使用涵盖1957年至2020年各种流派的30,000首歌曲数据集，探讨各种机器学习模型在预测歌曲流行度方面的预测能力。通过普通最小二乘（OLS）、多元自适应回归样条（MARS）、随机森林和XGBoost算法来分析歌曲特征及其对流行度的影响。研究结果显示，普通最小二乘（OLS）回归分析表明流派是流行度的主要影响因素，而且随时间可见显著的趋势。MARS建模突出了变量之间的复杂关系，尤其是与特征如器乐度和时长相关。随机森林和XGBoost模型强调了流派，尤其是电子舞曲在预测中的重要性。",
