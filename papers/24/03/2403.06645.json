    "translated_abstract": "从MRI大脑扫描中自动提取特征并诊断阿尔茨海默病是一个持续挑战。随着3D成像技术的进步，3D数据采集比其2D对应物更具可行性和效率。本文首次提出了一种流水线，从皮层表面利用Ricci能量优化提取新颖的基于协方差的描述符，而非使用基于特征的向量。这些协方差描述符是对称正定矩阵的非线性流形的组成部分，因此我们专注于使用高斯径向基函数将基于流形的分类应用于3D形状问题。将这一新颖特征应用于异常皮层脑形态学分析中，可以用于诊断阿尔茨海默病。在大约两百个3D MRI大脑模型上进行的实验研究，这些模型来自阿尔茨海默病神经影像学倡议 (ADNI) 数据集",
