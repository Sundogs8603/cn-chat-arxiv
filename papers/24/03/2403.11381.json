This paper explores the cooperative capabilities of Large Language Model-augmented Autonomous Agents (LAAs) using the well-known Meltin Pot environments along with reference models such as GPT4 and GPT3.5. Preliminary results suggest that while these agents demonstrate a propensity for cooperation, they still struggle with effective collaboration in given environments, emphasizing the need for more robust architectures.

    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能领域的不断发展，其中一个重要维度是发展大型语言模型及其潜力增强多代理人人工智能系统。本文通过使用著名的Meltin Pot环境以及参考模型如GPT4和GPT3.5，探讨了大型语言模型增强的自主代理(LAAs)的合作能力。初步结果表明，尽管这些代理人表现出合作的倾向，但在特定环境中仍然难以实现有效的协作，强调了更强大架构的需求。本研究的贡献包括一个用于适应LLM的Melting Pot游戏场景的抽象化层，一个用于LLM中介代理开发的可重用架构-包括短期和长期记忆以及不同的认知模块，并使用一组方法评估合作能力。",
