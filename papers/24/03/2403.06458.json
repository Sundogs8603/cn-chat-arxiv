One example of a physical target value is the wort density, which is an important value needed for beer production. This article introduces a system that helps the brewer measure wort density through sensors in order to reduce errors in manual data collection. Instead of a direct measurement of wort density, a method is developed that calculates the density from measured values acquired by inexpensive standard sensors such as pressure or temperature. The model behind the calculation is a neural network, known as LSTM.",

    "translated_abstract": "技术过程中许多物理目标值很容易出错、繁琐或昂贵，无法自动测量。麦汁密度是一个物理目标值的例子，对于啤酒生产非常重要。本文介绍了一个系统，通过传感器帮助酿酒师测量麦汁密度，以减少手动数据收集中的错误。方法是使用压力或温度等廉价标准传感器测量到的值来计算密度，而不是直接测量麦汁密度。计算背后的模型是一个名为LSTM的神经网络。",
