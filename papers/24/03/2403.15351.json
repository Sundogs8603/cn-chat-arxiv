    "translated_abstract": "地面文本生成涵盖了诸如长篇问答和摘要等任务，需要内容选择和内容整合。当前的端到端方法由于不透明性而难以控制和解释。因此，最近的研究提出了一种模块化方法，为每个步骤都提供单独的组件。具体而言，我们专注于生成连贯文本的第二子任务，即在多文档环境中给定预选内容。我们将\\textit{Fusion-in-Context}(FiC)具体化为一个独立任务，其输入包括带有目标内容高亮部分的源文本。然后，模型需要生成一个包含所有且仅包含目标信息的连贯段落。我们的工作包括在评论领域开发了一个包含1000个实例的精心策划数据集，以及一个用于评估高亮真实性和涵盖范围的新颖评估框架。",
