    "translated_abstract": "近年来，对于未知约束下的在线凸优化（OCO）问题备受关注。本研究考虑了一个具有静态线性约束的问题版本，玩家会收到嘈杂反馈并且必须始终满足这些约束。通过利用我们创新的乐观安全性设计范式，我们提出了一个算法，该算法在这个问题上的后悔值为$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$。这一改进了以往$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$的最佳后悔值，并且仅使用了略强的独立噪声和无意识对手的假设。然后，通过将这个问题重新构建为在时变随机线性约束下的OCO问题，我们展示了我们的算法在这样的设置下具有相同的后悔值保证，并且从期望上永远不会违反约束。这为OCO在时变随机约束下的文献做出了贡献，其中现有的先进算法",
