We compare Shanghai Stock Exchange A-shares (SSE A-shares) during tranquil periods, with high leverage periods associated with the 2015 subprime mortgage crisis. We use Pearson correlations of returns, the maximum strongly connected subgraph, and $3\\sigma$ principle to iteratively determine the threshold value for building a dynamic correlation network of SSE A-shares. Analyses are carried out based on the networking structure, intra-sector connectivity, and node status, identifying several contributions. First, compared with tranquil periods, the SSE A-shares network experiences a more significant small-world and connective effect during the subprime mortgage crisis and the high leverage period in 2015.

    "translated_abstract": "股市的连接性反映了资本市场的信息效率，对内部风险传染和溢出效应产生影响。我们比较了上海证券交易所A股在宁静时期与与2015年次贷危机相关的高杠杆时期的情况。我们使用收益的Pearson相关系数、最大强连接子图和$3\\sigma$原则来迭代确定构建SSE A股动态相关网络的阈值。基于网络结构、行业内连通性和节点状态进行分析，得出几点贡献。首先，与宁静时期相比，SSE A股网络在次贷危机和2015年高杠杆期间经历了更显著的小世界和连接效应。其次，金融业、能源和公用事业等行业具有更强的行业内连通性。",
