    "translated_abstract": "时间图神经网络（TGNNs）对于建模具有时间变化交互的动态图至关重要，但由于其复杂的模型结构，在可解释性方面面临重大挑战。反事实解释对于理解模型决策至关重要，它研究输入图的变化如何影响结果。本文介绍了两种新颖的 TGNNs 反事实解释方法：GreeDy（动态图的贪心解释器）和 CoDy（动态图的反事实解释器）。它们将解释视为一个搜索问题，寻找改变模型预测的输入图修改。GreeDy 使用简单的贪心方法，而 CoDy 使用复杂的蒙特卡洛树搜索算法。实验证明，两种方法都能有效生成清晰的解释。值得注意的是，CoDy 的性能优于 GreeDy 和现有的事实方法，寻找到重要的反事实输入的成功率提高了高达 59\\%。这突出了 CoDy 的优势。",
