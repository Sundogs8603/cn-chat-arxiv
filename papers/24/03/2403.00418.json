    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.00418v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: News headlines often evoke sentiment by intentionally portraying entities in particular ways, making targeted sentiment analysis (TSA) of headlines a worthwhile but difficult task. Fine-tuned encoder models show satisfactory TSA performance, but their background knowledge is limited, and they require a labeled dataset. LLMs offer a potentially universal solution for TSA due to their broad linguistic and world knowledge along with in-context learning abilities, yet their performance is heavily influenced by prompt design. Drawing parallels with annotation paradigms for subjective tasks, we explore the influence of prompt design on the performance of LLMs for TSA of news headlines. We evaluate the predictive accuracy of state-of-the-art LLMs using prompts with different levels of prescriptiveness, ranging from plain zero-shot to elaborate few-shot prompts matching annotation guidelines. Recognizing the subjective nature of TSA, we evaluate",

    "translated_abstract": "新闻标题常常通过有意识地以特定方式描绘实体来引发情感，这使得新闻标题的有针对性情感分析(TSA)成为一项值得做但具有挑战的任务。微调的编码器模型展现出令人满意的TSA性能，但它们的背景知识有限，需要有标记的数据集。LLMs由于其广泛的语言和世界知识以及上下文学习能力，为TSA提供了一个潜在的通用解决方案，然而它们的性能受提示设计的影响很大。通过与主观任务的注释范式进行类比，我们探讨了提示设计对LLMs在新闻标题TSA中性能的影响。我们评估了使用不同级别的规范提示（从纯粹的零样本到符合注释指南的精心准备的少样本提示）的最先进LLMs的预测准确性。认识到TSA的主观性质，我们评估",
