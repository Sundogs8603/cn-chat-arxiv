While achieving high accuracy in SQL generation is crucial, little is known about the extent to which these text-to-SQL models can reliably handle diverse types of questions encountered during real-world deployment, including unanswerable ones. To explore this aspect, we present TrustSQL, a new benchmark designed to assess the reliability of text-to-SQL models in both single-database and cross-database settings.
