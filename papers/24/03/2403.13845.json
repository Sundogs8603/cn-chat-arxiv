To overcome the issue that the existing ZSFD paradigm cannot learn from evolving streams of training data in industrial scenarios, the incremental ZSFD (IZSFD) paradigm is proposed for the first time, which incorporates category increment and attribute increment for both traditional ZSFD and generalized ZSFD paradigms.

    "translated_abstract": "零样本故障诊断（ZSFD）能够通过预测人类专家标注的故障属性来识别看不见的故障。为了解决工业过程中持续变化的需求，即模型适应新的故障类别和属性而避免忘记先前学到的诊断能力，我们首次提出了增量式ZSFD（IZSFD）范式，它结合了传统ZSFD和广义ZSFD范式的类别增量和属性增量。为了实现IZSFD，我们提出了一个旨在学习新的故障类别和属性的广深混合反遗忘框架（BDMAFF）。为了解决遗忘问题，BDMAFF有效地从两个角度积累先前获得的知识。",
