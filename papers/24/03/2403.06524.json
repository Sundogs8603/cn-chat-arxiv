Our results demonstrate that it is beneficial to separate high-level decision-making processes and low-level control actions between the reinforcement learning agent and the low-level controllers based on physical models. In the following, we study optimizing the performance with a realistic and multi-objective reward function based on Total Cost of Operation (TCOP) of the truck using different approaches; by adding weights to reward components, by normalizing the reward components and by using curriculum learning techniques.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们为自主卡车的战术决策制定了一个基于深度强化学习的框架，特别是针对高速公路场景中的自适应巡航控制（ACC）和变道动作。我们的研究结果表明，在强化学习代理和基于物理模型的低级控制器之间分离高级决策过程和低级控制动作是有益的。接下来，我们研究了通过在卡车的全面运营成本（TCOP）为基础的多目标奖励函数优化性能的不同方法；通过为奖励分量添加权重，通过对奖励分量进行归一化，以及使用课程学习技术。",
