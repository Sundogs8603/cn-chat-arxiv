In such CPHS applications, the human decision-maker may depart from an optimal recommended decision and instead implement a different one for various reasons. In this letter, we develop a rigorous framework to overcome this challenge. In our framework, we consider that humans may deviate from AI recommendations as they perceive and interpret the system's state in a different way than the AI platform. We establish the structural properties of optimal recommendation strategies and develop an approximate human model (AHM) used by the AI. We provide theoretical bounds on the optimality gap that arises from an AHM and illustrate the efficacy of our results in a numerical example.",

    "translated_abstract": "许多网络物理人系统（CPHS）涉及到一个人类决策者，他可能会从人工智能（AI）平台接收推荐，同时又持有最终决策的责任。在这类CPHS应用中，人类决策者可能会因为各种原因而偏离最佳推荐决策，而不是实施另一个。在这封信中，我们开发了一个严格的框架来克服这一挑战。在我们的框架中，我们考虑到人类可能会因为感知和解释系统状态的方式与AI平台不同而偏离AI的推荐。我们建立了最佳推荐策略的结构特性，并开发了AI使用的近似人类模型（AHM）。我们为由AHM产生的最优性差距提供了理论界限，并在一个数值示例中说明了我们结果的功效。",
