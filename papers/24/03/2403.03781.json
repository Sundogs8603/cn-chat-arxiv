    "translated_abstract": "神经网络模型具有许多超参数，必须选择其结构。这对于初学者来说是一个沉重的负担，他们需要选择哪种结构以及分配给参数的值。在大多数情况下，使用默认的超参数和结构。通过评估多种结构，可以显著提高模型准确性。一种称为神经结构搜索（NAS）的过程可以自动评估大量这样的结构。作为本研究的一部分，已开发了一个集成用于图像分类的神经结构搜索开源工具系统（OpenNAS）。OpenNAS接受任何灰度或RGB图像数据集，并根据一系列元启发式方法使用AutoKeras，迁移学习或Swarm Intelligence (SI)方法生成卷积神经网络（CNN）架构。",
