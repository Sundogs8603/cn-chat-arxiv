To overcome these limitations, we use latent diffusion models to generate deformation fields, which transform a general population atlas into one representing a specific sub-population.

    "translated_abstract": "解剖图谱广泛应用于人口分析。有条件的图谱针对通过特定条件（如人口统计学或病理学）定义的特定子人口，并允许研究与年龄相关的形态学差异等细粒度解剖学差异。现有方法使用基于配准的方法或生成模型，前者无法处理大的解剖学变异，后者可能在训练过程中出现不稳定和幻觉。为了克服这些限制，我们使用潜在扩散模型生成形变场，将一个常规人口图谱转变为代表特定子人口的图谱。通过生成形变场，并将有条件的图谱注册到一组图像附近，我们确保结构的合理性，避免直接图像合成时可能出现的幻觉。我们将我们的方法与几种最先进的方法进行了比较。",
