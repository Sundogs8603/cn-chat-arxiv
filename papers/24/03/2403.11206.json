    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.11206v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Encrypted network traffic Classification tackles the problem from different approaches and with different goals. One of the common approaches is using Machine learning or Deep Learning-based solutions on a fixed number of classes, leading to misclassification when an unknown class is given as input. One of the solutions for handling unknown classes is to retrain the model, however, retraining models every time they become obsolete is both resource and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a growing need to allow classification models to detect and adapt to new classes dynamically, without retraining, but instead able to detect new classes using few shots learning [1]. In this paper, we introduce Adaptive Classification By Retrieval CBR, a novel approach for encrypted network traffic classification. Our new approach is based on an ANN-based method, which allows us to effectively identify new and existing classes without retraining the model",

    "translated_abstract": "加密网络流量分类从不同的角度和不同的目标解决问题。其中一个常见的方法是使用基于机器学习或深度学习的解决方案来处理固定数量的类别，导致当输入一个未知类别时发生错误分类。处理未知类别的一个解决方案是重新训练模型，但每次模型变得过时都重新训练既耗费资源又耗时。因此，迫切需要让分类模型能够动态地检测和适应新类别，而无需重新训练，而是能够使用少量样本学习来检测新类别。在本文中，我们介绍了一种新颖的基于检索的自适应分类方法CBR，用于加密网络流量分类。我们的新方法基于基于人工神经网络的方法，可以有效地识别新的和现有的类别，而无需重新训练模型。",
