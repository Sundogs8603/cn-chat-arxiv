    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现在人工智能领域标志着一个重大里程碑，它们的能力常常可以匹敌甚至超越人类在各个领域的专业知识。在这些成就中，它们在翻译任务中的灵活性突出，密切模仿人类翻译者进行的复杂和初步流程，以确保翻译内容的忠实性和质量。尽管在利用LLMs跨不同语言翻译编程代码方面取得了进展，但智能合约翻译领域，特别是进入LLM之前未曾遇到过的语言，仍然是一个未被充分探讨的领域。在我们的研究中，我们提出了一种开创性方法SolMover，它在一个统一的框架内充分利用了两种不同的LLMs的协同作用。这个框架旨在理解编码原则，并将这种理解应用于将代码翻译为一个陌生的语言。",
