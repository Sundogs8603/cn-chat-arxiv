    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个统一的框架，用于在一般的时间非齐次短期利率扩散过程下定价债券。涵盖了债券、债券期权、可赎回/可买入债券和可转换债券(CBs)的定价。通过连续时间马尔可夫链 (CTMC) 近似，我们获得了用于在一般一维短期利率过程下近似计算债券和债券期权价格的闭式矩阵表达式。还开发了一种简单且高效的算法来定价可赎回/可买入债务。零息债券价格的闭式表达式的可用性允许将近似模型完美拟合到当前市场利率期限结构，无论所选的基础扩散过程的复杂性如何。我们进一步考虑了在一般的双向时间非齐次扩散过程下对可转换债券（CBs）的定价，以建模股票和短期利率动力学。也考虑了信用风险。",
