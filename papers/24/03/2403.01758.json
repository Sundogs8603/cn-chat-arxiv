    "translated_abstract": "现有的功能连接（FC）的解释结果通常是通过使用分类结果标签和诸如Pearson相关性或梯度反推等相关分析方法生成的。然而，诊断模型仍然是在黑盒模型上训练的，在训练过程中可能缺乏对重要区域FC的关注。为了增强可解释性和提高诊断性能，在诊断模型中提供关于神经退行性相关区域的先验知识，特别是当健康受试者（HC）发展为主观认知衰退（SCD）和轻度认知障碍（MCI）时，这是一个关键步骤。为了更好地确定神经退行性相关区域，我们采用反事实推理来生成源标签FC派生的目标标签FC矩阵，然后将源标签FC减去目标标签FC。自适应前向和后向转换构成了反事实推理架构。",
