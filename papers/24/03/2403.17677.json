    "translated_abstract": "深度学习方法在航天器上对高光谱图像进行压缩传统上是困难的，因为需要大量的计算复杂性来实现足够的表示能力，以及缺乏用于训练和测试的合适数据集。本文摆脱了传统的自编码器方法，设计了一种名为LineRWKV的预测神经网络，通过逐行递归工作以限制内存消耗。为了实现这一目标，我们采用了一种将Transformer的表示优势与递归神经网络的线性复杂度和递归实现相结合的新型混合注意力-递归操作。压缩算法使用LineRWKV对每个像素进行预测，然后对残差进行熵编码。在HySpecNet-11k数据集和PRISMA图像上的实验结果表明，LineRWKV是第一个在性能上表现优异的深度学习方法。",
