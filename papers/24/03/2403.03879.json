    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.03879v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Bladder cancer ranks within the top 10 most diagnosed cancers worldwide and is among the most expensive cancers to treat due to the high recurrence rates which require lifetime follow-ups. The primary tool for diagnosis is cystoscopy, which heavily relies on doctors' expertise and interpretation. Therefore, annually, numerous cases are either undiagnosed or misdiagnosed and treated as urinary infections. To address this, we suggest a deep learning approach for bladder cancer detection and segmentation which combines CNNs with a lightweight positional-encoding-free transformer and dual attention gates that fuse self and spatial attention for feature enhancement. The architecture suggested in this paper is efficient making it suitable for medical scenarios that require real time inference. Experiments have proven that this model addresses the critical need for a balance between computational efficiency and diagnostic accuracy in cystosco",

    "translated_abstract": "膀胱癌在全球最常诊断的癌症中排名前十，并且由于高复发率，治疗成本高昂，需要终身随访。诊断的主要工具是膀胱镜检查，严重依赖医生的专业知识和解释。因此，每年都有大量病例要么未被诊断，要么被误诊为尿路感染。为了解决这一问题，我们提出了一种深度学习方法，结合了CNN和轻量级的无位置编码变压器以及融合自注意力和空间注意力进行特征增强的双重注意力门机制，用于膀胱癌检测和分割。本文提出的架构高效，适用于需要实时推理的医疗场景。实验证明，这种模型解决了在膀胱镜检查中计算效率和诊断准确性之间取得平衡的迫切需求。",
