Our method utilizes a comprehensive dataset, which tracked mental health symptoms weekly over ten weeks during the initial COVID-19 wave (April to June 2020) in a diverse cohort of U.S. adults. This period, characterized by a surge in mental health symptoms and conditions, offers a critical context for our analysis. Our focus was to extract and analyze patterns of anxiety and depression through a unique lens of qualitative individual attributes using CoDAP. This model not only predicts patterns of anxiety and depression during the pandemic but also unveils key insights into the interplay of demographic factors, behavioral changes, and social determinants of mental health. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the ",
