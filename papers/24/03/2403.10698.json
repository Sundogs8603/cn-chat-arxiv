    "translated_abstract": "正确分类脑部肿瘤对及时和准确治疗患者至关重要。虽然已经有几种基于经典图像处理或深度学习方法的分类算法被提出来快速分类MR图像中的肿瘤，但大多数假定了训练数据是无噪声的不切实际情况。在这项工作中，我们研究了在噪声的MR图像上训练深度学习模型以分类脑部肿瘤的困难但现实的设置。我们提出了两种稳健于噪声MRI训练数据的训练方法，即基于影响力的样本重新加权（ISR）和基于影响力的样本扰动（ISP），这两种方法都基于鲁棒统计中的影响函数。在ISR中，我们根据训练过程中样本对训练的帮助/危害程度自适应地重新加权训练样本，而在ISP中，我们根据影响得分量身定制并注入有帮助的扰动。ISR和ISP均可以提高模型的鲁棒性。",
