The Uniswap Protocol is the largest decentralized application on Ethereum by both gas and blockspace used, and user behaviors of the protocol are very sensitive to fluctuations in gas prices and market structure due to the economic factors of the Protocol. We focus on the chains where Uniswap v3 has the most activity, giving us the best comparison to Ethereum mainnet. Because of cheaper gas and lower block times, we find evidence that the majority of swaps get better gas-adjusted execution on these chains, liquidity providers are more capital efficient, and liquidity providers have increased fee returns from more arbitrage. We also present evidence that two second block times may be too long for optimal liquidity provider returns, compared to first come, first served. We argue that many of the current drawbacks with AMMs may be due to ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了更便宜和更快的链对Uniswap v3协议市场结构的影响。Uniswap协议是以太坊上最大的去中心化应用，用户行为对气价和市场结构的波动非常敏感，由于协议的经济因素。我们关注Uniswap v3活动最多的链，以获得与以太坊主网最佳比较。由于更便宜的气价和更短的出块时间，我们发现大多数交换在这些链上可以获得更好的气价调整执行，流动性提供者更具资本效率，并且流动性提供者从更多套利中获得增加的费用回报。我们还提出证据表明，与先到先得相比，两秒出块时间对于最优流动性提供者回报可能太长了。我们认为，当前AMM的许多缺点可能是由于...",
