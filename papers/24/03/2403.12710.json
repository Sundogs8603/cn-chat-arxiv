Existing approaches often suffer from issues arising through obfuscation being applied globally and a lack of interpretability. Global obfuscation hides privacy sensitive regions, but also contextual regions important for action recognition. Lack of interpretability erodes trust in these new technologies. We highlight the limitations of current paradigms and propose a solution: Human selected privacy templates that yield interpretability by design, an obfuscation scheme that selectively hides attributes and also induces temporal consistency, which is important in action recognition. Our approach is architecture agnostic and directly modifies input imagery, while existing approaches generally require architecture training. Our approach offers more flexibility, as no retraining is required, and outperforms alternatives on",

    "translated_abstract": "对于公众图像中被捕捉到的个人隐私的关注，引发了隐私保护动作识别的需求。现有方法通常存在一些问题，其中混淆应用于全局导致隐私敏感区域被隐藏，但也隐藏了动作识别中重要的环境区域，并且缺乏可解释性。我们强调当前范式的局限性，并提出一个解决方案：人类选择的隐私模板，通过设计提供可解释性，一种有选择性地隐藏属性且还导致时间一致性的混淆方案，在动作识别中具有重要性。我们的方法与架构无关，直接修改输入图像，而现有方法通常需要架构训练。我们的方法提供更大的灵活性，因为无需重新训练，并在性能上优于其他方案。",
