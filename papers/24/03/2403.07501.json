Current approaches can automatically identify such methods using binary relevance machine learning approaches.

Based on feedback from users and our observations, the excessive manual steps can often be tedious, error-prone and counter-intuitive.   In this paper, we present Dev-Assist, an IntelliJ IDEA plugin that detects security-relevant methods using a multi-label machine learning approach that considers dependencies among labels.
