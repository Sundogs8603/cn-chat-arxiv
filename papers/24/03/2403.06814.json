    "translated_abstract": "深度脑部刺激(DBS)作为缓解帕金森病(PD)运动症状的有效干预手段。传统的商用DBS设备仅能向大脑基底神经节(BG)区域提供固定频率的周期脉冲，即连续DBS(cDBS)。然而，它们普遍存在能源效率低和副作用（例如言语障碍）等问题。最近的研究集中在自适应DBS(aDBS)上，以解决cDBS的局限性。具体而言，基于强化学习(RL)的方法已经被开发用来调整刺激的频率，以达到既能源效率又能治疗有效的目的。然而，RL方法通常需要大量的训练数据和计算资源，使得将RL策略整合到实时嵌入式系统中变得难以实现，而这是aDBS所需要的。相比之下，上下文多臂老虎机(CMAB)通常会导致更好的结果",
