Understanding their behavior in games is often referred to as game reasoning. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of a fast-developing game-reasoning framework for large games, known as Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO). We first motivate PSRO, provide historical context, and position PSRO within game-reasoning approaches. We then focus on the strategy exploration issue for PSRO, the challenge of assembling an effective strategy portfolio for modeling the underlying game with minimum computational cost. We also survey current research directions for enhancing the efficiency of PSRO, and explore the applications of PSRO across various domains. We conclude by discussing open questions and future research.",

    "translated_abstract": "在博弈论中，游戏指的是理性决策者或玩家之间相互作用的模型，他们通过选择来实现个人目标。了解他们在游戏中的行为通常被称为博弈推理。本调查全面介绍了一种适用于大型游戏的快速发展的博弈推理框架，称为政策空间响应神谕（PSRO）。我们首先激发PSRO的动机，提供历史背景，并将PSRO定位在博弈推理方法中。然后我们关注PSRO的策略探索问题，即如何有效组合策略组合以在模拟潜在游戏时降低计算成本的挑战。我们还调查了目前用于增强PSRO效率的研究方向，并探讨了PSRO在各个领域中的应用。最后，我们讨论了未解决的问题和未来研究方向。",
