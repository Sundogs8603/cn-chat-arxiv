We specifically examine the capabilities of ChatGPT in performing biometric-related tasks, with an emphasis on face recognition, gender detection, and age estimation. Since biometrics are considered as sensitive information, ChatGPT avoids answering direct prompts, and thus we crafted a prompting strategy to bypass its safeguard and evaluate the capabilities for biometrics tasks. Our study reveals that ChatGPT recognizes facial identities and differentiates between two facial images with considerable accuracy. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate remarkable performance in gender detection and reasonable accuracy for the age estimation tasks. Our findings shed light on the promising potentials in the application of LLMs and foundation models for biometrics.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs），如ChatGPT，在生物识别任务中的应用。我们特别检验了ChatGPT在执行生物识别相关任务方面的能力，重点关注面部识别、性别检测和年龄估计。由于生物识别被视为敏感信息，ChatGPT避免回答直接提示，因此我们设计了提示策略来绕过其保护措施，并评估生物识别任务的能力。我们的研究表明，ChatGPT能够以相当高的准确性识别面部身份并在两个面部图像之间区分。此外，实验结果显示在性别检测方面性能显著，并对年龄估计任务有相当准确性能。我们的发现揭示了在生物识别中应用LLMs和基础模型具有广阔的潜力。",
