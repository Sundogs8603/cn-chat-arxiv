In both cases, the design engineers have to choose the trade-offs between safety and other development constraints. In the case of complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) with thousands of specified constraints, this may lead to severe problems and significantly impact the overall criticality of CPS.

    "translated_abstract": "失效模式、影响和重要性分析（FMECA）是大多数国际标准推荐的一种安全分析方法。经典的FMECA通常以手工填写表格或使用安全分析工具的形式进行。在这两种情况下，设计工程师必须在安全性和其他开发约束之间进行权衡。对于具有数千个指定约束条件的复杂网络物理系统（CPS），这可能导致严重问题，显著影响整个CPS的重要性。在本文中，我们提出采用优化技术来自动化在CPS的FMECA之后进行的决策过程。我们描述了一种基于多智能体的优化方法，扩展了经典的FMECA，以提供关于CPS的重要性和开发约束的最优解。",
