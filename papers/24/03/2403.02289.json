    "translated_abstract": "神经网络虽然强大，但通常缺乏可解释性。物理信息神经网络（PINNs）通过将物理定律纳入损失函数来解决这一限制，使其适用于解决常微分方程（ODEs）和偏微分方程（PDEs）。最近引入的PINC框架将PINNs扩展到控制应用，允许对动态系统进行开放式长距离预测和控制。在这项工作中，我们增强了PINC用于模拟高度非线性系统，如气举油井。通过在PINC网络中引入跳跃连接并完善ODE中的某些项，我们在训练过程中实现了更准确的梯度，从而为油井系统的有效建模过程。我们提出的改进版PINC表现出卓越的性能，在油井应用中平均将验证预测误差降低了67％，并显著增强了梯度",
