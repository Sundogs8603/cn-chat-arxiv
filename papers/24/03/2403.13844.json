    "translated_abstract": "脑机接口（BCIs）通常设计为轻量级且实时响应，以为用户提供及时反馈。经典特征工程计算效率高但准确率低，而近期的神经网络（DNNs）提高准确率但计算代价高、延迟大。作为一种有前途的替代选择，基于向量符号体系结构（VSA）的低维度计算（LDC）分类器实现了小模型大小，但准确率高于经典特征工程方法。然而，它的准确率仍落后于现代DNNs，这使得处理复杂的脑信号具有挑战性。为了提高小模型的准确率，知识蒸馏是一种流行的方法。然而，在学生模型在其不断学习阶段时保持教师模型和学生模型之间的恒定蒸馏水平可能并非最佳选择。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种定时知识获取的方法，使学生模型能够在逐步学习阶段改善准确率。",
