    "translated_abstract": "我们对最先进的深度主动学习方法进行了全面评估。令人惊讶的是，在一般情况下，没有单一模型方法能明显优于基于熵的主动学习，甚至有些方法表现不如随机抽样。我们深入探讨了一些被忽视的方面，如起始预算、预算步长和预训练的影响，揭示了它们在取得卓越结果中的重要性。此外，我们将评估扩展到其他任务，探索主动学习与半监督学习、目标检测相结合的有效性。我们的实验提供了有价值的见解和具体建议，为未来的主动学习研究提供了指导。通过揭示当前方法的局限性，了解不同实验设置的影响，我们旨在激发在具有有限注释预算的真实场景中更有效地训练深度学习模型。这项工作有助于推动",
