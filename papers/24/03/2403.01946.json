In this paper, we construct a generative model that explicitly aims to capture symmetries in the data, resulting in a model that learns which symmetries are present in an interpretable way.

    "translated_abstract": "准确捕捉数据的对称变换可以导致具有强大泛化能力的高效模型，尽管涉及对称性的方法通常需要先验知识。最近在直接从数据集中学习这些对称性方面已取得了进展，但其中大部分工作集中在判别设置上。本文构建了一个生成模型，明确旨在捕捉数据中的对称性，从而产生一个以可解释方式学习数据中存在哪些对称性的模型。我们提供了一个简单的算法来有效学习我们的生成模型，并展示了其在仿射和颜色变换下捕捉对称性的能力。将我们的对称模型与现有的生成模型相结合，可以实现更高的边际测试对数似然和对数据稀疏性的稳健性。",
