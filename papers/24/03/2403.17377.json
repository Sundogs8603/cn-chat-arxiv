    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.17377v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that diffusion models are capable of generating high-quality samples, but their quality heavily depends on sampling guidance techniques, such as classifier guidance (CG) and classifier-free guidance (CFG). These techniques are often not applicable in unconditional generation or in various downstream tasks such as image restoration. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling guidance, called Perturbed-Attention Guidance (PAG), which improves diffusion sample quality across both unconditional and conditional settings, achieving this without requiring additional training or the integration of external modules. PAG is designed to progressively enhance the structure of samples throughout the denoising process. It involves generating intermediate samples with degraded structure by substituting selected self-attention maps in diffusion U-Net with an identity matrix, by considering the self-attention mechanisms",

    "translated_abstract": "近期研究表明，扩散模型能够生成高质量样本，但其质量很大程度上依赖于抽样引导技术，比如分类器引导（CG）和无分类器引导（CFG）。这些技术通常在无条件生成或各种下游任务如图像恢复中无法应用。本文提出了一种新颖的抽样引导技术，称为扰动注意力引导（PAG），它改进了扩散样本的质量，不管是在无条件还是有条件的设置中，都能实现这一目标，而不需要额外训练或整合外部模块。PAG 旨在通过整个去噪过程逐步增强样本的结构。它涉及通过用恒等矩阵替换扩散 U-Net 中选择的自注意力映射生成结构降级的中间样本，考虑自注意力机制。",
