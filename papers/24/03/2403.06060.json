In recent times, sentiment analysis has shown a prominent research gap in understanding human sentiment based on the content shared on social media. Although sentiment analysis for commonly spoken languages has advanced significantly, low-resource languages like Arabic continue to get little research due to resource limitations. In this study, we explore sentiment analysis on tweet texts from SemEval-17 and the Arabic Sentiment Tweet dataset. Moreover, We investigated four pretrained language models and proposed two ensemble language models. Our findings include monolingual models exhibiting superior performance and ensemble models outperforming the baseline while the majority voting ensemble outperforms the English language.",

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体的快速发展使我们能够分析用户的观点。最近，情感分析在理解基于社交媒体分享内容的人类情感方面显示出明显的研究空白。尽管常用语言的情感分析已有显著进展，但像阿拉伯语这样的低资源语言由于资源有限仍然很少被研究。在本研究中，我们探讨了来自SemEval-17和阿拉伯情感推文数据集的推文文本的情感分析。此外，我们调查了四个预训练语言模型，并提出了两个集成语言模型。我们的发现包括单语模型表现出优越性能，集成模型胜过基线，而多数投票集成胜过英语语言。",
