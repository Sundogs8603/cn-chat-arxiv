    "translated_abstract": "在各个领域中，表格在传达信息方面起着至关重要的作用，是组织和呈现结构化数据的不可或缺工具。我们提出了一个计划-推理框架，用于回答带有句子背景的表格上的不同类型的用户查询。该框架首先规划上下文中的推理路径，然后将每个步骤分配给基于程序或文本的推理，以达到最终答案。我们根据该框架构建了一个指令调整集TrixtInstruct。我们的数据集涵盖了那些需要结合表格和句子信息来获得规划和推理能力的程序无法解决的查询。我们通过对TrixInstruct上的Llama-2-7B进行微调，提出了ProTrix。我们的实验表明，ProTrix对各种表格任务具有普遍性，并且达到了与GPT-3.5-turbo相当的性能。我们进一步证明ProTrix可以生成准确和忠实的解释来回答复杂的问题。",
