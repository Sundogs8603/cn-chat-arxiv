    "translated_abstract": "由于获取高度准确或抠图注释的困难和劳动密集性，公开可用的高度准确标签数量有限。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了一种DiffuMatting，它继承了扩散的强大生成能力，并赋予了“抠图任何物体”的能力。我们的DiffuMatting可以：1）作为一个具有高准确度注释的任意抠图工厂；2）与社区LoRAs或各种条件控制方法兼容，以实现社区友好的艺术设计和可控生成。具体地，受绿幕抠像的启发，我们旨在教授扩散模型在固定的绿幕画布上绘画。为此，收集了一个大规模的绿幕数据集（Green100K）作为DiffuMatting的训练数据集。其次，提出了一个绿色背景控制损失，以保持画布为纯绿色以进行区分。",
