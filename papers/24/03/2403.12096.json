A richer user history results in more accurate recommendations. However, in real applications, users prefer e-commerce platforms where the item they seek is at the lowest price. In other words, most users shop from multiple e-commerce platforms simultaneously; different parts of the user's shopping history are shared between different e-commerce platforms. Consequently, we assume in this study that any e-commerce platform has a complete record of the user's history but can only access some parts of it. If a recommendation system is able to predict the missing parts first and enrich the user's shopping history properly, it will be possible to recommend the next item more accurately. Our recommendation system leverages user shopping history to improve prediction accuracy. The proposed approach shows significant improvements in both NDCG@10 and",

    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统可以通过分析用户的购物历史提供准确的推荐。更丰富的用户历史会导致更准确的推荐。然而，在实际应用中，用户更倾向于在物品以最低价格的电子商务平台上购物。换句话说，大多数用户同时从多个电子商务平台购物；用户的不同购物历史部分在不同的电子商务平台之间共享。因此，本研究假设任何电子商务平台都拥有用户历史的完整记录，但只能访问其中的一部分。如果推荐系统能够首先预测缺失的部分并适当丰富用户的购物历史，那么将可以更准确地推荐下一个商品。我们的推荐系统利用用户的购物历史来提高预测准确性。所提出的方法在NDCG@10和其他方面都显示出显著改进。",
