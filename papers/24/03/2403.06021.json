Efficiently categorizing user search queries into a similar hierarchical structure is paramount in enhancing user experience on e-commerce platforms as well as news curation and academic research. The significance of this task is amplified when dealing with sensitive query categorization or critical information dissemination, where inaccuracies can lead to considerable negative impacts. The inherent complexity of hierarchical query classification is compounded by two primary challenges: (1) the pronounced class imbalance that skews towards dominant categories, and (2) the inherent brevity and ambiguity of search queries that hinder accurate classification.   To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that leverages hierarchical information through (i) enhanced representation learning that utilizes the contrastive loss",

    "translated_abstract": "电子商务平台通常以层次结构存储和构造产品信息和搜索数据。将用户搜索查询有效分类到类似的层次结构中，在提升电子商务平台用户体验的同时，对于新闻整理和学术研究也至关重要。处理敏感查询分类或关键信息传播时，精确性的重要性得到放大，因为不准确可能带来相当大的负面影响。分层查询分类的固有复杂性受到两个主要挑战的影响：（1）明显的偏向主导类别的类别不平衡性，和（2）搜索查询的固有简洁性和模糊性，阻碍了准确分类。为了解决这些挑战，我们引入了一种新颖的框架，通过（i）增强的表示学习来利用分层信息。",
