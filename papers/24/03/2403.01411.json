Video, as a popular means of information transmission, has become prevalent in people's daily lives. However, most existing MEL methods primarily focus on linking textual and visual mentions or offline videos's mentions to entities in multi-modal knowledge bases, with limited efforts devoted to linking mentions within online video content. In this paper, we propose a task called Online Video Entity Linking OVEL, aiming to establish connections between mentions in online videos and a knowledge base with high accuracy and timeliness. To facilitate the research works of OVEL, we specifically concentrate on live delivery scenarios and construct a live delivery entity linking dataset called LIVE.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，由于在多模态应用中的重要性，多模态实体链接（MEL）在研究界中越来越受到关注。视频作为一种流行的信息传递方式，已经在人们的日常生活中变得普遍。然而，大多数现有的MEL方法主要集中在链接文本和视觉提及，或是离线视频提及到多模态知识库中的实体，而对于链接在线视频内容中的提及投入的努力有限。在本文中，我们提出了一个名为Online Video Entity Linking OVEL 的任务，旨在建立在线视频中提及与知识库之间的连接，并且具有高准确性和及时性。为了促进OVEL的研究工作，我们特别关注实时交付场景，并构建了一个名为LIVE的实时交付实体链接数据集。此外，我们提出了一个评估指标，考虑了时效性和鲁棒性。",
