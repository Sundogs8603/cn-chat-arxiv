Existing discourse emphasizes EV battery costs as being principally responsible for this price differential and widespread adoption is routinely conditioned upon battery costs declining. We scrutinize such reasoning by sourcing data on EV attributes and market conditions between 2011 and 2023. Our findings are fourfold. First, EV prices are influenced principally by the number of amenities, additional features, and dealer-installed accessories sold as standard on an EV, and to a lesser extent, by EV horsepower. Second, EV range is negatively correlated with EV price implying that range anxiety concerns may be less consequential than existing discourse suggests. Third, battery capacity is positively correlated with EV price, due to more capacity being synonymous with the delivery of more horsepower. Collective",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管电动汽车比汽油汽车更环保，但其采用受到较高的采购价格的挑战。现有讨论强调EV电池成本主要导致价格差异，并普遍认为采用取决于电池成本下降。我们通过收集2011年至2023年之间的EV属性和市场条件数据来审查这种推理。我们的研究结果有四个方面。首先，EV价格主要受到标准出售的附加功能、额外功能和经销商安装的配件数量的影响，以及EV马力的影响较小。其次，EV续航里程与EV价格呈负相关，这意味着续航焦虑可能没有现有讨论所暗示的那么重要。第三，电池容量与EV价格呈正相关，因为更大容量意味着提供更多马力。总的来说，",
