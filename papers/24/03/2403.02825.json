    "translated_abstract": "会话数据广泛用于理解电子商务中用户行为。研究人员试图利用会话数据进行不同任务，如购买意向预测、剩余长度预测、推荐等，因为它提供了有关用户动态兴趣的上下文线索。然而，在线购物会话数据在结构上是半结构化和复杂的，既包含有关产品的非结构化文本数据、搜索查询，又包含结构化的用户动作序列。大多数现有工作侧重于利用粗粒度的物品序列执行特定任务，而在很大程度上忽略了文本和用户动作细节中的细粒度信息。在本研究中，我们通过审查用户会话中丰富信息内的各种线索，深入研究深度会话数据理解。具体来说，我们建议对具有丰富的特征的大规模会话数据进行通用用户行为模型（UBM）的预训练。",
