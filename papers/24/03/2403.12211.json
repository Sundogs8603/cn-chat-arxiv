Integrating all modalities offers a holistic view of a patient's condition, while analyzing them longitudinally provides a better understanding of disease progression. However, real-world longitudinal medical records present challenges: 1) patients may lack some or all of the data for a specific timepoint, and 2) certain modalities or views might be absent for all patients during a particular period. In this work, we introduce a unified model for longitudinal multi-modal multi-view (MMMV) prediction with missingness. Our method allows as many timepoints as desired for input, and aims to leverage all available data, regardless of their availability. We conduct extensive experiments on the knee osteoarthritis dataset from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) for pain and Kellgren-Lawrence grade (KLG) prediction at a future timepoint. We d",

    "translated_abstract": "医疗记录通常由不同的模态组成，如图片、文本和表格信息。整合所有模态可以提供患者状况的全面视图，而纵向分析能更好地理解疾病进展。本文介绍了一种用于处理纵向多模态多视图（MMMV）数据缺失的统一模型。我们的方法可以使用任意数量的时间点作为输入，旨在利用所有可用数据，无论其是否完整。我们在骨关节炎倡议（OAI）的膝关节骨关节炎数据集上进行了对疼痛和Kellgren-Lawrence分级（KLG）在未来时间点的预测的广泛实验。",
