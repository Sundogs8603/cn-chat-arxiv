The problem arises when the source and target graphs are of different scales, and it is much cheaper to label the matchable pairs than the dangling entities. To solve the issue, we propose a novel GNN-based dangling detection and entity alignment framework. While the two tasks share the same GNN and are trained together, the detected dangling entities are removed in the alignment. Our framework is featured by a designed entity and relation attention mechanism for selective neighborhood aggregation in representation learning, as well as a positive-unlabeled learning loss for an unbiased estimation of dangling entities. Experimental results have shown that each component of our design contributes to the overall alignment performance",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了具有无标签悬挂案例的实体对齐问题，这意味着源图或目标图中有一些实体在另一方中没有对应实体，并且这些实体保持未标记状态。该问题出现在源图和目标图的规模不同，并且标记可匹配实体的成本远低于悬挂实体的情况下。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的基于GNN的悬挂检测和实体对齐框架。虽然这两个任务共享相同的GNN，并且一起训练，但检测到的悬挂实体在对齐中被移除。我们的框架特点是具有用于选择性邻域聚合的设计实体和关系注意机制，以及用于对悬挂实体进行无偏估计的正样本-无标签学习损失。实验结果表明我们设计的每个组件都对整体对齐性能有贡献",
