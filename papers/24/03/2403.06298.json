Clustered federated learning addresses this challenge by identifying clusters of local datasets that are approximately homogeneous. One recent approach to clustered federated learning is generalized total variation minimization (GTVMin). This approach requires a similarity graph which can be obtained by domain expertise or in a data-driven fashion via graph learning techniques. Under a widely applicable clustering assumption, we derive an upper bound the deviation between GTVMin solutions and their cluster-wise averages.

    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习应用中的一个关键挑战是本地数据集的统计异质性。集群化联邦学习通过识别大致同质的本地数据集群来解决这一挑战。最近的一种集群化联邦学习方法是广义总变差最小化（GTVMin）。该方法需要一个相似性图，可以通过领域专业知识或数据驱动的图学习技术来获得。在一个广泛适用的集群假设下，我们推导了GTVMin解与其按簇平均值之间的偏差的上界。这个界限为我们提供了关于GTVMin在解决联邦学习环境中的统计异质性的有效性和鲁棒性的宝贵见解。",
