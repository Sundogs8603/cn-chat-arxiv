When consumers visit a marketplace's webpage for a specific item, in addition to that item, the marketplace might also display a ranked listing of sponsored items from various third-party sellers. These sellers are charged an advertisement fee if a user purchases any of the sponsored items from this listing. Determining how to rank these sponsored items for each incoming visit is a crucial challenge for online marketplaces, a problem known as sponsored listings ranking (SLR). The major difficulty of SLR lies in balancing the trade-off between maximizing the overall revenue and recommending high-quality and relevant ranked listings.

    "translated_abstract": "赞助列表是许多知名在线市场的主要收入来源之一，如亚马逊、沃尔玛和阿里巴巴。在线市场可能在展示特定商品的网页上除了该商品外，还会展示来自各种第三方卖家的赞助商品的排名列表。针对每次访问确定如何对这些赞助商品进行排名是在线市场的一个关键挑战，这个问题被称为赞助列表排名（SLR）。SLR的主要困难在于平衡最大化整体收入和推荐高质量和相关排名列表之间的权衡。虽然更相关的排名可能导致更多的购买和消费者参与，但市场在制定排名决策时还需要考虑潜在收入。",
