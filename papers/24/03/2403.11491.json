    "translated_abstract": "测试时间适应（TTA）旨在通过根据任何测试样本调整给定模型，以应对训练和测试数据之间的潜在分布偏移。尽管最近的TTA表现出有希望的性能，但我们仍然面临两个关键挑战：1）先前的方法对每个测试样本执行反向传播，导致许多应用程序无法承受的优化成本；2）虽然现有的TTA可以显著改善在分布数据上的测试性能，但它们经常在TTA后在分布数据上遭受严重性能下降（即所谓的遗忘）。为此，我们提出了一种高效的抗遗忘测试时间适应（EATA）方法，该方法开发了一个主动样本选择标准，以识别可靠且非冗余的样本进行在测试时间的熵最小化。为了缓解遗忘，EATA引入了从测试样本中估计的Fisher正则化项，以约束重要的模型参数免于急剧变化。",
