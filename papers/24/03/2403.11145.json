    "translated_abstract": "先前的立场检测研究通常集中在评估单个实例内的立场，从而在有效建模关于同一特定主题的多方讨论方面存在局限性，这在真实社交媒体互动中自然发生。这种限制主要是由于缺乏真实复制真实社交媒体背景的数据集，阻碍了对话立场检测的研究进展。在本文中，我们介绍了一个新的多轮对话立场检测数据集（称为\\textbf{MT-CSD}），涵盖了用于对话立场检测的多个目标。为了从这一具有挑战性的数据集中获取立场，我们提出了一个全局局部注意力网络（\\textbf{GLAN}），以解决对话数据中固有的长距离和短距离依赖性。值得注意的是，即使是GLAN这样的最先进的立场检测方法，在......",
