    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在需要理解隐含指令和应用常识知识的任务中仍然面临挑战。在这种情况下，LLMs可能需要多次尝试才能达到人类水平的表现，可能会导致在实际环境中产生不准确的响应或推理，影响它们的长期一致性和行为。本文介绍了内部时间意识机器（ITCM），一个计算意识结构。我们进一步提出了基于ITCM的Agent（ITCMA），支持在开放世界环境中生成行为和推理。ITCMA通过考虑Agent与环境的互动和推理，增强了LLMs理解隐含指令和应用常识知识的能力。在Alfworld环境中的评估显示，经过训练的ITCMA在已知集上比最先进技术（SOTA）表现提高了9%。即使未经训练的ITCMA也达到了96%的任务完成度。",
