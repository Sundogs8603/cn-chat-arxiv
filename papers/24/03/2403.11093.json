Each type of waiting customer or server joins a separate queue, forming a bipartite graph with customer-side queues and server-side queues. The platform can match the servers and customers if their types are compatible. The matched pairs then leave the system. The platform will charge a customer a price according to their type when they arrive and will pay a server a price according to their type. The arrival rate of each queue is determined by the price according to some unknown demand or supply functions. Our goal is to design pricing and matching algorithms to maximize the profit of the platform with unknown demand and supply functions, while keeping queue lengths of both customers and servers below a predetermined threshold.

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑一个具有多种类型顾客和服务器的动态系统。每种等待的顾客或服务器加入一个单独的队列，形成一个具有顾客队列和服务器队列的二部图。平台可以匹配服务器和顾客，如果它们的类型是兼容的。匹配的对将离开系统。平台将根据顾客的类型收取一个价格，当它们到达时，并根据其类型向服务器支付一个价格。每个队列的到达率取决于某些未知的需求或供应函数按价格确定。我们的目标是设计定价和匹配算法，以最大化平台在未知需求和供应函数下的利润，同时保持顾客和服务器的队列长度低于预定阈值。这个系统可以用来建模像乘车共享市场这样的双边市场，有乘客和司机。挑战在于",
