    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.04280v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work is an attempt to introduce a comprehensive benchmark for Arabic speech recognition, specifically tailored to address the challenges of telephone conversations in Arabic language. Arabic, characterized by its rich dialectal diversity and phonetic complexity, presents a number of unique challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. These challenges are further amplified in the domain of telephone calls, where audio quality, background noise, and conversational speech styles negatively affect recognition accuracy. Our work aims to establish a robust benchmark that not only encompasses the broad spectrum of Arabic dialects but also emulates the real-world conditions of call-based communications. By incorporating diverse dialectical expressions and accounting for the variable quality of call recordings, this benchmark seeks to provide a rigorous testing ground for the development and evaluation of ASR systems capable of",

    "translated_abstract": "这项工作旨在引入一个全面的用于阿拉伯语音识别评估的基准，专门针对阿拉伯语电话对话中的挑战进行了定制。阿拉伯语以其丰富的方言多样性和语音复杂性而闻名，对自动语音识别（ASR）系统提出了许多独特的挑战。这些挑战在电话通话领域进一步放大，那里的音频质量、背景噪音和会话式语音风格会对识别准确性产生负面影响。我们的工作旨在建立一个稳健的基准，不仅包含广泛的阿拉伯方言范围，还模拟呼叫通讯的真实条件。通过结合多样的方言表达，并考虑呼叫录音的可变质量，这个基准旨在为开发和评估能够应对实际挑战的ASR系统提供严格的测试平台。",
