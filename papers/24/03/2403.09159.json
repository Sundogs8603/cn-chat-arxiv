Despite the recent increase in HS content posted online, research on automatic CN generation has been relatively scarce and predominantly focused on English. In this paper, we present CONAN-EUS, a new Basque and Spanish dataset for CN generation developed by means of Machine Translation (MT) and professional post-edition. Being a parallel corpus, also with respect to the original English CONAN, it allows to perform novel research on multilingual and crosslingual automatic generation of CNs. Our experiments on CN generation with mT5, a multilingual encoder-decoder model, show that generation greatly benefits from training on post-edited data, as opposed to relying on silver MT data only. These results are confirmed by their correlation with a qualitative manual evaluation, demonstratin",

    "translated_abstract": "反叙事（CNs）是对仇恨言论（HS）的非负文本回应，旨在化解在线仇恨并减轻其在媒体之间的传播。尽管在线仇恨言论内容最近有所增加，但有关自动生成反叙事的研究相对较少，且主要集中在英语上。在本文中，我们提出了CONAN-EUS，这是一个通过机器翻译（MT）和专业后期编辑开发的用于生成反叙事的巴斯克语和西班牙语数据集。作为平行语料库，与原始英文CONAN相比，它允许进行关于多语言和跨语言自动生成反叙事的新型研究。我们使用mT5进行了CN生成实验，这是一个多语言编码器-解码器模型，结果表明，相较于仅依赖于银标机器翻译数据，通过在后期编辑数据上训练，生成效果大幅提升。这些结果与定性手动评估相互印证。",

Experimental results demonstrate that training on post-edited data greatly improves the quality of counter narrative generation compared to relying solely on machine translated data."
