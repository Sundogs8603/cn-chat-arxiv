Leveraging a taxonomy-guided synthetic data generation process and a multi-phase tuning framework, LAB significantly reduces reliance on expensive human annotations and proprietary models like GPT-4. We demonstrate that LAB-trained models can achieve competitive performance across several benchmarks compared to models trained with traditional human-annotated or GPT-4 generated synthetic data. Thus offering a scalable, cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM capabilities and instruction-following behaviors without the drawbacks of catastrophic forgetting, marking a step forward in the efficient training of LLMs for a wide range of applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "这项工作介绍了LAB（ChatBots的大规模对齐），这是一种旨在克服大型语言模型（LLM）训练中指令调整阶段的可扩展性挑战的创新方法。通过利用基于分类法的合成数据生成过程和多阶段调整框架，LAB显著减少对昂贵的人类注释和诸如GPT-4之类的专有模型的依赖。我们证明，使用LAB训练的模型在几个基准测试中的性能可以与使用传统人类注释或GPT-4生成的合成数据训练的模型相比具有竞争力。因此，在不会出现灾难性遗忘的情况下，提供了一种可扩展、具有成本效益的解决方案，以增强LLM的能力和指令遵循行为，标志着在高效训练各种应用的LLM方面迈出了一步。",
