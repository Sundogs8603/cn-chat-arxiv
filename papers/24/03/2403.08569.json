    "translated_abstract": "物理信息神经网络（PINNs）成功地解决了基于偏微分方程（PDEs）的各种计算物理问题。但是，在处理与奇异性和振荡等不规则性相关的问题时，训练的解通常会出现低精度。此外，大多数当前的工作只为预定输入参数提供训练解决方案。如果输入参数发生任何更改，则需要进行转移学习或重新训练，并且传统的数值技术也需要独立模拟。本文提出了一种基于Galerkin方法和分段多项式节点基础函数的物理驱动GraphSAGE方法（PD-GraphSAGE），用于解决由不规则PDE管控的计算问题并发展参数PDE代理模型。该方法采用物理领域的图表示，从而减少了由于局部细化而产生的评估点的需求。",
