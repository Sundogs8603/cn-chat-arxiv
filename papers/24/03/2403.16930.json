    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习提供了一种隐私保护机制，用于在网络化设备（如移动设备、物联网边缘节点）上对机器学习模型进行分布式训练。它通过在网络上不共享实际数据来实现边缘的人工智能。现有研究通常侧重于非独立同分布数据的通用方面和客户系统特征的异质性，但他们常常忽视模型开发中不足的数据问题，这可能来自边缘节点上不均匀的类别标签分布，以及高度可变的数据容量。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种名为FLIGAN的创新方法来解决联邦学习中数据不完整性的问题。首先，我们利用生成对抗网络（GAN）来敏锐捕捉复杂数据分布，并生成与真实数据紧密相似的合成数据。然后，我们使用合成数据来增强模型的鲁棒性和完整性。",
