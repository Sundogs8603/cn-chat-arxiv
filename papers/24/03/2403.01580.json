    "translated_abstract": "在当前的机器翻译（MT）领域中，Transformer架构尤其在高资源语言对中脱颖而出。本研究探讨了它在包括英语$\\leftrightarrow$爱尔兰语和英语$\\leftrightarrow$马拉地语语言对中低资源语言对中的有效性。研究确定了最佳超参数和子词模型类型，显著改善了Transformer模型在低资源语言对中的翻译质量。针对低资源语言的平行数据集的稀缺性可能阻碍MT的发展。为解决这一问题，开发了gaHealth，这是爱尔兰语健康数据的第一个双语语料库。使用这一领域特定数据集开发的模型，在与LoResMT2021共享任务模型相比时，在BLEU评分上表现出非常显著的改进。随后的人类评估使用多维度评估指标进行。",
