    "translated_abstract": "arXiv：2403.04278v1 发表类型：新摘要：传统的顺序推荐方法假设用户的序列数据足够干净，可以学习准确的序列表示以反映用户偏好。然而，在实践中，用户的序列不可避免地包含噪声（例如，偶然的交互），导致对用户偏好的不正确反映。因此，一些先驱性研究探讨了建模序列性和序列之间关联性以隐式或显式地减少噪声的影响。然而，仅依赖于序列内信息（即，序列内的顺序性和关联性）是不足的，可能会导致过度去噪和欠去噪问题（OUPs），尤其是对于短序列。为了提高可靠性，我们建议在去噪之前通过插入项来增强序列。然而，由于数据稀疏问题和计算成本，选择整个项目世界中的适当项目插入适当位置是具有挑战性的。",
