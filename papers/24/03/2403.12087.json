Choosing a film that appeals to the emotional inclinations of a varied group can be tricky. One of the most difficult aspects of making group movie suggestions is achieving agreement among members. At the same time, emotion is the most important component that connects the film and the viewer. Current research proposes a methodology for group movie selection that employs emotional analysis from numerous sources, such as film posters, soundtracks, and text. Our research stands at the intersection of emotion recognition technology in music, text, color images, and group decision-making, providing a practical tool for navigating the complex dynamics of film selection in a group setting. The survey participants were given emotion categories and asked to select the emotions that best suited a particular movie. Preliminary comparison results between real and predicte",
