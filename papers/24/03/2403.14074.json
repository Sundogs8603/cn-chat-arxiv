    "translated_abstract": "在最近的研究中，对比学习已被证明是一种非常有效的表示学习方法，广泛用于密集检索。然而，我们发现仅依赖对比学习可能会导致次优的检索性能。另一方面，尽管许多检索数据集支持各种超越对比学习的学习目标，但在多任务学习场景中高效地组合它们可能具有挑战性。在本文中，我们介绍了M3，这是一个先进的递归多跳密集句子检索系统，它建立在一种新颖的多任务混合目标方法之上，用于密集文本表示学习，解决了上述挑战。我们的方法在大规模开放领域事实验证基准数据集FEVER上取得了最先进的性能。代码和数据可在以下链接获取: https://github.com/TonyBY/M3",
