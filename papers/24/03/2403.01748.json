    "translated_abstract": "从脑动态解码语言是脑机接口（BCI）领域中一个重要的开放方向，尤其考虑到大型语言模型的快速增长。相对于需要电极植入手术的侵入性信号，非侵入性神经信号（如EEG、MEG）由于其安全性和普适性而越来越受到关注。然而，在三个方面的探索还不足：1）以前的方法主要集中在EEG上，但没有一个先前的研究解决了MEG信号质量更好的问题；2）以前的工作主要在生成解码过程中使用“teacher-forcing”，这是不切实际的；3）以前的工作大多是基于“BART”而不是完全自回归的，而在其他序列任务中表现更好。在本文中，我们探讨了MEG信号的脑到文本转换在语音解码形式中。我们是第一个在交叉注意力中研究的。",
