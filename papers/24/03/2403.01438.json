Smart meter data availability has led to the demand for sensor-based load forecasting. Conventional ML allows training a single global model using data from multiple smart meters requiring data transfer to a central server, raising concerns for network requirements, privacy, and security. We propose a split learning-based framework for load forecasting to alleviate this issue. We split a deep neural network model into two parts, one for each Grid Station (GS) responsible for an entire neighbourhood's smart meters and the other for the Service Provider (SP). Instead of sharing their data, client smart meters use their respective GSs' model split for forward pass and only share their activations with the GS. Under this framework, each GS is responsible for training a personalized model split for their respective neighbourhoods,",

    "translated_abstract": "准确的负荷预测对能源管理、基础设施规划和供需平衡至关重要。智能电表数据的可用性导致了传感器数据驱动的负荷预测需求。传统机器学习允许使用来自多个智能电表的数据训练单个全局模型，这需要将数据传输到中央服务器，引发了对网络要求、隐私和安全性的担忧。我们提出了一种基于分裂学习的负荷预测框架，以缓解这一问题。我们将深度神经网络模型分为两个部分，一个用于每个Grid Station（GS），负责一个整个社区的智能电表；另一个用于服务提供商（SP）。客户智能电表不共享其数据，而是使用各自的GS模型拆分进行前向传递，只将其激活与GS共享。在这一框架下，每个GS负责为其各自的社区训练个性化模型分裂。",
