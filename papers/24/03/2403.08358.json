    "translated_abstract": "日志分析和监控是软件维护中至关重要的方面，也是识别缺陷的关键。特别是，日志数据的时间性质和庞大规模引发了一个有趣且重要的研究问题：如何对日志进行总结和随时间监控？尽管这在软件工程领域是一个基础性研究课题，但现有的工作通常集中在启发式、语法或基于静态方法。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种在线基于语义的聚类方法，用于动态更新日志聚类，以实现监控代码错误的生命周期。我们还引入了一种新颖的度量标准来评估时间日志聚类的性能。我们使用工业数据集测试了我们的系统和评估度量标准，发现我们的解决方案优于类似系统。我们希望我们的工作能够鼓励在缺陷数据集中进行更深入的时间性探索。",
