Our investigation focused on the effectiveness of four tokenizers across various tasks, including News Classification, Hate Speech Detection, Sentiment Analysis, and Natural Language Inference. Leveraging a diverse set of vocabulary sizes, we scrutinize the intricate interplay between tokenization approaches and model performance. The results reveal that Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) with Farasa outperforms other strategies in multiple tasks, underscoring the significance of morphological analysis in capturing the nuances of the Arabic language.

    "translated_abstract": "本文全面研究了令牌化策略和词汇量对阿拉伯语言模型在下游自然语言处理任务中性能的影响。我们的研究重点关注了四种令牌化器在各种任务中的有效性，包括新闻分类、仇恨言论检测、情感分析和自然语言推理。利用多样化的词汇量，我们仔细研究了令牌化方法与模型性能之间的复杂相互作用。结果表明，使用Farasa的字节对编码（BPE）在多个任务中优于其他策略，强调了在捕捉阿拉伯语言细微差异方面形态分析的重要性。然而，在情感分析中存在挑战，方言特定的分割问题影响了模型的效率。计算效率分析表明，BPE与Farasa的稳定性较高。",
