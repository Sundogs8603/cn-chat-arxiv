This paradigm decouples the training process into separate representation learning and classifier re-training.

In this study, we revisit classifier re-training methods based on a unified feature representation and re-evaluate their performances.

    "translated_abstract": "在长尾识别领域，解耦训练范式在各种方法中展示了显著的能力。该范式将训练过程分解为独立的表示学习和分类器重训练。先前的工作尝试同时改进两个阶段，这使得难以分离分类器重训练的影响。此外，最近的实证研究显示，简单的正则化可以产生强大的特征表示，强调了有必要重新评估现有的分类器重训练方法。在本研究中，我们重新审视基于统一特征表示的分类器重训练方法，并重新评估它们的性能。我们提出了一种称为Logits Magnitude的新度量作为模型性能的优越衡量标准，取代常用的Weight Norm。然而，由于在训练过程中直接优化新度量很难，我们引入了一种适当的方法。",
