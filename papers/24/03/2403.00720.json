In this paper, we present a new analysis of the existence and uniqueness of fixed points for implicit-depth neural networks based on the concept of subhomogeneous operators and the nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory. Compared to previous similar analyses, our theory allows for weaker assumptions on the parameter matrices, thus yielding a more flexible framework for well-defined implicit networks. We illustrate the performance of the resulting subhomogeneous networks on feed-forward, convolutional, and graph neural network examples.",

    "translated_abstract": "隐式深度神经网络近年来在各种应用中作为传统网络的强大替代方案而发展壮大。然而，这些模型通常缺乏存在性和唯一性保证，引发稳定性、性能和可复现性问题。本文基于子齐次算子和非线性Perron-Frobenius理论，提出了一种用于隐式深度神经网络的固定点存在性和唯一性的新分析。与先前类似分析相比，我们的理论允许对参数矩阵提出更弱的假设，从而为定义良好的隐式网络提供更灵活的框架。我们在前馈、卷积和图神经网络示例上展示了由此产生的子齐次网络的性能。",
