Moreover, obtaining plenty of human annotations for initiative labels can be expensive. To address this issue, we propose a general mix-Initiative Dynamic Prefix Tuning framework (IDPT) to decouple different initiatives from the generation model, which learns initiative-aware prefixes in both supervised and unsupervised settings.

    "translated_abstract": "混合倡议在控制对话方向中起着关键作用。对于发言者， passively 响应或 proactively 主导会导致完全不同的响应。然而，大多数对话系统专注于训练一个统一的响应生成模型，而不区分不同的倡议。这导致了交叉污染问题，模型混淆了不同的倡议并生成不合适的响应。此外，为倡议标签获取大量人类注释可能很昂贵。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个通用的混合倡议动态前缀调整框架 (IDPT)，以解耦不同倡议与生成模型，该模型在监督和非监督设置下学习倡议感知前缀。具体来说，IDPT将倡议因素解耦为不同的前缀参数，并使用注意机制调整倡议的选择。",
