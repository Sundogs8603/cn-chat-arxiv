    "translated_abstract": "甘蔗作为世界糖业的关键作物，容易受多种病害侵害，这些病害对其产量和质量都有重大负面影响。为了有效管理和实施预防措施，必须及时准确地检测病害。本研究提出了一种名为SugarcaneNet2024的独特模型，通过叶片图像处理，能够优于先前方法自动快速检测甘蔗病害。我们提出的模型汇总了七个定制的、经过LASSO正则化的预训练模型的优化加权平均集成，特别是InceptionV3、InceptionResNetV2、DenseNet201、DenseNet169、Xception和ResNet152V2。最初，我们在这些预训练模型底部添加了三层更密集层，具有0.0001的LASSO正则化，三个30%的dropout层和三个启用renorm的批量归一化，以提高性能。",
