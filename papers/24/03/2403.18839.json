    "translated_abstract": "本研究深入分析了通过Richard D. Wyckoff在20世纪早期设计的Wyckoff阶段框架的金融市场。重点关注Wyckoff框架中的累积模式，研究探讨了交易范围和次级测试阶段，阐明了它们在理解市场动态和识别潜在交易机会中的重要性。通过剖析这些阶段的复杂性，本研究揭示了市场结构通过创造流动性，为交易者如何利用这些知识来预测价格走势和做出明智决策提供了见解。有效检测和分析Wyckoff模式需要能够处理复杂市场数据的强大计算模型，其中空间数据最好通过卷积神经网络(CNN)进行分析，而时间数据则通过长短期记忆（LSTM）模型进行分析。",
