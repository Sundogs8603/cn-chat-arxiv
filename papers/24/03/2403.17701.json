    "translated_abstract": "图像分割在医疗领域的诊断和治疗中占据重要位置。传统的卷积神经网络（CNN）和Transformer模型在这一领域取得了重大进展，但仍然面临由于有限感受野或高计算复杂性而带来的挑战。最近，状态空间模型（SSM），特别是Mamba及其变体，在视觉领域表现出显著性能。然而，它们的特征提取方法可能不够有效，保留了一些冗余结构，留下了参数减少的空间。受先前的空间和通道注意方法的启发，我们提出了Triplet Mamba-UNet。该方法利用残余VSS块来提取密集的上下文特征，同时利用Triplet SSM来融合空间和通道维度上的特征。我们在ISIC17、ISIC18、CVC-300、CVC-ClinicDB上进行了实验。",
