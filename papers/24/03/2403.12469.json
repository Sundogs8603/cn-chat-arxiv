Prior work has addressed this challenge by developing a series of methods that provide richer $contexts$, e.g., sentiment or cultural nuances, to models. While shown to be effective individually, no study has systematically evaluated their collective effectiveness. As a result, it remains unclear to what extent additional contexts can improve sarcasm recognition. In this work, we explore the improvements that existing methods bring by incorporating more contexts into a model. To this end, we develop a framework where we can integrate multiple contextual cues and test different approaches. In evaluation with four approaches on three sarcasm recognition benchmarks, we achieve existing state-of-the-art performances and also demonstrate the benefits of sequentially adding more co",

    "translated_abstract": "讽刺识别具有挑战性，因为它需要理解文本的真实意图，这与字面意义相反或不同。先前的研究通过开发一系列提供更丰富$contexts$（例如情感或文化细微差别）给模型的方法来解决这一挑战。虽然已经单独证明了这些方法的有效性，但没有研究系统地评估它们的集体效果。因此，额外背景信息能够提高对讽刺的识别程度仍然不清楚。本文探讨了集成现有方法所带来的改进，通过将更多背景信息整合到模型中。为此，我们制定了一个框架，可以集成多个上下文线索并测试不同方法。在对三个讽刺识别基准测试的四种方法进行评估时，我们实现了现有的最先进性能，并演示了逐步添加更多co有益之处。",
