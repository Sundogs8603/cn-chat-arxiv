Active inference, regarded as a general theory of behaviour, offers a principled approach to probing the basis of sophistication in planning and decision-making. In this paper, we examine two decision-making schemes in active inference based on 'planning' and 'learning from experience'. Furthermore, we also introduce a mixed model that navigates the data-complexity trade-off between these strategies, leveraging the strengths of both to facilitate balanced decision-making. We evaluate our proposed model in a challenging grid-world scenario that requires adaptability from the agent. Additionally, our model provides the opportunity to analyze the evolution of various parameters, offering valuable insights and contributing to an explainable framework for intelligent decision-making.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能的快速发展，理解智能行为的基础变得越来越重要。作为一种行为的通用理论，主动推断提供了一种原则性的方法来探究规划和决策制定中的复杂性基础。本文研究了主动推断中基于“规划”和“从经验中学习”两种决策方案。此外，我们还介绍了一个混合模型，以在这些策略之间平衡数据复杂性与协作，利用两者的优势促进平衡决策制定。我们在一个需要代理适应性的具有挑战性的网格世界情景中评估了我们提出的模型。此外，我们的模型提供了分析各种参数演变的机会，提供宝贵的见解，并为智能决策制定提供了一个可解释的框架。",
