    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.05770v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) asks an agent to follow a given language instruction to navigate through a real 3D environment. Despite significant advances, conventional VLN agents are trained typically under disturbance-free environments and may easily fail in real-world scenarios, since they are unaware of how to deal with various possible disturbances, such as sudden obstacles or human interruptions, which widely exist and may usually cause an unexpected route deviation. In this paper, we present a model-agnostic training paradigm, called Progressive Perturbation-aware Contrastive Learning (PROPER) to enhance the generalization ability of existing VLN agents, by requiring them to learn towards deviation-robust navigation. Specifically, a simple yet effective path perturbation scheme is introduced to implement the route deviation, with which the agent is required to still navigate successfully following the original instruction",

    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.05770v1 发表类型: 跨领域 摘要: 视觉与语言导航（VLN）要求智能体根据给定的语言指令在真实的三维环境中导航。尽管取得了显著进展，传统的VLN智能体通常在无干扰的环境下进行训练，可能会在现实世界中轻易失败，因为它们不知道如何处理各种可能的干扰，例如突然的障碍物或人类中断，这些干扰广泛存在并通常会导致意外的路径偏移。本文提出了一种名为渐进扰动感知对比学习（PROPER）的模型无关训练范式，以增强现有VLN智能体的泛化能力，要求它们朝向具有偏离鲁棒性导航的学习。具体来说，引入了一种简单而有效的路径扰动方案来实现路线偏离，智能体需要继续成功地按照原始指令进行导航。",
