This discrimination can range from subtle sexist remarks and gendered stereotypes to outright hate speech. Prior research has revealed that ignoring online abuse not only affects the individuals targeted but also has broader societal implications. These consequences extend to the discouragement of women's engagement and visibility within public spheres, thereby reinforcing gender inequality. This thesis investigates the nuances of how gender bias is expressed through language and within language technologies. Significantly, this thesis expands research on gender bias to multilingual contexts, emphasising the importance of a multilingual and multicultural perspective in understanding societal biases.

    "translated_abstract": "性别偏见代表着一种针对个体基于其性别的系统性负面对待。这种歧视可以从微妙的性别主义言论和性别刻板印象，到直接的仇恨言论。先前的研究已经揭示，忽视在线虐待不仅会影响受害个体，还会对更广泛的社会产生影响。这些后果延伸至阻挠妇女参与和在公共领域中的可见度，从而强化性别不平等。本论文探讨了性别偏见如何通过语言及语言技术表达的细微差别。特别是，本论文将研究扩展到多语言背景下的性别偏见，强调了从多语言和多文化视角理解社会偏见的重要性。在本论文中，我采取了跨领域的方法，将自然语言处理与政治学等其他学科联系起来。",
