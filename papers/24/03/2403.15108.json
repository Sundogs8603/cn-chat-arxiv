The presented Wasserstein active regression model is based on the principles of distribution-matching to measure the representativeness of the labeled dataset. The Wasserstein distance is computed using GroupSort Neural Networks. The use of such networks provides theoretical foundations giving a way to quantify errors with explicit bounds for their size and depth. This solution is combined with another uncertainty-based approach that is more outlier-tolerant to complete the query strategy. Finally, this method is compared with other classical and recent solutions. The study empirically shows the pertinence of such a representativity-uncertainty approach, which provides good estimation all along the query procedure. Moreover, the Wasserstein active regression often achieves more precise estimations and tends to improve accuracy faster than other models.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种新的用于回归问题的主动学习策略。所提出的Wasserstein主动回归模型基于分布匹配原则，用于衡量标记数据集的代表性。使用GroupSort神经网络计算Wasserstein距离。这些网络的使用提供了理论基础，可以量化错误并明确其大小和深度。此解决方案结合了另一种基于不确定性的方法，对异常值更具容忍性，以完成查询策略。最后，该方法与其他经典和最近的解决方案进行了比较。研究实验性地展示了这种代表性-不确定性方法的相关性，该方法在整个查询过程中提供了良好的估计。此外，Wasserstein主动回归通常能够实现更精确的估计，并且往往比其他模型更快提高准确性。",
