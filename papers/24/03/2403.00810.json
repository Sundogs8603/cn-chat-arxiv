On the other hand cognitive architectures have excellent interpretability and are flexible to update but require a lot of manual work to instantiate. In this work, we combine the best of both worlds: bootstrapping a cognitive-based model with the noisy knowledge encoded in large language models. Through an embodied agent doing kitchen tasks, we show that our proposed framework yields better efficiency compared to an agent based entirely on large language models. Our experiments indicate that large language models are a good source of information for cognitive architectures, and the cognitive architecture in turn can verify and update the knowledge of large language models to a specific domain.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型包含世界的杂乱一般知识，但很难进行训练或微调。另一方面，认知架构具有出色的可解释性和更新的灵活性，但需要大量手动工作来实例化。在这项工作中，我们结合了两个世界的优势：用大型语言模型编码的杂乱知识引导认知模型。通过一个做厨房任务的具身Agent，我们展示了我们提出的框架相比完全基于大型语言模型的Agent具有更好的效率。我们的实验表明，大型语言模型是认知架构的信息来源，而认知架构反过来可以验证并更新大型语言模型对特定领域的知识。",
    "tldr": "通过利用大型语言模型中的知识，我们将认知模型与大语言模型相结合，提出了一种通过具身Agent完成任务的框架，相较于完全基于大语言模型的Agent，具有更好的效率。",
