    "translated_abstract": "时空（ST）预测对于在城市基于位置的应用中做出明智决策（如顺风车）至关重要。然而，现有的ST模型通常需要区域划分作为先决条件，导致两个主要缺点。首先，基于位置的服务需要为不同目的而定义临时区域，需要支持成本高昂的多个具有不同规模和区域的ST模型。其次，不同的ST模型可能产生冲突的输出，导致混乱的预测。 本文提出了One4All-ST框架，可以仅使用一个模型来为任意可修改的区域单元进行ST预测。为了减少获取多尺度预测的成本，我们设计了具有分层空间建模和规模归一化模块的ST网络，以有效且平等地学习多尺度表示。为了解决跨尺度的预测不一致性，我们提出了一种动态规划sch",
