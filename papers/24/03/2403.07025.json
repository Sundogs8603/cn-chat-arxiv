    "translated_abstract": "在新兴的量子计算领域中，变分量子本征求解器（VQE）作为一种有希望解决复杂量子问题的算法在嘈杂的中等规模量子（NISQ）时代尤为突出。然而，量子设备中普遍存在的噪声经常限制了VQE结果的准确性和可靠性。本研究通过利用神经网络在VQE计算中进行零噪声外推（ZNE）来改善这一挑战。通过使用Qiskit框架，我们使用RY-RZ参数化量子电路，并检查它们在不同级别的去极化噪声下的行为。我们的研究涵盖了在不同噪声强度下确定Hamiltonian（定义为Z算子的张量积）的期望值，以提取基态能量。为了将观察到的噪声下的结果与理想的无噪声情况连接起来",
