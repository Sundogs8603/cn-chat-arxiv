    "translated_abstract": "许多计算机视觉和机器学习问题被建模为在异构图上的学习任务，具有来自不同类型节点和边的各种关系。异构图神经网络(HGNNs)是一种为异构图设计的有前途的神经模型类。现有HGNNs建立在传统GNNs基础上，利用不同的参数空间来建模不同的关系。然而，现有HGNNs的实际有效性通常局限于简单的异构图，具有少量关系类型。本文首先突出和证明现有HGNNs使用的标准方法不可避免地导致参数爆炸和关系坍塌，使得HGNNs对具有大量关系类型的复杂异构图 less有效或不实用。为了克服这一问题，我们引入了一种新颖的框架，Blend&Grind-HGNN (BG-HGNN)，通过仔细处理挑战来有效应对这些问题。",
