    "translated_abstract": "解释异常值的出现以及其产生机制在各种领域中可能非常重要。故障、欺诈、威胁等问题，除了被正确识别之外，通常需要有效的解释以有效执行可操作的对抗措施。越来越广泛地使用复杂的机器学习方法来识别异常值，使得这样的解释更具挑战性。我们提出了决策树异常值回归器（DTOR），这是一种通过估计异常检测模型生成的异常分数来为单个数据点生成基于规则的解释的技术。这是通过首先应用决策树回归器来计算估计分数，然后提取与数据点分数相关联的相对路径来实现的。我们的结果表明，即使在具有大量特征的数据集中，DTOR的鲁棒性也得到了证实。此外，与其他基于规则的方法相比",
