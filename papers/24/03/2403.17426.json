    "title": "Knowledge-Powered Recommendation for an Improved Diet Water Footprint",
    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.17426v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: According to WWF, 1.1 billion people lack access to water, and 2.7 billion experience water scarcity at least one month a year. By 2025, two-thirds of the world's population may be facing water shortages. This highlights the urgency of managing water usage efficiently, especially in water-intensive sectors like food. This paper proposes a recommendation engine, powered by knowledge graphs, aiming to facilitate sustainable and healthy food consumption. The engine recommends ingredient substitutes in user recipes that improve nutritional value and reduce environmental impact, particularly water footprint. The system architecture includes source identification, information extraction, schema alignment, knowledge graph construction, and user interface development. The research offers a promising tool for promoting healthier eating habits and contributing to water conservation efforts.",

    "translated_abstract": "根据世界自然基金会（WWF）的数据，有11亿人缺乏水资源，27亿人每年至少有一个月经历水资源匮乏。到2025年，全球三分之二的人口可能面临水资源短缺。这突显了高效管理水资源使用的紧迫性，尤其是在食品等耗水行业。本文提出了一个基于知识图谱的推荐系统，旨在促进可持续和健康的食品消费。该系统在用户食谱中推荐成分替代品，从而改善营养价值并减少环境影响，特别是水足迹。系统架构包括源识别、信息提取、模式对齐、知识图谱构建和用户界面开发。这项研究为推广更健康的饮食习惯和促进节水工作提供了一种具有前景的工具。",
