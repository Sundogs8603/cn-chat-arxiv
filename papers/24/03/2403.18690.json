    "translated_abstract": "Annolid是一个基于深度学习的软件包，旨在对视频文件中的研究目标进行分割、标记和跟踪，主要集中在动物行为分析上。基于最先进的实例分割方法，Annolid现在利用Cutie视频对象分割模型实现从单个注释帧中实现多个动物的弹性、无标记跟踪，即使它们可能部分或完全被环境特征或彼此遮挡。我们还整合了“Segment Anything”和“Grounding-DINO”策略，通过文本命令自动遮罩和分割可识别的动物和物体，消除了手动注释的需要。Annolid的综合对象分割方法灵活适应广泛的行为分析应用，能够对不同的行为状态进行分类，如“freezing”。",
