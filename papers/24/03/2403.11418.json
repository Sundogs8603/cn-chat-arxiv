    "translated_abstract": "一个确定性的时间过程可以通过其轨迹来确定，该轨迹是(a)初始条件$z_0 \\in \\mathcal{Z}$和(b)过渡函数$f:(\\mathcal{Z}, \\mathcal{T}) \\to \\mathcal{Z}$的乘积空间中的元素，往往受底层动力系统控制的影响。现有方法通常将过渡函数建模为微分方程或循环神经网络。尽管它们在预测未来测量方面很有效，但很少有结果成功建立使用神经网络进行轨迹采样和统计推断的方法，部分原因是参数化方面的约束。在这项工作中，我们引入了一种机制，通过将过渡函数$f$显式地参数化为函数空间中的一个元素来学习轨迹的分布。我们的框架允许有效地合成新颖的轨迹，同时还直接提供了一个方便的工具来进行推断。",
