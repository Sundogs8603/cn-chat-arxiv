    "translated_abstract": "最近，解决大型语言模型（LLMs）中的幻觉的努力主要集中在属性文本生成上，这种方法通过引用支持源在生成的文本中加入支持文本以进行事后事实核查和更正。然而，这些引用通常指向整个文档或段落，给用户带来了繁重的验证工作。在本文中，我们介绍了一种局部可归属的文本生成方法，重点放在简洁的属性上。我们的方法命名为“先增加属性，然后生成”，将传统的端到端生成过程分解为三个直观的步骤：内容选择、句子规划和序列句子生成。通过首先识别相关来源部分（“先选择”），然后在生成过程中对它们进行条件化（“然后生成”），我们确保这些部分也作为输出的细粒度属性（“选择”变为“属性”）。 在Mu上经过测试",
