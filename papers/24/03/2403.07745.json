    "translated_abstract": "论文研究随机向量$X$和$Z$，以及$Y=g(X,Z)$的情况。一方面，对于连续的$X$和$Z$，通过使用总变差和$g$的通量的思想，我们发展了一个在因果推断中能够处理广泛因果问题领域的视角。我们关注一个称为Probabilistic Easy Variational Causal Effect (PEACE)的函数，它可以测量$X$对$Y$的直接因果效应，而同时改变$X$的值，但保持$Z$的值不变。PEACE是关于$d\\ge 0$的一个函数，管理着概率密度值$f(x|z)$的强度。另一方面，我们将上述思想推广到离散情况，并展示其与连续情况的兼容性。此外，我们使用测度论概念研究了PEACE的一些性质。此外，我们提供了一些可辨识性标准。",
