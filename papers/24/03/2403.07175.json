    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.07175v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Recent work on model editing using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME), a popular model editing method, has shown that there are certain facts that the algorithm is unable to edit without breaking the model. Such edits have previously been called disabling edits. These disabling edits cause immediate model collapse and limits the use of ROME for sequential editing. In this paper, we make two main contributions. Firstly, we show that model collapse with ROME only happens when making edits using the CounterFact dataset and does not happen when using the zsRE dataset. Secondly, we find that disabling edits are an artifact of the original implementation of ROME. With this paper, we provide a more stable implementation ROME, which we call r-ROME and show that we no longer observe model collapse when making large scale sequential edits with ROME.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近关于使用Rank-One Model Editing (ROME)进行模型编辑的研究表明，有一些事实表明该算法无法进行编辑而不破坏模型。这些编辑以前被称为禁用编辑。这些禁用编辑会导致立即模型崩溃，并限制了ROME用于顺序编辑的使用。在本文中，我们做出了两个主要贡献。首先，我们展示了在使用CounterFact数据集进行编辑时，ROME仅在此时发生模型崩溃，并在使用zsRE数据集时不会发生。其次，我们发现禁用编辑是ROME原始实现的产物。通过本文，我们提供了一个更稳定的实现ROME，我们将其称为r-ROME，并展示我们在使用ROME进行大规模顺序编辑时不再观察到模型崩溃。",
