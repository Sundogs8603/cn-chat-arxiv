    "translated_abstract": "在去中心化环境中，异质客户端之间的有效协作在文献中是一个相当未被探索的领域。为了从结构上解决这个问题，我们引入了模型无关的点对点学习（简称MAPL），这是一种通过邻近客户端之间的点对点通信同时学习异质个性化模型和协作图的新方法。MAPL由两个主要模块组成：（i）本地级别的个性化模型学习（PML），利用客户端内部和客户端间对比损失的组合；（ii）网络范围的去中心化协作图学习（CGL），根据本地任务相似性以隐私保护的方式动态地优化协作权重。我们广泛的实验证明了MAPL的有效性，并且与其集中式模型无关的对应物相比，MAPL表现出竞争力（或者在大多数情况下更优），而且不依赖于任何中心服务器。",
