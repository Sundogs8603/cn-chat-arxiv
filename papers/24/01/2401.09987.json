    "translated_abstract": "扩展卡尔曼滤波器(EKF)是导航应用中广泛采用的传感器融合方法。EKF的一个关键方面是在线确定反映模型不确定性的过程噪声协方差矩阵。尽管常见的EKF实现假设过程噪声是恒定的，但在实际情况中，过程噪声是变化的，导致估计状态的不准确，并可能导致滤波器发散。为了应对这种情况，提出了基于模型的自适应EKF方法，并展示了性能改进，凸显了对稳健自适应方法的需求。在本文中，我们推导并引入了A-KIT，一种自适应的Kalman-informed transformer，用于在线学习变化的过程噪声协方差。A-KIT框架适用于任何类型的传感器融合。我们在这里介绍了基于惯性导航系统和多普勒速度日志的非线性传感器融合方法。通过使用来自自主无人潜水器的真实记录数据，我们验证了A-KIT的有效性。",
