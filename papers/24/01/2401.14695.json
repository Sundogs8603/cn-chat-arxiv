    "translated_abstract": "作为发展智能城市的关键技术，交通预测已成为学术界和工业界的研究焦点。由于交通网络中存在复杂且动态的时空依赖关系，这一任务具有很高的挑战性。现有研究忽视了随时间演化的连续时空依赖关系。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为持续演化图神经控制微分方程（CEGNCDE）的方法，可以同时捕捉连续的时空依赖关系和随时间演化的空间依赖关系。具体来说，我们引入了一个基于NCDE的持续演化图生成器（CEGG），用于从离散的历史观测中生成随时间演化的空间依赖图。然后，我们引入了一个名为图神经控制微分方程（GNCDE）的框架，可以同时捕捉连续的时空依赖关系和随时间演化的空间依赖关系。大量的实验结果表明，CEGNCDE方法在交通预测任务上取得了很好的性能。",
