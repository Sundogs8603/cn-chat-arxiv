    "translated_abstract": "各种有害的在线行为，从网络攻击到匿名流量和垃圾邮件，严重干扰了网络的正常运行。由于网络行为的发件人-收件人本质，常常使用基于图形的框架来检测异常行为。然而，在现实场景中，正常行为和异常行为之间的边界往往模糊不清。图的局部异质性干扰了检测过程，而基于节点或边的现有方法在表示结果中引入了不必要的噪声，从而影响了检测的有效性。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了PhoGAD，一种基于图形的异常检测框架。PhoGAD利用持久同调优化来澄清行为边界。在此基础上，设计了相邻边的权重以减轻局部异质性的影响。随后，为了解决噪声问题，我们进行了形式分析并提出了一个解耦的重新...",
