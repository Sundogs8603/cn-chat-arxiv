    "translated_abstract": "目标检测在提取局部类别信息方面被证明是一种重要的计算机视觉方法，并在工业中有多种应用。尽管许多最先进的目标检测模型在中等和大型目标上表现良好，但它们在小目标上表现不足。在大多数工业应用场景中，收集和注释小目标数据是困难的，因为这需要耗费时间且容易出现人为错误。此外，这些数据集往往不平衡，经常导致模型收敛效果不佳。为了解决这个挑战，本研究提出了一种新颖的方法，通过注入额外的数据点来改善目标检测模型的性能。使用合成数据生成技术，可以最小化收集和注释小目标数据点的困难，并创建一个具有平衡分布的数据集。本文讨论了一种简单的比例类平衡技术的效果，以实现模型的有效收敛。",
