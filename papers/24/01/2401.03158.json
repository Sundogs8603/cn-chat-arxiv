    "translated_abstract": "短文本分类（STC）对于处理和理解当代数字平台上流行的简洁而重要的内容至关重要。STC在抓住语义和句法复杂性方面遇到困难，这个问题在传统的预训练语言模型中很明显。尽管图卷积网络通过整合外部知识库提高了性能，但这些方法受到应用知识质量和范围的限制。最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）和思维链（CoT）的出现显著提高了复杂推理任务的性能。然而，一些研究指出了它们在基础NLP任务中的应用限制。因此，本研究旨在运用CoT来研究LLMs在STC任务中的能力。本研究引入了四步推理（QLFR）框架。这个框架主要包括句法和语义丰富的CoT，有效利用了LLMs的能力。",
