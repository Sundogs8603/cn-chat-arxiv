    "translated_abstract": "与仅追求推荐准确性相比，推荐模型的可解释性近年来更受关注。许多基于图的推荐方法使用关注机制来解释推荐过程中的路径。然而，这些关注权重是为了模型的准确性而设计的，而非可解释性。近期，一些研究者开始对基于关注机制的可解释性提出质疑，因为这些关注权重在不同的运行中是不稳定的，且不一定与人类的直觉一致。受因果学习理论中的反事实推理启发，我们提出了一种新颖的可解释框架，用于基于路径的推荐，其中通过学习路径的可解释权重来替代关注权重。具体来说，我们从路径表示和路径拓扑结构的角度设计了两种反事实推理算法。此外，与传统的案例研究不同，我们还提出了...",
