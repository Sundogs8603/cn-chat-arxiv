    "abstract": "For most developing countries, increasing the equalization of basic public services is widely recognized as an effective channel to improve people's sense of contentment. However, for many emerging economies like China, the equalization level of basic public services may often be neglected in the trade-off between the speed and quality of development. Taking the Yangtze River Delta region of China as an example, this paper first adopts the coupling coordination degree model to explore current status of basic public services in this region, and then uses Moran's I index to study the overall equalization level of development there. Moreover, this paper uses the Theil index to analyze the main reasons for the spatial differences in the level of public services, followed by the AF method to accurately identify the exact weaknesses of the 40 counties of 10 cities with the weakest level of basic public service development. Based on this, this paper provides targeted optimization initiatives ",

    "translated_title": "合作还是竞争？中国区域现代化与公共服务均衡的一瞥：以中国为案例研究",
    "translated_abstract": "对于大多数发展中国家来说，增加基本公共服务的均衡被广泛认为是提高人们幸福感的有效途径。然而，对于中国等许多新兴经济体来说，在速度和质量发展的权衡中，基本公共服务的均衡水平往往会被忽视。以中国长江三角洲地区为例，本文首先采用耦合协调度模型来探索该地区基本公共服务的现状，然后利用Moran's I指数研究该地区整体发展的均衡水平。此外，本文还利用Theil指数分析公共服务水平空间差异的主要原因，并使用AF方法准确识别出基本公共服务发展水平最弱的10个城市40个县的确切缺点。基于此，本文提供了针对性的优化举措。",
