    "abstract": "We are developing techniques to generate summary descriptions of sets of objects. In this paper, we present and evaluate a rule-based NLG technique for summarising sets of bibliographical references in academic papers. This extends our previous work on summarising sets of consumer products and shows how our model generalises across these two very different domains.",
