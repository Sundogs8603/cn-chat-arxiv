    "translated_abstract": "与准确传递符号相比，以准确传递意义为目标的语义通信已成为一个越来越受关注的领域。这种范式通常利用人工智能和机器学习的现代发展，以提高通信系统的效率和鲁棒性。然而，对于捕捉和量化“意义”的细节缺乏一个标准模型，许多领先的语义通信方法采用黑盒框架，对模型的具体学习内容知之甚少。一种解决方案是利用概念空间框架，以几何方式明确建模意义。虽然以前使用概念空间研究语义通信的工作已经取得了良好的结果，但这些先前的尝试涉及手工制作概念空间模型，严重限制了该方法的可扩展性和实用性。在这项工作中，我们开发了一个学习框架，用于学习一个自编码器，实现概念空间语义通信。",
