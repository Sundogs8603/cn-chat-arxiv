Firstly, we analyze the reasons of these problems from the perspective of DRL's observation, revealing that the traditional design causes DRL to be interfered by irrelevant map information. Secondly, we develop the LOPA which utilizes a novel attention-enhanced mechanism to attain an improved attention capability towards the key information of the observation. Such a mechanism is realized by two steps: (1) an attention model is built to transform the DRL's observation into two dynamic views: local and global, significantly guiding the LOPA to focus on the key information on the given maps; (2) a dual-channel network is constructed to process these two",

    "translated_abstract": "深度强化学习(DRL)方法在路径规划任务中显示出了很大的潜力。然而，在处理全局规划任务时，这些方法面临着收敛性和泛化性等严重的挑战。为此，我们在本文中提出了一种名为LOPA（Learn Once Plan Arbitrarily）的增强注意力深度强化学习方法。首先，我们从DRL的观察角度分析了这些问题的原因，揭示了传统设计导致DRL受到无关地图信息的干扰。其次，我们开发了LOPA，利用一种新颖的增强注意力机制，以改善对观察中关键信息的注意力能力。这种机制通过两个步骤实现：(1)构建一个注意力模型，将DRL的观察转换为两个动态视图：局部和全局，显著指导LOPA关注给定地图上的关键信息；(2)构建一个双通道网络来处理这两个视图。",
