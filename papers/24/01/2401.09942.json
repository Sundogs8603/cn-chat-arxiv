    "translated_abstract": "对于分析足球视频来说，有效的球员跟踪和重新识别是至关重要的。然而，由于球员的非线性运动、来自同一团队的球员外观的相似性以及频繁的遮挡，这是一项具有挑战性的任务。因此，提取有意义的嵌入表示以代表球员对于开发有效的跟踪和重新识别系统至关重要。本文提出了一种名为PRTreID的多用途基于部件的人物表示方法，它同时执行角色分类、团队归属和重新识别这三个任务。与现有文献不同的是，使用多任务监督训练了一个单一网络来解决所有三个任务。由于共享的主干网络，所提出的联合方法具有较低的计算复杂度。此外，多任务学习导致了更丰富和更有区别度的表示，这通过定量和定性结果都得到了证实。为了展示",
