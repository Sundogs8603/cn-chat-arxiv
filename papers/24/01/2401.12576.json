    "translated_abstract": "提供以对话形式进行解释的可解释性工具已经证明在增强用户理解方面具有效果，因为一次性解释有时无法提供足够的信息给用户。然而，当前基于对话的解释方案需要许多依赖项，并且不容易转移到它们未设计的任务上。通过LLMCheckup，我们提供了一个易于访问的工具，允许用户与任何最新的大型语言模型（LLM）进行对话以了解其行为。我们使LLMs能够自行生成所有解释，并通过与一系列可解释性AI（XAI）工具（例如特征归因、基于嵌入的相似性以及反事实和基于理由生成的提示策略）连接，以完成意图识别而无需微调。LLM（自我）解释以交互对话的形式呈现，支持后续问题和生成建议。",
