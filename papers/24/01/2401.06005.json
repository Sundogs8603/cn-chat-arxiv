    "translated_abstract": "视觉被广泛理解为一种推理问题。然而，在生物视觉研究和机器视觉工程中，关于推理过程的两种对立观念都具有影响力。第一种强调自下而上的信号流动，将视觉描述为一种主要是前馈的判别推理过程，其通过滤除不相关的变异和以适合下游的认知和行为控制功能需要的方式来转换视觉信息，并代表行为上相关信息。在这种观念中，视觉由感官数据驱动，感知是直接的，因为处理从数据到感兴趣的潜变量的过程进行。在这种观念中，\"推理\"的概念类似于神经网络的工程文献中描述的，对图像进行处理的前馈卷积神经网络被认为是在执行推理。而另一种观念是将视觉视为Helmholtz的推理过程。",
