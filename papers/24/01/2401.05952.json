    "translated_abstract": "随着大型语言模型（LLM）的显著发展和广泛应用，机器生成文本（MGT）的使用正变得越来越普遍。这一趋势带来了潜在的风险，特别是对于新闻和教育等领域信息的质量和完整性而言。目前的研究主要解决检测纯MGT而未充分解决包括AI修改的人工文本（HWT）或经人工修改的MGT在内的混合情景。为了应对这一挑战，我们引入了混合大小写（mixcase）这一新概念，表示一种同时涉及机器生成和人工生成内容的混合文本形式。我们收集了来自多个日常文本编辑场景的mixcase实例，并构建了MixSet，这是专用于研究这些混合修改情景的第一个数据集。我们进行实验来评估流行的MGT检测器的效果、稳健性和泛化性能。我们的结果显示现有的MGT检测器对于混合文本的检测效果不理想。",
