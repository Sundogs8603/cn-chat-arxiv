    "translated_abstract": "现象学（P型）分岔是随机动力系统中的定性变化，其中稳态概率密度函数（PDF）改变了其拓扑结构。目前检测这些分岔的技术需要可靠的核密度估计，而这需要从系统实现集合中计算得到。然而，在一些真实世界的信号中，比如大数据，只有一个系统实现可用，因此无法估计可靠的核密度。本研究提出一种使用不可靠密度估计检测P型分岔的方法。该方法利用了一种称为拓扑数据分析（TDA）的技术从系统的单个实现中创建了一个对象集合，并对结果集进行统计分析。我们比较了复制原始持久化图的几种方法，包括Gibbs点过程建模、成对交互点建模和子采样。我们表明，这些方法在预测方面是有效的。",
