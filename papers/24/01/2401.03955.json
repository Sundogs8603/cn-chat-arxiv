    "translated_abstract": "零/少样本学习的大型预训练模型在语言和视觉领域表现出色，但在多变量时间序列 (TS) 中面临着多样性和公开预训练数据稀缺的挑战。因此，最近在时间序列预测中使用预训练的大型语言模型 (LLMs) 进行各种适应的趋势逐渐增加。这些方法利用跨领域迁移学习，出奇地取得了令人印象深刻的结果。然而，这些模型通常非常缓慢且庞大（大约十亿个参数），并且不考虑跨通道相关性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了多层微小时间混合器 (TTM)，这是一种基于轻量级 TSMixer 结构的显著小型模型。TTM 是首个成功开发的微型通用预训练模型（≤100万个参数），专门在公开TS数据集上进行快速训练（仅需4-8小时），具有有效的迁移学习能力进行预测。",
    "tldr": "本论文介绍了一种名为微小时间混合器 (TTMs) 的预训练模型，该模型针对多变量时间序列的零/少样本预测进行了优化。与大型预训练模型相比，TTMs模型更小、更快，并考虑了跨通道相关性，能够在短时间内进行有效的预测。"
