    "translated_abstract": "在医疗领域中，总结患者提出的医疗问题对于改善医患互动和医疗决策至关重要。虽然医疗数据的复杂性和数量不断增长，但目前在这个领域的研究主要集中在基于文本的方法上，忽视了视觉线索的整合。此外，在医学问题总结的领域中，之前的研究仅限于英语语言。本研究引入了在低资源环境下针对混合码输入进行多模态医学问题总结的任务。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了Multimodal Medical Codemixed Question Summarization（MMCQS）数据集，该数据集结合了Hindi-English混合码医学查询和视觉辅助工具。这种整合丰富了患者的医疗状况的表示，提供了更全面的视角。我们还提出了一个名为MedSumm的框架，利用LLMs和VLMs的能力来完成这个任务。",
