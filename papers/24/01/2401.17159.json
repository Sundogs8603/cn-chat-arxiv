    "translated_abstract": "现代SMT求解器（例如Z3）提供用户可控的策略，使用户能够根据自己的实例集定制求解器，从而显著提高求解器在特定用例中的性能。然而，这种策略定制的方法带来了一个重要挑战：为一类SMT实例手工设计一个优化的策略仍然是求解器开发人员和用户面临的复杂和艰巨任务。在本文中，我们通过一种新颖的基于蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）的方法来解决这个自动进行SMT策略合成的问题。我们的方法将策略合成视为一种序列决策过程，其搜索树对应于策略空间，并利用MCTS来遍历这个庞大的搜索空间。使我们的方法能够在保持成本低的同时找到有效的策略的关键创新是分层和分阶段的MCTS搜索的理念。这些新颖的方法允许对策略空间进行更深入和更高效的探索。",
