    "abstract": "Numerous robust estimators exist as alternatives to the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) when a completely observed ground-up loss severity sample dataset is available. However, the options for robust alternatives to MLE become significantly limited when dealing with grouped loss severity data, with only a handful of methods like least squares, minimum Hellinger distance, and optimal bounded influence function available. This paper introduces a novel robust estimation technique, the Method of Truncated Moments (MTuM), specifically designed to estimate the tail index of a Pareto distribution from grouped data. Inferential justification of MTuM is established by employing the central limit theorem and validating them through a comprehensive simulation study.",

    "translated_abstract": "当可获取的完全观测到的从头至尾的损失严重性样本数据集存在时，存在许多稳健估计器作为最大似然估计器（MLE）的替代方案。然而，当处理分组损失严重性数据时，稳健的MLE替代方案的选择变得非常有限，只有少数方法可用，例如最小二乘法、最小Hellinger距离和最优有界影响函数。本文介绍了一种称为截断矩法的新型稳健估计技术，该方法专门用于从分组数据估计Pareto分布的尾指数。通过应用中心极限定理和通过全面的模拟研究验证了MTuM的推理合理性。",
