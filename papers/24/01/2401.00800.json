    "translated_abstract": "因子重要性衡量了每个特征对输出预测准确性的影响。许多现有的研究关注基于模型的重要性，但一个学习算法中的重要特征在另一个模型中可能没有多大意义。因此，一个因子重要性度量应该在不依赖于特定预测算法的情况下表征特征的预测潜力。该算法无关的重要性被称为内在重要性。为了绕过建模过程，我们介绍了预测潜力与全局敏感性分析中的总Sobol'指数之间的等价性，并引入了一种新的一致估计器，可以直接从有噪声的数据中估计。结合正向选择和反向消除，我们提出了FIRST，即使用总（Sobol'）指数进行因子重要性排名和选择。我们提供了大量的仿真实验来证明FIRST的有效性。",
