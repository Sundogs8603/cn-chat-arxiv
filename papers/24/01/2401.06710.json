    "translated_abstract": "在现代营销活动中，根据消费者状态选择广告行动的灵活性至关重要。我们研究了识别最优顺序个性化干预以最大化针对新产品的采纳概率的问题。我们通过一个转化漏斗模型来建模消费者行为，该模型捕捉到每个消费者的状态（例如与公司的互动历史）并允许消费者行为随着其状态和公司的顺序干预而变化。我们展示了我们的模型在真实世界的电子邮件营销数据集中以非常高的准确度（超过0.95的样本外AUC）捕捉到消费者行为。然而，这导致了一个非常大规模的学习问题，公司必须从消费者交互中学习各种干预的状态特定效应。我们提出了一个新的基于归因的决策算法来解决这个问题，我们称之为无模型近似贝叶斯学习。",
