    "translated_abstract": "学习多变量时间序列和动态网络等时间变化的对象需要开发新的知识表示机制和神经网络架构，以捕捉数据中的隐含的时间相关信息。这些信息通常不直接观察到，但在学习任务性能中起着关键作用。然而，对于时间相关数据而言，知识编码机制中缺少时间维度会导致频繁的模型更新，学习性能差，从而影响决策的质量。在这里，我们提出了一种新的时间感知知识表示机制的方法，特别关注多个几何维度上的隐含时间相关拓扑信息。具体而言，我们提出了一种名为 \\textit{Temporal MultiPersistence} (TMP) 的新方法，通过使用现有的单参数拓扑摘要，生成数据的多维拓扑指纹。",
