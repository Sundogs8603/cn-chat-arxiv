    "translated_abstract": "高层次综合（HLS）通过避免RTL编程显着加快了硬件设计过程。然而，在优化过程中考虑后向路结果质量（QoR）时，HLS的周转时间显著增加。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种用于FPGA HLS的分层后向路QoR预测方法，具有以下特点：（1）直接从C / C ++程序估计延迟和后向路资源使用的建模流程；（2）有效表示源代码的控制和数据流图以及HLS伪指令的影响的图构建方法；（3）能够捕获循环层次影响的分层GNN训练和预测方法。实验结果显示，与最先进的GNN方法相比，我们的方法在不同类型的QoR指标下的预测误差小于10%，取得了巨大的改进。通过采用我们提出的方法论，在HLS的设计空间探索中减少了运行时。",
