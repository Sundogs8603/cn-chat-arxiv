    "translated_abstract": "随着HUDOC等法律案例法数据库的快速增长，为了处理如此大规模的数据集，法律研究人员找到高效的方法变得至关重要。这种案例法数据库通常包含案件的文本内容以及它们之间的引用。本文重点研究了来自欧洲人权法院关于欧洲人权公约第8条关于尊重私人和家庭生活、家庭和通信权利的案例法。在本研究中，我们演示并比较了主题建模和引用网络在根据一般主题和引用模式找到和组织第8条案例法方面的潜力。另外，我们还探索了结合这两种技术是否比仅应用其中一种方法效果更好。我们在一组手工收集和注释的关于驱逐的第8条案例法独特数据集上评估了组合方法的有效性。我们的结果表明，结合使用这两种方法能够取得更好的效果。",
