    "translated_title": "具有全局感知增强的时空图递归网络：交通流量预测的新框架",
    "translated_abstract": "交通流量预测在减少交通拥堵和提高运输效率方面起着至关重要的作用。虽然将图卷积网络与循环神经网络相结合进行时空建模在这个领域是一种常见的策略，但是循环神经网络的受限结构限制了它们捕捉全局信息的能力。对于空间建模，许多之前的研究学习一个被假设为固定且在所有时间步骤上均匀的图结构，这可能并不正确。本文提出了一种新颖的交通预测框架，称为全局感知增强时空图递归网络（GA-STGRN），包括两个核心组件：时空图递归神经网络和全局感知层。在这个框架中，提出了三个创新的预测模型。提出了一种序列感知的图神经网络，并将其整合到门控循环单元（GRU）中，以学习不同时间步骤下非固定的图形并捕捉局部特征。",
