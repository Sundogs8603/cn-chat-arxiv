    "translated_abstract": "预测聚合通过结合多个预测器的预测结果来提高准确性。然而，对于预测器信息结构的缺乏了解阻碍了最优聚合的实现。在给定信息结构族的情况下，算法鲁棒的预测聚合旨在找到与全知聚合相比具有最小最坏情况遗憾的聚合器。先前的算法鲁棒预测聚合方法依赖于经验观察和参数调整。我们提出了一种算法框架用于算法鲁棒的预测聚合。我们的框架针对具有有限信息结构族的普遍信息聚合问题提供了高效的逼近方案。在Arieli等人（2018）研究的情境下，其中两个代理接收与二进制状态有关的独立信号，我们的框架还可以通过对聚合器施加Lipschitz条件或对代理报告施加离散条件来提供高效的逼近方案。数值实验证明了我们的算法框架的优越性能。",
