    "translated_abstract": "检索增强生成（RAG）系统相对于传统的大型语言模型（LLMs）代表了一个重大进步。RAG系统通过整合通过信息检索（IR）阶段检索的外部数据来增强其生成能力，克服了标准LLMs的限制，后者仅限于其预先训练的知识和有限的上下文窗口。这个领域的大部分研究主要集中在RAG系统内LLMs的生成方面。我们的研究填补了这一空白，通过全面而批判性地分析IR组件对RAG系统的影响。本文分析了一个检索器在有效的RAG的提示表述中应该具备的特征，重点关注应该检索哪种类型的文档。我们评估了各种因素，如文档与提示的相关性，它们的位置以及上下文中包含的数量。我们的发现揭示出，包含不相关的文档可能会…",
