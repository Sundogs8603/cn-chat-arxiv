    "translated_abstract": "近年来，车辆中复杂的软件驱动功能呈指数增长，导致电子控制单元(ECU)、网络能力和接口数量不断增加。扩展的功能也带来了新的漏洞层面，使入侵检测和管理成为关键能力；然而，这往往会导致更多的ECU和网络元素，因为计算开销很高。在本文中，我们提出了一种整合的ECU架构，包括基于现成混合FPGA设备的汽车控制器区域网络(CAN)入侵检测系统(IDS)，以及传统ECU功能，对于ECU功能几乎没有开销。我们提出了两种量化的多层感知机(QMLP)作为独立的IDS，用于检测一系列攻击向量，包括拒绝服务、模糊测试和欺骗攻击，并使用来自Xilinx的现成深度学习处理单元(DPU)IP块进行加速。",
