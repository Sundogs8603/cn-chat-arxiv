In this paper, we introduce \"IdentiFace\" which is a multimodal facial biometric system that combines the core of facial recognition with some of the most important soft biometric traits such as gender, face shape, and emotion. We also focused on developing the system using only VGG-16 inspired architecture with minor changes across different subsystems. This unification allows for simpler integration across modalities. It makes it easier to interpret the learned features between the tasks which gives a good indication about the decision-making process across the facial modalities and potential connection. For the recognition problem, we acquired a 99.2% test accuracy for five classes with high intra-class variations using data collected ",

    "translated_abstract": "人脸生物特征系统的发展为计算机视觉领域的发展做出了巨大贡献。现今，需要开发一种多模态系统，以高效、有意义的方式结合多种生物特征。本文介绍了“IdentiFace”，这是一种多模态人脸生物特征系统，将人脸识别的核心与性别、脸型和情感等一些重要的软生物特征相结合。我们还着重使用只有VGG-16受到启发的架构，在不同子系统中进行了一些细微的更改。这种统一性使得跨模态的集成更加简单。它更容易解释不同任务之间学到的特征，从而对于决策过程和人脸模态之间的潜在关系给出了很好的指示。对于识别问题，我们使用收集的数据，在五个类别的高内类别变异下获得了99.2%的测试精确度。",
