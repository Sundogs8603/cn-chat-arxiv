Inspired by the way that infants interact with the world, GExp encourages robots to understand and explore the environment with a series of self-generated tasks.

    "translated_abstract": "智能机器人是机器人领域的最终目标。现有工作通过基于学习或优化的方法来完成人类定义的任务。然而，使机器人能够自主地探索各种环境的挑战仍未解决。在本研究中，我们提出了一个名为GExp的框架，可以使机器人在没有人类干预的情况下自主探索和学习。为了实现这个目标，我们设计了包括自我探索、知识库构建和闭环反馈在内的基于基础模型的模块。受到婴儿与世界互动方式的启发，GExp鼓励机器人通过一系列自动生成的任务来理解和探索环境。在探索过程中，机器人将从有益的经验中获得有用于将来的技能。GExp使机器人通过自我探索解决复杂任务。",
