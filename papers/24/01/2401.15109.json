    "translated_abstract": "群体智能（SI）是一种自然现象，能够通过形成实时系统来增强生物群体的综合智力。人工群体智能（或群体AI）是一种技术，能够通过形成类似系统来增强网络化人类群体的综合智能。过去，基于群体的方法仅限于狭义任务，如概率预测和多项选择决策。一种名为对话群体智能（CSI）的新技术于2023年开发出来，通过自然对话讨论来增强网络人类群体的决策精度。本研究评估了使用CSI平台的实时群体参加一种被称为Raven高级渐进矩阵（RAPM）的常见智商测试的能力。首先，基准组参与者通过传统调查方式接受了Raven智商测试。这个组的平均正确率为45.6%。然后，大约35人的群体回答了同样的智商测试。",
