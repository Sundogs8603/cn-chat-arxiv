    "abstract": "We tackle the problem of computing a consensus according to multiple ethical principles -- which can include, for example, the principle of maximum freedom associated with the Benthamite doctrine and the principle of maximum fairness associated with the Rawlsian principles -- among the preferences of different individuals in the context of Group-Decision-Making.

Our contribution incurs obvious benefits from a social-choice perspective. Firstly, our approach significantly generalises state-of-the-art approaches that were limited to only two ethical principles (p set to one, for maximum freedom, and p set to infinity, for maximum fairness).

    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了在群体决策的背景下，根据多个伦理原则（例如，与本塔姆学说相关的最大自由原则和与洛尔斯原则相关的最大公平原则）计算共识的问题。我们提出了一个基于多规范逼近问题的创新形式化方法，该方法旨在最小化多个p度量距离函数，其中每个参数p代表一个给定的伦理原则。我们的贡献在社会选择的角度具有明显的好处。首先，我们的方法显着推广了仅针对两个伦理原则（p设置为1，用于最大自由；p设置为无穷大，用于最大公平）的最新方法。其次，我们的实验结果考虑了一个已建立的测试案例，证明了我们的方法的有效性。",
