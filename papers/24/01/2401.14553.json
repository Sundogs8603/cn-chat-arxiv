    "abstract": "In this article we consider an aggregate loss model with dependent losses. The losses occurrence process is governed by a two-state Markovian arrival process (MAP2), a Markov renewal process process that allows for (1) correlated inter-losses times, (2) non-exponentially distributed inter-losses times and, (3) overdisperse losses counts. Some quantities of interest to measure persistence in the loss occurrence process are obtained. Given a real operational risk database, the aggregate loss model is estimated by fitting separately the inter-losses times and severities. The MAP2 is estimated via direct maximization of the likelihood function, and severities are modeled by the heavy-tailed, double-Pareto Lognormal distribution. In comparison with the fit provided by the Poisson process, the results point out that taking into account the dependence and overdispersion in the inter-losses times distribution leads to higher capital charges.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了具有相关损失的聚合损失模型。损失的发生过程由一个双状态马尔可夫到达过程（MAP2）管理，这是一个允许存在（1）相关的损失间隔时间，（2）非指数分布的损失间隔时间和（3）超离散的损失计数的马尔可夫更新过程。我们获得了一些用于衡量损失发生过程中持续性的相关数量。给定一个实际的操作风险数据库，聚合损失模型通过分别拟合损失间隔时间和损失程度来进行估计。MAP2是通过直接最大化似然函数来估计的，而损失程度则是通过重尾的双参数对数正态分布进行建模。与泊松过程提供的拟合结果相比，结果表明考虑损失间隔时间的相关性和超离散性会导致更高的资本金计提。",
