    "translated_abstract": "计算机视觉中的主要问题是检测小型、不确定的移动物体或在遮挡环境中具有杂乱背景的物体。这严重影响了深度学习模型的检测准确性。为了克服这些问题，我们集中研究了在遮挡环境中利用SSD和YOLO算法进行实时汽车和坦克检测的深度学习模型，并改善了检测精度，减少了这些模型面临的问题。所开发的方法构建了自定义数据集，并采用预处理技术清除嘈杂的数据集。为了训练所开发的模型，我们应用了数据增强技术来平衡和丰富数据。通过应用这些技术并突出展示我们得到的结果，我们对已建立的数据集上的这些模型进行了微调、训练和评估，比不应用这些技术时得到了更准确的精度和每秒帧数。SSD-Mobilenet v2模型的准确性和帧率均高于其他模型。",
