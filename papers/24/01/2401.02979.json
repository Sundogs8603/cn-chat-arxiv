In this article, we investigate this uncertainty for the domain of characterizations of expressive piano performance. Using a music research dataset of free text performance characterizations and a follow-up study sorting the annotations into clusters, we derive a ground truth for a domain-specific semantic similarity structure. We test five embedding models and their similarity structure for correspondence with the ground truth.

    "translated_abstract": "语义嵌入在基于自然语言的信息检索中起到至关重要的作用。嵌入模型将单词和上下文表示为向量，其空间配置是根据大型文本语料库中单词的分布导出的。尽管这些表示一般非常强大，但它们可能未能考虑到细粒度的领域特定细微差别。在本文中，我们探讨了这种对表现力钢琴演奏特征的不确定性。我们使用一个音乐研究数据集，其中包含自由文本演奏特征的注释，并进行了一个后续研究，将注释分类成不同的聚类。我们得出了一个特定领域语义相似性结构的真值。我们测试了五个嵌入模型及其相似性结构与真值的对应关系。我们进一步评估了上下文提示、中心度降低、跨模态相似性和k-means聚类的影响。嵌入模型的质量在这方面显示出很大的差异性。",
