    "abstract": "Modeling long histories plays a pivotal role in enhancing recommendation systems, allowing to capture user's evolving preferences, resulting in more precise and personalized recommendations. In this study we tackle the challenges of modeling long user histories for preference understanding in natural language. Specifically, we introduce a new User Embedding Module (UEM) that efficiently processes user history in free-form text by compressing and representing them as embeddings, to use them as soft prompts to a LM. Our experiments demonstrate the superior capability of this approach in handling significantly longer histories compared to conventional text based prompting methods, yielding substantial improvements in predictive performance. The main contribution of this research is to demonstrate the ability to bias language models with user signals represented as embeddings.",

    "translated_abstract": "对于提升推荐系统的模型，建模长时间的历史记录起到了关键作用，能够捕捉用户不断演变的偏好，从而得到更准确和个性化的推荐。本研究致力于解决自然语言偏好理解中建模长用户历史记录的挑战。具体地，我们引入了一种新的用户嵌入模块(UEM)，通过将用户历史记录以嵌入形式压缩和表示，将其作为对语言模型的软提示。我们的实验表明，与传统的基于文本的提示方法相比，这种方法在处理显著更长的历史记录方面具有卓越的能力，并在预测性能方面取得了实质性的改进。该研究的主要贡献在于展示了使用表示为嵌入的用户信号来偏置语言模型的能力。",
