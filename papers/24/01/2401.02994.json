    "translated_abstract": "在会话型AI研究中，越来越多的模型采用了更多的参数，如ChatGPT等模型。虽然这些庞大的模型往往能生成更好的聊天回复，但它们需要大量的计算资源和内存。本研究探讨了一个重要问题：能否通过组合较小的模型来达到与单个大模型相当或更好的性能？我们提出了一种称为“混合”的方法，它是一种简单但有效的将多个聊天AI集成在一起的方法。我们的实证证据表明，当特定较小的模型协同混合时，它们可以潜在地超越或匹敌大型模型的性能。例如，仅集成三个适度规模的模型（6B/13B参数）就可以达到或甚至超越ChatGPT（175B+参数）等大型模型的性能指标。这个假设经过了严格的测试。",
