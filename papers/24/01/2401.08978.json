    "translated_abstract": "经验过程理论已经成为理解各种统计问题泛用工具的独特工具，尤其适用于独立同分布观测数据。然而，在许多数据呈现时间依赖性的应用中（如金融、医学影像、天气预报等），相应的经验过程则了解得不多。受到这一观察的启发，我们提出了在标准的β/ρ混合假设下经验过程期望上确界的一般界限。与大多数现有工作不同，我们的结果涵盖了长期和短期依赖的情况。我们的主要结果显示，在大类非参数问题中，底层函数类的复杂性和观测之间的依赖性之间存在一种非平凡的权衡，这一权衡决定了学习速率。这种权衡揭示了一种新现象，即在长期依赖情况下，也可以达到与独立同分布设置相同的速率，证。",
