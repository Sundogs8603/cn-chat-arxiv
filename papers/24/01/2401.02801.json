    "translated_abstract": "数据中心交换机中的数据包缓冲区被共享在所有交换机端口上，以提高整体吞吐量。数据中心交换机缓冲区大小不断缩小的趋势使得缓冲区共享变得极具挑战性，成为关键的性能问题。文献表明，推出式缓冲区共享算法相对于丢弃式算法具有显着的性能保证。不幸的是，由于硬件不支持推出操作，交换机无法从这些算法中受益。我们的关键观察是，如果未来数据包到达的时间事先知道，丢弃式缓冲区可以模拟推出式缓冲区。这表明，将关于未来到达的预测与丢弃式算法相结合可以显著提高性能。本文是这个方向上的首次研究尝试。我们提出了Credence，一种使用机器学习预测增强的丢弃式缓冲区共享算法。",
