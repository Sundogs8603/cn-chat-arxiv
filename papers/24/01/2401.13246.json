    "translated_abstract": "阐明从问题到答案的推理过程，通过结构化解释是根本重要的，因为它显著增强了问答系统的解释性和可信度。然而，结构化解释要求模型进行复杂的结构化推理，这带来了巨大的挑战。大多数现有方法集中在通过监督学习进行单步推理，忽视步骤之间的逻辑依赖关系。同时，现有的基于强化学习（RL）的方法忽视了结构化关系，阻碍了RL在结构化推理中的潜力。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为SEER的新方法，通过最大化基于结构的回报，以促进结构化推理和解释。我们提出的基于结构的回报准确描述了结构化推理中固有的分层和分支结构，有效地捕捉了状态之间的复杂关系。我们还引入了一种细粒度的奖励函数。",
