    "translated_abstract": "在社交推荐中，利用社交关系来解决用户-物品交互数据稀疏性问题，基于社交同质性的假设。然而，社交推荐范式主要关注基于用户偏好的同质性。虽然社交信息可以增强推荐效果，但它与用户偏好的一致性并不保证，从而可能引入信息冗余。我们经验性地发现，真实的推荐数据中的社交图展现出低偏好感知的同质性，这限制了社交推荐模型的作用。为了全面提取社交图中潜在的偏好感知同质性信息，我们提出了Social Heterophily-alleviating Rewiring (SHaRe)，这是一个以数据为中心的框架，用于增强现有基于图的社交推荐模型。我们采用图重连技术来捕捉和添加高度同质的社交关系，并剪切低同质（或异质）关系。为了更好地优化从社交图中提取的推荐模式的刻画，我们还引入基于图的用户偏好分布修正方法。",
