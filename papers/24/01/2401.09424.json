    "abstract": "Precipitation prediction plays a crucial role in modern agriculture and industry. However, it poses significant challenges due to the diverse patterns and dynamics in time and space, as well as the scarcity of high precipitation events.  To address this challenge, we propose an ensemble learning framework that leverages multiple learners to capture the diverse patterns of precipitation distribution. Specifically, the framework consists of a precipitation predictor with multiple lightweight heads (learners) and a controller that combines the outputs from these heads. The learners and the controller are separately optimized with a proposed 3-stage training scheme.  By utilizing provided satellite images, the proposed approach can effectively model the intricate rainfall patterns, especially for high precipitation events. It achieved 1st place on the core test as well as the nowcasting leaderboards of the Weather4Cast 2023 competition. For detailed implementation, please refer to our GitH",

    "translated_abstract": "降水预测在现代农业和工业中起着至关重要的作用，然而由于时间和空间上多样的模式和动态以及高降水事件的稀缺性，它也带来了重大挑战。为了应对这一挑战，我们提出了一个集成学习框架，利用多个学习器来捕捉降水分布的多样模式。具体来说，该框架包括一个具有多个轻量级头部（学习器）的降水预测器和一个控制器，该控制器将这些头部的输出组合起来。学习器和控制器分别通过提出的3阶段训练方案进行优化。通过利用提供的卫星图像，这种方法可以有效地建模复杂的降雨模式，特别是对于高降水事件。它在Weather4Cast 2023竞赛的核心测试和即时预测排行榜上取得了第一名。有关详细实现，请参考我们的GitH",
