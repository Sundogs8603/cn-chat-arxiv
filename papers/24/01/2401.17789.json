    "translated_abstract": "神经图像压缩取得了很大的进展。最先进的模型基于变分自编码器，胜过了传统模型。神经压缩模型学会将图像编码为量化的潜变量表示，然后将其高效地发送给解码器，解码器再将量化的潜变量解码为重建图像。虽然这些模型在实践中取得了成功，但由于优化不完美以及编码器和解码器容量的限制，它们导致了次优结果。最近的研究表明，如何利用随机Gumbel退火（SGA）来改进预训练的神经图像压缩模型的潜变量。我们通过引入SGA+扩展了这个想法，SGA+包含了三种不同的方法，这些方法都建立在SGA的基础上。此外，我们对我们提出的方法进行了详细分析，展示了它们如何改进性能，并且证明它们对超参数选择不敏感。此外，我们还展示了如何将每个方法扩展到三个而不是两个。",
