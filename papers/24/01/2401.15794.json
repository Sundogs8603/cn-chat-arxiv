    "translated_abstract": "考虑到在竞争市场中，卖方使用算法根据他们收集到的数据调整价格。在这种情况下，算法可能得出高于竞争价格的价格，从而使卖方受益，而损害消费者（即市场中的买方）。本文为定价算法提供了合理的算法非合谋的定义。该定义允许监管机构通过对所收集数据的统计测试来对算法进行实证审计。良好的算法，即在市场条件下近似优化价格的算法，可以通过增加足够数据来通过审计。相反，达到高于竞争价格的算法无法通过审计。该定义允许卖方拥有与供需相互关联且可能影响良好算法所使用的价格的有用辅助信息。本文还分析了统计互补性。",

Good algorithms can pass the audit by augmenting their data, while algorithms that result in prices higher than competition cannot pass the audit."
