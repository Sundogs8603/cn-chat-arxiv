    "translated_abstract": "表面活性剂在化妆品、洗涤剂、油田回收和药物传递系统等不同工业领域中具有高度重要性。因此，已经开发了许多用于表面活性剂的定量结构-性能关系（QSPR）模型。每个预测模型通常侧重于一类表面活性剂，主要是非离子表面活性剂。图神经网络（GNNs）在离子液体、聚合物和药物等领域的性能预测中表现出了很好的预测性能。对于表面活性剂，GNNs可以成功预测关键胶束浓度（CMC），这是与胶束化相关的关键表面活性剂性质。对于QSPR和GNN模型的预测能力的一个关键因素是用于训练的数据的可用性。基于广泛的文献调研，我们创建了最大的可用CMC数据库，其中包含429个分子，并且首次进行了与泡沫相关的另一表面活性剂性质——表面迁移浓度（$\\Gamma$$_{m}$）的大型数据收集，其中包含164个分子。",
