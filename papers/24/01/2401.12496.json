Extensive research has been conducted over time to apply these human tactile abilities to robots. In this paper, we introduce a multi-finger robot system designed to search for and manipulate objects using the sense of touch without relying on visual information. Randomly located target objects are searched using tactile sensors, and the objects are manipulated for tasks that mimic daily-life. The objective of the study is to endow robots with human-like tactile capabilities. To achieve this, binary tactile sensors are implemented on one side of the robot hand to minimize the Sim2Real gap. Training the policy through reinforcement learning in simulation and transferring the trained policy to the real environment, we demonstrate that object search and manipulation using tactile sensors is possible even in ",

    "translated_abstract": "触觉能力对于熟练执行各种任务是至关重要的，它能够在没有依赖于视觉信息的情况下搜索和操作物体。随着时间的推移，已经进行了大量研究将人类的触觉能力应用于机器人。在本文中，我们介绍了一个多指机器人系统，旨在利用触觉感受器搜索和操作物体，而不依赖于视觉信息。使用触觉传感器来搜索随机放置的目标物体，并进行模拟日常任务的物体操作。本研究的目标是赋予机器人类似人类的触觉能力。为了实现这一目标，我们在机器人手的一侧实现了二值触觉传感器，以尽量减少模拟与真实环境之间的差距。通过在仿真中通过强化学习训练策略，并将训练好的策略转移到真实环境中，我们证明了使用触觉传感器进行物体搜索和操作是可行的，即使在没有依赖于视觉信息的情况下。",
