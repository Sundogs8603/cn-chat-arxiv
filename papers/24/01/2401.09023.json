    "abstract": "Cyberbullying has become a big issue with the popularity of different social media networks and online communication apps. While plenty of research is going on to develop better models for cyberbullying detection in monolingual language, there is very little research on the code-mixed languages and explainability aspect of cyberbullying. Recent laws like \"right to explanations\" of General Data Protection Regulation, have spurred research in developing interpretable models rather than focusing on performance. Motivated by this we develop the first interpretable multi-task model called {\\em mExCB} for automatic cyberbullying detection from code-mixed languages which can simultaneously solve several tasks, cyberbullying detection, explanation/rationale identification, target group detection and sentiment analysis. We have introduced {\\em BullyExplain}, the first benchmark dataset for explainable cyberbullying detection in code-mixed language. Each post in {\\em BullyExplain} dataset is ann",

    "translated_abstract": "随着不同社交媒体网络和在线通讯应用的普及，网络霸凌已成为一个重大问题。尽管已经有很多关于单语言网络霸凌检测模型的研究，但在混合语言和可解释性方面的研究却很少。最近的《通用数据保护条例》等法律推动了以解释性模型为重点的研究，而不仅仅是性能。受此启发，我们开发了第一个可解释的多任务模型mExCB，用于从混合语言中自动检测网络霸凌，同时解决多个任务，包括网络霸凌检测、解释/理由识别、目标群体检测和情感分析。我们还引入了第一个用于解释性网络霸凌检测的基准数据集BullyExplain。BullyExplain数据集中的每个帖子都被注释了……",
