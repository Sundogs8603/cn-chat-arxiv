    "abstract": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a young, oil-rich country, where national youth display a clear preference for public sector employment. Growing youth unemployment reinforces the importance of non-government employment, including entrepreneurship. This study investigates UAE national youth intentions towards entrepreneurship through the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Entrepreneurial Intention Questionnaire (EIQ). Analysis (N=544) identifies the direct influence of attitude and perceived behavioral control, and indirect influence of subjective norms on entrepreneurship intention. Results also examine several demographic variables and highlight the potential importance of family and social groups in promoting entrepreneurial intentions in this emerging country context.",

    "translated_abstract": "阿联酋是一个年轻且富有的国家，国内青年明显更倾向于选择公共部门就业。不断增长的青年失业率强调非政府就业的重要性，包括创业。本研究通过计划行为理论和创业意愿问卷（EIQ）调查了阿联酋国内青年对创业的意愿。分析结果（N=544）表明态度和知觉行为控制直接影响创业意愿，而主观规范则间接影响创业意愿。研究结果还调查了几个人口统计变量，并突出了家庭和社会群体在促进这个新兴国家背景下创业意愿中的潜在重要性。",
