    "translated_abstract": "传统上，病理学分析和诊断是由专家在显微镜下通过观察玻璃切片标本进行手动眼球判断来完成的。全幻灯切片图像是从玻璃切片制作的数字标本。全幻灯切片图像使得标本能够在计算机屏幕上观察，并引发了计算病理学，其中利用计算机视觉和人工智能进行自动分析和诊断。借助当前的计算进展，整个全幻灯切片图像可以在没有人类监督的情况下进行自主分析。然而，如果全幻灯切片图像受到组织伪影（如组织褶皱或气泡）的影响，则分析可能会失败或导致错误的诊断，这取决于伪影的严重程度。现有的伪影检测方法依赖于专家对严重程度的评估，以消除受到伪影影响的区域进行分析。这个过程耗时、繁琐，并且有损于自动化分析或伪影去除的目标。",
