    "abstract": "Chemical reactivity models are developed to predict chemical reaction outcomes in the form of classification (success/failure) or regression (product yield) tasks. The vast majority of the reported models are trained solely on chemical information such as reactants, products, reagents, and solvents, but not on the details of a synthetic protocol. Herein incorporation of procedural text with the aim to augment the Graphormer reactivity model and improve its accuracy is presented. Two major approaches are used: training an adapter Graphormer model that is provided with a GPT-2-derived latent representation of the text procedure (ReacLLaMA-Adapter) and labeling an unlabeled part of a dataset with the LLaMA 2 model followed by training the Graphormer on an extended dataset (Zero-Shot Labeling ReacLLaMA). Both methodologies enhance the discernment of unpromising reactions, thereby providing more accurate models with improved specificity.",

    "translated_abstract": "化学反应模型被用来预测化学反应结果，形式可以是分类（成功/失败）或回归（产物收率）任务。绝大多数报道的模型仅使用化学信息，如反应物、产物、试剂和溶剂，而不使用合成步骤的细节。本文介绍了将步骤文本纳入Graphormer反应性模型以提高其准确性的方法。使用了两种主要方法：训练一个适配器Graphormer模型，该模型提供了一个基于GPT-2的文本步骤的潜在表示（ReacLLaMA-Adapter），以及使用LLaMA 2模型标记数据集中的一个未标记部分，然后在扩展数据集上训练Graphormer模型（Zero-Shot Labeling ReacLLaMA）。这两种方法都增强了对不太可能的反应的区分能力，从而提供了更准确的模型和更好的特异性。",
