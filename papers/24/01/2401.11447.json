How to enhance the adherence of patients to maximize the benefit of allergen immunotherapy (AIT) plays a crucial role in the management of AIT. This study aims to leverage novel machine learning models to precisely predict the risk of non-adherence of patients and related systematic symptom scores, to provide a novel approach in the management of long-term AIT.  Methods: The research develops and analyzes two models, Sequential Latent Actor-Critic (SLAC) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), evaluating them based on scoring and adherence prediction capabilities.
