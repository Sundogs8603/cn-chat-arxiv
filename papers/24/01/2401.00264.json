    "abstract": "This paper studies identification for a wide range of nonlinear panel data models, including binary choice, ordered repsonse, and other types of limited dependent variable models. Our approach accommodates dynamic models with any number of lagged dependent variables as well as other types of (potentially contemporary) endogeneity. Our identification strategy relies on a partial stationarity condition, which not only allows for an unknown distribution of errors but also for temporal dependencies in errors. We derive partial identification results under flexible model specifications and provide additional support conditions for point identification. We demonstrate the robust finite-sample performance of our approach using Monte Carlo simulations, and apply the approach to analyze the empirical application of income categories using various ordered choice models.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一系列非线性面板数据模型的识别问题，包括二元选择、有序反应以及其他类型的有限依赖变量模型。我们的方法适用于具有任意滞后依赖变量和其他类型（可能是同时期）内生性的动态模型。我们的识别策略基于部分稳定性条件，该条件不仅允许错误的未知分布，还允许错误的时间依赖性。我们在灵活的模型规范下得到了部分识别结果，并提供了额外的支持条件，以实现点识别。通过蒙特卡洛模拟，我们展示了我们的方法在有限样本下的鲁棒性能，并使用各种有序选择模型对收入类别的实证应用进行了分析。",
