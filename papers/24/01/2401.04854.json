    "translated_abstract": "LLMs（语言模型）是否像复印机或印刷机等文化技术一样，传输信息但无法创建新内容？我们将这个概念称为\"文献主义\"，它面临一个挑战，即LLMs经常生成全新的文本。我们首先为\"文献主义\"对抗这个挑战进行辩护，展示了新的文本仅在派生意义上具有意义，因此这些生成的文本的内容在重要意义上依赖于原始人类文本的内容。然后，我们提出了一个不同的、新颖的挑战，即LLMs生成\"新引用\"的例子，使用新的名称来引用新实体。如果LLMs不是文化技术而是具有有限形式的代理能力（信念、欲望和意图），这样的例子可以很好地解释。根据心灵哲学中的解释主义，仅当一个系统的行为可以通过假设它具有信念、欲望和意图来很好地解释时，它才具有这样的信念、欲望和意图。",
    "tldr": "本文探讨了语言模型（LLMs）是更像图书馆还是图书管理员的问题。论文首先阐述了 \"文献主义 \"这一概念，并提出了对其的挑战，指出LLMs生成的全新文本在内容上依赖于原始人类文本的内容。然后，论文提出了对 \"文献主义\"的新颖挑战，讨论了LLMs生成的 \"新引用\"问题。最后，根据心灵哲学中的解释主义，论文提出了有限代理能力的LLMs可能存在的可能性。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper explores the question of whether Language Models (LLMs) are more like libraries or librarians. It initially presents the concept of \"bibliotechnism\" and defends it against the challenge of LLMs generating novel text that is meaningful only in a derivative sense. Furthermore, it introduces the novel challenge of \"novel reference\" generated by LLMs and discusses the possibility of limited agency in LLMs based on interpretationism in the philosophy of mind."
