    "abstract": "We report results of a longitudinal sentiment classification of Reddit posts written by students of four major Canadian universities. We work with the texts of the posts, concentrating on the years 2020-2023. By finely tuning a sentiment threshold to a range of [-0.075,0.075], we successfully built classifiers proficient in categorizing post sentiments into positive and negative categories. Noticeably, our sentiment classification results are consistent across the four university data sets.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们报告了对四所加拿大主要大学的学生撰写的Reddit帖子进行纵向情感分类的结果。我们使用帖子的文本，重点关注2020年至2023年之间的时间。通过精细调整情感阈值在[-0.075, 0.075]范围内，我们成功构建了能够将帖子情感分类为积极和消极类别的分类器。值得注意的是，我们的情感分类结果在四个大学数据集中是一致的。",
