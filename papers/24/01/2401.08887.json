The challenge focuses on distant speaker diarization and automatic speech recognition (DASR) in far-field meeting scenarios, with single-channel and known-geometry multi-channel tracks, and serves as a launch platform for two new datasets: First, a benchmarking dataset of 315 meetings, averaging 6 minutes each, capturing a broad spectrum of real-world acoustic conditions and conversational dynamics. It is recorded across 30 conference rooms, featuring 4-8 attendees and a total of 35 unique speakers. Second, a 1000-hour simulated training dataset, synthesized with enhanced authenticity for real-world generalization, incorporating 15,000 real acoustic transfer functions. The tasks focus on single-device DASR, where multi-channel devices always share the same known geometry. This is aligned with common setups in actual conference rooms,",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了第一个自然办公室谈话者在远场音频记录环境中（“NOTSOFAR-1”）的挑战，包括数据集和基准系统。该挑战主要关注远场会议中的远距离发言人划分和自动语音识别（DASR），包括单声道和已知几何多通道的轨道，并且作为两个新数据集的发布平台：第一个数据集是一个基准测试数据集，包括315个会议，每个会议平均6分钟，捕捉到广泛的真实世界声学环境和对话动态。它是在30个会议室中录制的，每个会议室有4-8个与会者和共计35个不同的发言者。第二个数据集是一个1000小时的模拟训练数据集，具有增强的真实性以实现真实世界的泛化，包括15000个真实声学转移函数。任务集中在单设备DASR上，其中多通道设备始终共享相同已知的几何形状。这与实际会议室的常见设置是一致的。",
