    "abstract": "Recent advancements in language models have significantly enhanced performance in multiple speech-related tasks. Existing speech language models typically utilize task-dependent prompt tokens to unify various speech tasks in a single model.

In this work, we propose a novel decoder-only speech language model, SpeechComposer, that can unify common speech tasks by composing a fixed set of prompt tokens. Built upon four primary tasks -- speech synthesis, speech recognition, speech language modeling, and text language modeling -- SpeechComposer can easily extend to more speech tasks via compositions of well-designed prompt tokens, like voice conversion and speech enhancement. The unification of prompt tokens also makes it possible for knowledge sharing among different speech tasks in a more structured manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our",

    "translated_abstract": "最近语言模型的进展大大提升了多种语音相关任务的性能。现有的语音语言模型通常利用任务相关的提示标记将各种语音任务统一在一个模型中。然而，这种设计忽略了不同语音任务之间的内在联系，这可能会提高每个任务的性能。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的只解码器的语音语言模型SpeechComposer，它可以通过组合一组固定的提示标记统一常见的语音任务。SpeechComposer建立在四个主要任务的基础上--语音合成、语音识别、语音语言建模和文本语言建模--通过设计良好的提示标记的组合，如声音转换和语音增强，可以轻松扩展到更多的语音任务。提示标记的统一也使得不同语音任务之间的知识共享更加结构化。实验结果表明我们的模型提供了更好的性能和更大的灵活性。",
