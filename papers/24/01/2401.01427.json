    "translated_abstract": "针对全球气候危机，世界各国政府正在引入立法措施，以减少温室气体（GHG）排放，助力缓解环境灾难。一种促进减排的方法是激励碳捕获和碳减少项目，同时惩罚超额的GHG排放。投资于碳捕获项目或减少排放的公司可以获得抵消信用（OCs）作为回报。这些OCs可以用于合规期间抵消其超额排放的监管目的。OCs也可以在企业之间进行交易。因此，企业可以选择投资于项目来产生OCs，或者交易OCs。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新的市场框架，并在单参与者和双参与者情况下对GHG OC市场参与者的最佳行为进行了表征。我们分析了单期和多期的设定。由于市场模型没有闭合解，我们开发了数值方法来解决问题。",
