    "translated_abstract": "在因果建模领域，潜在结果和结构因果模型是主要的框架。然而，这些框架在实际建模反事实情况时面临着显著挑战，这些反事实情况形式化为潜在结果的联合分布参数。反事实推理在当代决策过程中具有重要的意义，特别是在需要基于$(Y(0),Y(1))$的联合值进行个性化激励的情景中。本文首先研究了潜在结果和结构因果模型的反事实建模框架。通过分析，我们发现了一种固有的模型容量限制，称为“退化的反事实问题”，这是这两个框架的基石一致性规则所导致的。为了解决这个限制，我们引入了一种新的“分布一致”假设，并根据这个假设提出了分布一致的结构因果模型（DiscoSCMs）。",
