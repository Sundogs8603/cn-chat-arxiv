    "translated_abstract": "人类大脑的皮层有许多凸起和沟槽，称为回状脑回和沟状脑沟。虽然主要皮层褶皱存在着高度个体间的一致性，但当我们检查具体的形状和折叠模式的细节时情况并非如此。由于这种复杂性，描述皮层折叠的变异性并将其与受试者的行为特征或病理学联系起来仍然是一个未解决的科学问题。传统的方法包括基于几何距离标记一些特定的模式，要么手动标记，要么半自动标记，但是现代深度学习技术与数以万计的受试者的MRI图像数据集的最近可用性使其特别具有吸引力。在这里，我们建立了一个自监督深度学习模型来检测扣带区域的折叠模式。我们使用基于拓扑的增强训练了一个对比自监督模型（SimCLR），使用了人体连通计划（1101个受试者）和UKBioBank（21070个受试者）数据集。",
