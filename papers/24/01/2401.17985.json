    "translated_abstract": "监测长寿灌木（如常见的杜松）的分布和大小结构可以用于估计气候变化对高山和高纬度生态系统的长期影响。历史航空超高分辨率影像提供了一种回顾性工具，可以高精度监测灌木的生长和分布。目前，深度学习模型在检测和描绘具有明确定义形状的对象的轮廓方面取得了令人印象深刻的结果。然而，将这些模型适应于检测表达复杂生长模式的自然对象（例如杜松）仍然是一项具有挑战性的任务。本研究提出了一种新方法，利用遥感RGB影像与基于Mask R-CNN的实例分割模型相结合，个别描绘西班牙内华达山脉林线上的杜松灌木。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种新的数据构造设计，其中使用的是光解译数据（PI）和实地调查数据（FW）分别进行操作。",
