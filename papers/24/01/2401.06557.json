    "translated_abstract": "从观测数据中估计个体治疗效应（ITE）是一个具有重要价值的关键研究领域。如何识别隐藏的混淆因素在ITE估计中是一个关键挑战。最近的研究已经将社交网络的结构信息纳入其中，取得了显著的进展。然而，这些方法利用图神经网络在欧几里得空间中学习隐藏混淆因素的表示，忽视了两个关键问题：（1）社交网络经常表现出无标度结构，而欧几里得嵌入在嵌入此类图时会产生高度失真，（2）社交网络中的每个自我中心网络都表现出与治疗相关的特征，意味着隐藏混淆因素的显著模式。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新的方法，名为Treatment-Aware Hyperbolic Representation Learning（TAHyper）。首先，TAHyper使用超螺旋空间进行嵌入学习，以捕捉社交网络的无标度特性，并利用治疗相关的特征来学习隐藏混淆因素的模式。",
