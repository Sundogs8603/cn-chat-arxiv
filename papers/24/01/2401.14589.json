    "translated_abstract": "背景：临床决策中的认知偏差显著导致诊断错误和次优患者结果。解决这些偏差问题在医疗领域面临巨大挑战。本研究通过利用大型语言模型（LLMs）在多智能体框架中减轻这些偏差的作用。我们通过多智能体对话模拟临床决策过程，并评估其对改善诊断准确性的有效性。方法：从文献中找到了总共16个已发表和未发表的病例报告，其中认知偏差导致误诊。在多智能体系统中，我们利用 GPT-4 Turbo 促进四个模拟智能体之间的交互，以复制临床团队动态。每个智能体都有独特的角色：1) 在考虑讨论后进行初步和最终诊断。2) 充当魔鬼的代言人，以纠正确认偏差和锚定偏差。3) 充当导师和促进者。",
