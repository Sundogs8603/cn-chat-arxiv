    "translated_abstract": "战术、技术和程序（TTPs）是网络安全领域中复杂的攻击模式，在文本知识库中有详细的描述。在网络安全写作中识别TTPs，通常称为TTP映射，是一个重要而具有挑战性的任务。传统的学习方法通常以经典的多类或多标签分类设置为目标。由于存在大量的类别（即TTPs），标签分布的不均衡和标签空间的复杂层次结构，这种设置限制了模型的学习能力。我们采用了一种不同的学习范式来解决这个问题，其中将文本与TTP标签之间的直接语义相似度决定为文本分配给TTP标签，从而减少了仅仅在大型标签空间上竞争的复杂性。为此，我们提出了一种具有有效的基于采样的学习比较机制的神经匹配架构，促进学习过程。",
