    "translated_abstract": "在工业生产中，滚动轴承寿命的预测非常重要。然而，高质量的滚动轴承全生命周期数据的稀缺性一直是精确预测的主要制约因素。为了解决这一挑战，本文引入了CVGAN模型，这是一个能够生成水平和垂直方向上的一维振动信号的新框架，其受历史振动数据和剩余寿命的条件约束。此外，我们提出了一种自回归生成方法，可以迭代地利用之前生成的振动信息来指导当前信号的生成。通过在PHM 2012数据集上进行的实验证明了CVGAN模型的有效性。我们的研究结果表明，CVGAN模型在自回归和非自回归生成模式下，在MMD和FID指标方面表现优于许多高级方法。值得注意的是，训练使用了由CVGAN模型生成的全生命周期数据。",
