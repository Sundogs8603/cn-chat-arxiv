Additionally, there is an even larger gap in evaluating the advanced knowledge and reasoning abilities of LMMs in non-English contexts such as Chinese. We introduce CMMMU, a new Chinese Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs on tasks demanding college-level subject knowledge and deliberate reasoning in a Chinese context. CMMMU is inspired by and strictly follows the annotation and analysis pattern of MMMU.   CMMMU includes 12k manually collected multimodal questions from college exams, quizzes, and textbooks, covering six core disciplines: Art & Design, Business, Science, Health & Medicine, Humanities & Social Science, and Tech & Engineering, like its companion, MMMU. These questions span 30 subjects and comprise 39 highly heterogeneous image ",

    "translated_abstract": "随着大型多模型模型(LMMs)的能力不断提升，评估LMMs的表现日益成为一个迫切的需求。此外，在评估LMMs在中文等非英语环境中先进知识和推理能力方面存在更大差距。我们引入了CMMMU，一个新的中文大规模多学科多模态理解基准，旨在评估LMMs在需要大学水平学科知识和深思熟虑推理的任务中的表现。CMMMU受到了MMMUs的标注和分析模式的启发并严格遵循。CMMMU包括来自大学考试、测验和教科书的1.2万个手动收集的多模态问题，涵盖六个核心学科：艺术与设计、商业、科学、健康与医学、人文社科以及技术与工程，就像其伙伴MMMMU一样。这些问题涵盖30个学科，包括39个高度异质的图像。",
