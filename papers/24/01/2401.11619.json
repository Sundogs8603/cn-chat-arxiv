We characterize when a multi-curve interest rate model is consistent with a given parameterized family of forward curves and spreads and when a model can be realized by a finite-dimensional state process. We illustrate the general theory in a number of model classes and examples, providing explicit constructions of finite-dimensional realizations. Based on these theoretical results, we perform the calibration of a three-curve Hull-White model to market data and analyse the stability of the estimated parameters.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了Heath-Jarrow-Morton类型的多曲线利率模型在一致性和有限维实现存在性方面的问题，推广了T. Björk和合著者在经典单曲线设置中开发的几何方法。我们刻画了多曲线利率模型与给定参数化的前瞻曲线和价格差的一致性，并判断一个模型是否可以通过有限维状态过程来实现。我们通过一些模型类和示例来说明这个通用理论，并提供了有限维实现的显式构造。基于这些理论结果，我们将三曲线Hull-White模型与市场数据进行校准，并分析所估计参数的稳定性。",
