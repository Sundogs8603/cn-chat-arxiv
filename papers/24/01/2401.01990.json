    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了引导正样本采样自监督学习（GPS-SSL），这是一种将先验知识注入到自监督学习（SSL）正样本选择的通用方法。当前的SSL方法利用数据增强（DA）生成正样本，并将先验知识结合进去，但是错误或者过弱的DA会严重降低所学到的表示的质量。GPS-SSL则提出设计一个度量空间，使得欧氏距离成为语义关系的有意义的替代。在这个空间中，可以通过最近邻采样生成正样本。任何先验知识都可以独立地嵌入到这个度量空间中，而不受所使用的DA影响。由于其简单性，GPS-SSL适用于任何SSL方法，如SimCLR或BYOL。GPS-SSL的一个关键好处是减少了定制强DA的压力。例如，GPS-SSL在Cifar10上使用弱DA达到了85.58％，而基准值只达到了37.51％。",
