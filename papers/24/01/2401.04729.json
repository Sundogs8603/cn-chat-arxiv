    "abstract": "The constantly increasing capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) open new possibilities for human-AI collaboration. One promising approach to leverage existing complementary capabilities is allowing humans to delegate individual instances to the AI. However, enabling humans to delegate instances effectively requires them to assess both their own and the AI's capabilities in the context of the given task. In this work, we explore the effects of providing contextual information on human decisions to delegate instances to an AI. We find that providing participants with contextual information significantly improves the human-AI team performance. Additionally, we show that the delegation behavior changes significantly when participants receive varying types of contextual information. Overall, this research advances the understanding of human-AI interaction in human delegation and provides actionable insights for designing more effective collaborative systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能的不断增强能力为人工智能与人类的协作带来了新的可能性。利用现有的互补能力，让人们将个别实例委托给人工智能是一种有前景的方法。然而，使人们有效地委托实例需要他们评估自己和人工智能在给定任务的背景下的能力。在这项工作中，我们探讨了在人类决定将实例委托给人工智能时提供上下文信息的效果。我们发现，提供上下文信息显著提高了人工智能与人类团队的表现。此外，我们还表明，当参与者接收到不同类型的上下文信息时，委托行为会发生显著变化。总体而言，这项研究推进了人工智能委托中人工智能与人类互动的理解，并为设计更有效的协作系统提供了可行的见解。",
