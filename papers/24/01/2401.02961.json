    "translated_abstract": "元表面在第五代（5G）微波通信中有广泛应用。在元表面家族中，与常规形状相比，自由形态元表面在实现复杂的光谱响应方面表现出色。然而，传统的自由形态元表面数值方法耗时且需要专业知识。最近的研究表明，深度学习对于加速和优化元表面设计具有巨大潜力。在这里，我们提出了XGAN，一种带有代理的扩展生成对抗网络（GAN），用于高质量的自由形态元表面设计。所提出的代理为XGAN提供物理约束，以便XGAN能够准确地从输入的光谱响应中生成元表面。在涉及20000个自由形态元表面设计的比较实验中，XGAN实现了0.9734的平均准确度，并且比传统方法快500倍。这种方法有助于元表面库的建立。",
