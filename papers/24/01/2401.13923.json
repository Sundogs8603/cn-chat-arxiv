    "translated_abstract": "语言模型（LMs）在各个领域有着很大的影响。然而，它们对于理解3D分子结构的固有限制极大地限制了它们在生物分子领域的潜力。为了弥补这一差距，我们关注于3D分子-文本解释，并提出3D-MoLM：3D分子语言模型。具体而言，3D-MoLM通过为LM配备一个3D分子编码器，使得LM能够解释和分析3D分子。这种集成是通过一个3D分子-文本投影器实现的，它连接了3D分子编码器的表示空间和LM的输入空间。此外，为了增强3D-MoLM在跨模态分子理解和指令跟随方面的能力，我们精心策划了一个以3D分子为中心的指引调整数据集--3D-MoIT。通过3D分子-文本对齐和3D分子中心的指引调整，3D-MoLM建立了3D分子编码器和LM的集成。它在下游任务上显著超过了现有的基线。",
