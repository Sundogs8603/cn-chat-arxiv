    "translated_abstract": "配对比较模型被用于各个领域的实用性和排名评估。现代问题规模的增加强调了对于当被比较对象数量无限增加时，对于这些模型中的统计推断的理解的需求。目前，文献中对于这些模型中的统计推断的理解还相当有限，除非只是在少数特殊实例中。本文通过在广泛的配对比较模型中建立极大似然估计量的渐近正态性结果来填补这一空白。关键思想在于将费舍尔信息矩阵识别为加权图拉普拉斯矩阵，通过一种细致入微的谱分析方法来进行研究。我们的发现为在各种配对比较模型中进行统计推断提供了第一个统一的方法，超越了Bradley-Terry模型，为实践者提供了坚实的理论保证。通过利用合成数据进行的模拟验证这一渐近正态性结果，然后进行了",
