    "abstract": "Broadband infrastructure owners do not always know how their customers are connected in the local networks, which are structured as rooted trees. A recent study is able to infer the topology of a local network using discrete time series data from the leaves of the tree (customers). In this study we propose a contrastive approach for learning a binary event encoder from continuous time series data. As a preliminary result, we show that our approach has some potential in learning a valuable encoder.",
