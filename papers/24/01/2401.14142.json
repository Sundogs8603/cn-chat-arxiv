    "translated_abstract": "现有方法，如概念瓶颈模型 (CBM)，在为黑盒深度学习模型提供基于概念的解释方面取得了成功。它们通常通过在给定输入的情况下预测概念，然后在给定预测的概念的情况下预测最终的类别标签。然而，它们经常无法捕捉到概念之间的高阶非线性相互作用，例如纠正一个预测的概念（例如“黄色胸部”）无法帮助纠正高度相关的概念（例如“黄色腹部”），导致最终准确率不理想；它们无法自然地量化不同概念和类别标签之间的复杂条件依赖关系（例如对于一个带有类别标签“Kentucky Warbler”和概念“黑色嘴巴”的图像，模型能够正确预测另一个概念“黑色冠”的概率是多少），因此无法提供关于黑盒模型工作原理更深层次的洞察。针对这些限制，我们提出了基于能量的概念瓶颈模型（Energy-based Concept Bottleneck Models）。",
