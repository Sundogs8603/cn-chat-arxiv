    "translated_abstract": "云层的存在严重影响了光学遥感（RS）图像的质量和效果。然而，现有的基于深度学习（DL）的云去除（CR）技术在准确重建图像的视觉真实性和详细语义内容方面遇到了困难。为了应对这一挑战，本研究提出了在数据和方法上进行改进的方案。在数据方面，建立了一个名为CUHK Cloud Removal (CUHK-CR) 的0.5m空间分辨率的超高分辨率基准并加入了丰富的细节纹理和多样化的云覆盖，为设计和评估CR模型提供了可靠的基础。从方法的角度出发，提出了一种称为Diffusion Enhancement（DE）的基于扩散的CR框架，用于进行渐进纹理细节恢复，以减轻训练难度并提高推理准确性。此外，还提出了一种权重分配（WA）网络。",
