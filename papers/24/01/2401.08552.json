    "abstract": "Explaining multivariate time series is a compound challenge, as it requires identifying important locations in the time series and matching complex temporal patterns. Although previous saliency-based methods addressed the challenges, their perturbation may not alleviate the distribution shift issue, which is inevitable especially in heterogeneous samples.

Furthermore, we incorporate sample-specific sparse gates to generate more binary-skewed and smooth masks, which easily integrate temporal trends and select the salient features parsimoniously. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that ContraLSP outperforms state-of-the-art models, demonstrating a substantial improvement in explanation quality for time series data.

    "translated_abstract": "解释多元时间序列是一个复合挑战，因为它需要识别时间序列中的重要位置并匹配复杂的时间模式。虽然之前基于显著性的方法解决了这些挑战，但它们的扰动可能无法减轻分布偏移问题，尤其是在异质样本中。我们提出了ContraLSP，这是一个局部稀疏模型，引入对立样本来构建无信息的扰动，但使用对比学习保持分布。此外，我们还结合了样本特定的稀疏门，生成更多二进制偏斜和平滑的遮罩，可以轻松综合时间趋势并简洁地选择显著特征。对合成数据集和真实世界数据集的实证研究表明，ContraLSP优于现有模型，在解释时间序列数据的质量上取得了实质性的改进。源代码可在\\url{https://github.com/zichuan-liu/ContraL}找到。",
