    "translated_abstract": "高介电常数的材料在外部电场下容易极化，在许多现代电子设备中发挥着重要的功能。它们的实际效用由两个相互冲突的特性决定：高介电常数往往出现在带隙较窄的材料中，限制了介电击穿之前的工作电压。我们提出了一个高通量的工作流程，将元素替代、机器学习预筛选、从头计算模拟和人类专家直觉相结合，以有效地探索未知材料的潜在介电性能，从而合成和表征两种新型的介电材料CsTaTeO6和Bi2Zr2O7。我们的关键思想是在凸面帕累托前沿的多目标优化环境中应用机器学习。虽然通常被认为比单目标优化更具挑战性，但我们提出并展示了初步证据表明带隙和介电常数之间的1/x相关性实际上使任务变      得容易。",
