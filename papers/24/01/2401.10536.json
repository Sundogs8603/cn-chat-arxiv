    "translated_abstract": "Swin-Transformer在计算机视觉领域取得了显著的成功，利用其基于Transformer的层次化特征表示。在语音信号中，情感信息在不同尺度的语音特征上分布，例如词语、短语和话语。在此启发下，本文提出了一种利用平移窗口对多尺度情感特征进行聚合的层次化语音Transformer，用于语音情感识别（SER），称为Speech Swin-Transformer。具体而言，我们首先将语音频谱图在时域分割为段级补丁，由多个帧补丁组成。然后，使用一系列Swin块对这些段级补丁进行编码，其中利用本地窗口Transformer来探索每个段级补丁中帧补丁之间的本地帧间情感信息。之后，我们还设计了一个平移窗口Transformer，以补偿靠近段级补丁边界的补丁相关性。最后，我们通过实验证明了Speech Swin-Transformer在语音情感识别中的有效性。",
