    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习中，数据的指数增长及相关联的“维度灾难”给我们带来了巨大的挑战，特别是对于广泛而稀疏的数据集。为了应对这些挑战，多视图集成学习（MEL）作为一种创新方法出现，特征分区（FP）在构建MEL的人工视图中发挥着关键作用。我们的研究引入了一种基于信息论的全新方法——保持语义一致的特征分区（SPFP）算法。SPFP算法将数据集有效地分区为多个语义一致的视图，增强了MEL过程。通过对八个真实世界数据集进行广泛实验，从高维空间有限样本到低维空间大样本，我们的方法展示了显著的有效性。在高泛化性能可达的场景下，它保持了模型的准确性，同时显著改进了不确定性度量。相反，它保留了未变化的特征。",
