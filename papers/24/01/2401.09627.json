    "translated_abstract": "椎间盘疾病是一种常见病症，经常导致间歇性或持续性的腰背疼痛，对该疾病的诊断和评估依赖于腰椎MR图像中椎骨和椎间盘几何形状的准确测量。深度神经网络（DNN）模型可以帮助临床医生以更高效的方式自动化地对腰椎的个体实例（椎骨和椎间盘）进行图像分割，这被称为实例图像分割。在这项工作中，我们提出了SymTC，一种创新的腰椎MR图像分割模型，它结合了Transformer和卷积神经网络（CNN）的优势。具体而言，我们设计了一个并行的双路径架构来融合CNN层和Transformer层，并在Transformer的自注意力模块中集成了一种新颖的位置嵌入，增强了位置信息的利用以实现更准确的分割。为了进一步提高模型的性能，我们引入了一个新的定位系统进行模型优化。",
