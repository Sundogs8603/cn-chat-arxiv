    "abstract": "3D human body shape and pose estimation from RGB images is a challenging problem with potential applications in augmented/virtual reality, healthcare and fitness technology and virtual retail. Recent solutions have focused on three types of inputs: i) single images, ii) multi-view images and iii) videos. In this study, we surveyed and compared 3D body shape and pose estimation methods for contemporary dance and performing arts, with a special focus on human body pose and dressing, camera viewpoint, illumination conditions and background conditions. We demonstrated that multi-frame methods, such as PHALP, provide better results than single-frame method for pose estimation when dancers are performing contemporary dances.",
