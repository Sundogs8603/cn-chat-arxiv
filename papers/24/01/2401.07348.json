    "translated_abstract": "生成式人工智能的出现，特别是通过大型语言模型（LLMs）如ChatGPT及其后继模型，标志着人工智能领域的一次范式转变。先进的LLMs表现出多模态性，能处理多样化的数据格式，从而拓宽了它们的应用范围。然而，这些模型的复杂性和新兴自治性引入了预测性和法律遵从性方面的挑战。本文深入探讨了生成式人工智能和LLMs在欧盟背景下的法律和监管影响，分析了责任、隐私、知识产权和网络安全等方面。它批判性地审视了现有和拟议的欧盟立法（包括《人工智能法》草案）在应对生成式人工智能普遍和LLMs特别挑战方面的充分性。本文确定了立法框架中的潜在差距和不足，并提出建议以确保",
