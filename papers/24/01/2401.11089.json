    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）作为一种在推荐系统中通过本地训练模型来保护数据隐私的有希望的方法已经出现。最近，图神经网络（GNN）因其捕捉用户和项目之间高阶交互的能力而在推荐任务中受到了广泛关注。然而，隐私问题阻碍了整个用户-项目图的全局共享。为了解决这个限制，一些方法在图中创建了伪交互项或用户，以弥补每个客户端缺失信息。不幸的是，这些方法引入了随机噪声并引发隐私问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的联邦推荐系统FedRKG，在服务器上使用公开的项目信息构建和维护全局知识图（KG），从而实现更高阶的用户-项目交互。在客户端，一个关系感知的GNN模型利用多样的KG关系。为了保护本地交互项目和模糊梯度",
