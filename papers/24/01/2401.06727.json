    "translated_abstract": "通过在低维空间中表示图数据，来为后续任务提供属性图嵌入是这篇论文的目的。大多数现有的神经网络方法通过最小化重构误差来学习潜在表示。很少有研究同时考虑数据分布和潜在代码的拓扑结构，这通常导致在真实世界的图数据中表现较差。本文提出了一种新颖的深度流形(Variational)图自编码器(DMVGAE/DMGAE)方法，用于改善学习表示的稳定性和质量，以应对拥挤问题。在预定义的分布下，原始空间和潜在空间之间保持节点到节点的测地线相似性。所提出的方法在不同的流行数据集上，在不同的下游任务上显著超过了最先进的基准算法，验证了我们的解决方案。我们承诺在稿件接受后发布代码。",
