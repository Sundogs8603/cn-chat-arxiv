For example, the ability to perform under pressure during matches distinguishes the elite from the average. Appropriate pressure metric enables teams to assess players' performance accurately under pressure and design targeted training scenarios to address their weaknesses. The primary objective of this paper is to leverage both tracking and event data and game footage to capture the pressure experienced by the possession team in a soccer game scene. We propose a player pressure map to represent a given game scene, which lowers the dimension of raw data and still contains rich contextual information. Not only does it serve as an effective tool for visualizing and evaluating the pressure on the team and each individual, but it can also be utilized as a backbone for accessing players' performance.

    "translated_abstract": "在足球中，上下文的球员表现度量对教练们非常宝贵。例如，能够在比赛中承受压力的能力将精英和普通球员区分开来。正确的压力度量可以使球队准确评估球员在压力下的表现，并设计针对性的训练场景来弥补他们的弱点。本文的主要目标是利用追踪和事件数据以及比赛录像来捕捉足球比赛场景中球控球队所经历的压力。我们提出了一种球员压力地图来表示给定的比赛场景，它降低了原始数据的维度，同时仍包含丰富的上下文信息。它不仅作为一种有效的工具用于可视化和评估球队和每个个体面临的压力，还可以作为访问球员表现的基础。总的来说，我们的模型为教练和分析人员提供了更深入的理解。",
