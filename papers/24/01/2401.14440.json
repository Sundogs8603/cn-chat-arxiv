    "translated_abstract": "最近对基于transformer的自然语言理解（NLU）模型的新能力进行的研究表明，它们具备对词汇和组合语义的理解。然而，我们提供了证据表明这些说法应该持保留态度：我们发现目前最先进的自然语言推理（NLI）模型对微小的保留语义的表面形式变化敏感，这导致推断过程中出现大量不一致的模型决策。值得注意的是，这种行为与对组合语义的有效和深入理解不同，而在标准基准测试中评估模型准确度或探究句法、单调性和逻辑鲁棒性推理时均不会出现。我们提出了一个新颖的框架来衡量语义敏感性的程度。为此，我们使用含有微小保留语义的表面形式输入噪声的对抗生成样例来评估NLI模型。",
