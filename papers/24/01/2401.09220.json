    "translated_abstract": "现有的从表单式文档中提取视觉信息(VIE)的方法通常将该过程分割为独立的子任务，例如关键信息提取、键值对提取和选择群提取。然而，这些方法常常忽视了表单文档的层次结构，包括层次键值对和层次选择群。为了解决这些限制，我们提出了一种新的视角，将VIE重新构建为一个关系预测问题，并将不同任务的标签统一到一个单一的标签空间中。这种统一的方法允许定义各种关系类型，并有效地处理表单式文档中的层次关系。根据这个观点，我们介绍了UniVIE，它是一个全面解决VIE问题的统一模型。UniVIE使用一个由粗到细的策略进行操作。它首先通过一个树提案网络生成树提案，然后将其细化为层次树。",
