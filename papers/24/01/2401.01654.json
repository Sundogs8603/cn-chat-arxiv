    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，深度学习在基于多参数MRI的视觉途径分割中具有潜力。然而，获取用于训练的标注数据是费时费力的。因此，在有限标注样本的情况下，开发有效的算法至关重要。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种自我集成的标签高效深度学习方法（LESEN）。LESEN结合了有监督和无监督的损失，使得学生模型和教师模型可以互相学习，形成自我集成的均值教师框架。另外，我们引入了可靠的未标注样本选择（RUSS）机制，进一步提高了LESEN的效果。我们在人类连接组计划（HCP）数据集上的实验证明了我们的方法相对于现有技术的卓越性能，推动了临床和研究环境中的多模态VP分割的综合分析。实现代码将在以下链接处提供。",
