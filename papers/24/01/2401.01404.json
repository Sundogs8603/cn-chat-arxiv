    "translated_abstract": "网络重建是指在只有关于条件偶联的观测数据，例如时间序列或图模型的独立样本的情况下，确定N个节点之间未观测到的成对耦合。针对这个问题提出的算法的可扩展性的主要障碍是似乎无法避免的二次复杂度O(N^2)，即要考虑每种可能的成对耦合至少一次，尽管大多数感兴趣的网络都是稀疏的，非零耦合的数量只有O(N)。在这里，我们提出了一个适用于广泛重建问题的通用算法，其在子二次时间内实现结果，其数据相关复杂度宽松上界为O(N^(3/2)logN)，但具有更典型的对数线性复杂度O(Nlog^2 N)。我们的算法依赖于一个随机的二阶邻居搜索，产生了最佳的边候选。",
