    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型在生成建模方面取得了显著的成功。本文提出了一种名为PADS（通过扩散合成进行姿势分析）的新框架，旨在通过一个统一的流程解决3D人体姿势分析中的各种挑战。PADS的核心是两个独特的策略：i）使用扩散合成过程学习一个任务无关的姿势先验，从而有效地捕捉人体姿势数据中的运动约束；ii）将估计、补全、去噪等多个姿势分析任务统一为逆问题的实例。学习到的姿势先验将被视为对任务特定约束的正则化，通过一系列条件去噪步骤引导优化过程。PADS代表了首个基于扩散的框架，用于解决逆问题框架内的通用3D人体姿势分析。其性能已在不同基准测试上得到了验证，显示出其适应性和鲁棒性。",
