    "translated_abstract": "半自磨磨机在矿物处理厂的磨矿回路中起着至关重要的作用。准确预测半自磨磨机的产量是一个关键性能指标。尽管以前的研究中已经开发出了经验模型来预测半自磨磨机的产量，但是应用机器学习技术来做此预测的潜力仍未得到充分发挥。与依赖昂贵且耗时的实验数据的经验建模不同，机器学习技术可以利用在正常运行期间收集的数据。遗传编程（Genetic Programming，GP）是一种机器学习技术，其优势在于能够提供一个透明的方程式来精确预测磨机的产量。本研究探讨了将GP应用于预测半自磨磨机产量，并引入了五种新的GP变种来提高预测性能。这些变种提取了多个方程式，每个方程式可以准确预测特定训练数据群集的产量。",
