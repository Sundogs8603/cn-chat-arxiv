    "translated_abstract": "每个艺术家都有自己的创作过程，从先前的艺术家和作品中汲取灵感。如今，生成音乐模型已经自动化了这种“灵感”。然而，这些模型的黑匣子性质使得其创作输出的影响力来源无法被清楚地辨认。因此，用户可能会不经意地盗用、滥用或复制现有艺术家的作品。我们建立了一个可复制的方法来系统地识别音乐音频中相似的作品，以便了解训练数据的归因。我们方法的关键之一是利用有效的音乐音频相似度度量。我们将应用CLMR和CLAP嵌入到相似度测量中，并比较其效果，这些嵌入用于训练VampNet，一个最近的开源生成音乐模型中的500万个音频片段。我们通过人类听觉研究验证了这种方法。我们还探讨了对音频示例进行修改（如音高变化、时间拉伸、背景噪音）对相似度的影响。",
