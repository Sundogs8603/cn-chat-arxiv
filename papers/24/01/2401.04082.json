    "abstract": "Protein design often begins with knowledge of a desired function from a motif which motif-scaffolding aims to construct a functional protein around. Recently, generative models have achieved breakthrough success in designing scaffolds for a diverse range of motifs. However, the generated scaffolds tend to lack structural diversity, which can hinder success in wet-lab validation. In this work, we extend FrameFlow, an SE(3) flow matching model for protein backbone generation, to perform motif-scaffolding with two complementary approaches. The first is motif amortization, in which FrameFlow is trained with the motif as input using a data augmentation strategy. The second is motif guidance, which performs scaffolding using an estimate of the conditional score from FrameFlow, and requires no additional training. Both approaches achieve an equivalent or higher success rate than previous state-of-the-art methods, with 2.5 times more structurally diverse scaffolds. Code: https://github.com/ mi",

    "translated_abstract": "蛋白质设计通常从一个图案的期望功能开始，图案支架旨在构建一个功能性蛋白质。最近，生成模型在设计各种图案的支架方面取得了突破性的成功。然而，生成的支架往往缺乏结构多样性，这可能会影响湿实验验证的成功。在这项工作中，我们将FrameFlow，一种用于蛋白质主链生成的SE(3)流匹配模型扩展到使用两种互补的方法进行图案支架。第一种方法是图案摊销，即使用数据增强策略，将FrameFlow训练为以图案为输入。第二种方法是图案引导，它使用FrameFlow的条件分数估计进行支架构建，并且不需要额外的训练。这两种方法的成功率与之前的最先进方法相当或更高，并且可以产生结构上多样性更高2.5倍的支架。",
