    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了通用领域的大型语言模型，如GPT-4 Turbo，能否使用手术的描述和来自电子健康记录的患者临床记录，进行风险分层和预测术后结果指标。我们对8个不同任务的预测性能进行了考察：ASA生理状态分类的预测、住院、重症监护室入院、非计划入院、住院死亡、PACU第一阶段持续时间、住院时间和重症监护室时间的预测。少量样本和链式启发式策略改善了几个任务的预测性能。我们在ASA生理状态分类预测上达到了0.50的F1得分，在重症监护室入院预测上达到了0.81的F1得分，在住院死亡预测上达到了0.86的F1得分。所有提示策略在持续时间预测任务上的表现普遍较差。当前一代大型语言模型可以帮助临床医生在分类任务中进行术中风险分层，并生成高质量的自然语言总结。",
