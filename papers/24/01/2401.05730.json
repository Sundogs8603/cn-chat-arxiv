    "translated_abstract": "在过去几年里，对比学习在视觉无监督表示学习的成功中起着核心作用。与此同时，高性能的非对比学习方法也得到了发展。虽然大部分工作仅利用了两个视图，我们仔细审查了现有的多视图方法，并提出了一种通用的多视图策略，可以提高任何对比或非对比方法的学习速度和性能。我们首先分析了CMC的全图范式，并经验性地表明，在小学习率和早期训练时，K个视图的学习速度可以增加$K$-$views$倍。然后，我们通过混合仅裁剪增强创建的视图，采用SwAV多裁剪中的小尺寸视图，并修改负采样来升级CMC的全图。产生的多视图策略被称为ECPP（高效组合正样本配对）。通过将ECPP应用于SimCLR和一个样本效果验证其有效性。",
