    "translated_abstract": "随着网络安全威胁不断增加，不法分子每天注册数千个新域名进行垃圾邮件、网络钓鱼和驱动下载等互联网攻击，强调了创新检测方法的需求。本文介绍了一种先进的方法，用于在注册过程开始时识别可疑域名。附带的数据流程通过比较新域名与注册域名产生关键特征，强调了关键相似度得分。利用自然语言处理（NLP）技术的新颖组合，包括预训练的Canine模型和多层感知器（MLP）模型，我们的系统分析语义和数值属性，为早期威胁检测提供了强大的解决方案。该综合方法显著减少了漏洞窗口，加强了对潜在威胁的防御。研究结果证明了该综合方法的有效性，并为开发主动预防性操作的努力做出了贡献。",
