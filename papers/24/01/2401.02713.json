Learning graph-level representation plays an important role in a variety of real-world issues such as molecule property prediction, protein structure feature extraction, and social network analysis. The mainstream method is utilizing contrastive learning to facilitate graph feature extraction, known as Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL). GCL, although effective, suffers from some complications in contrastive learning, such as the effect of false negative pairs.

    "translated_abstract": "本文关注以非监督方式在整个图级别上学习表示。学习图级表示在诸如分子属性预测、蛋白质结构特征提取和社交网络分析等各种实际问题中起着重要作用。主流方法是利用对比学习促进图特征提取，称为图对比学习（GCL）。尽管GCL有效，但在对比学习中存在一些复杂问题，比如虚假负样本对的影响。此外，GCL中的数据增强策略对不同的图数据集适应性较弱。受到这些问题的启发，我们提出了一种新的框架，称为结构知识提炼（SKR），它利用数据结构确定一对样本是正样本还是负样本的概率。同时，我们提出了一种增强策略，能够自然地保留原始数据的语义含义，并且与我们的SKR框架兼容。",
