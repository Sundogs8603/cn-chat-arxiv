    "translated_abstract": "近年来，自然语言处理（NLP）技术的进步改变了无障碍和独占性测试领域，特别是对于视力障碍学生（VIS）。计算机化测试（CBT）在过去的几年中已经显示出了在电子化考试方面的重要性，使考试过程更加简便，提供更快更准确的结果，并为考生提供更大的灵活性和可访问性。然而，视力障碍学生无法访问印刷文件，因此本文提出了一种面向视力障碍学生的基于NLP的计算机化测试指南。该系统采用语音技术预先训练的方法，为视力障碍学生实时提供支持和帮助。系统利用NLP技术将基于文本的问题和相关选项转化为机器可读的格式。随后，语音技术预先训练的模型处理转化后的文本，实现对视力障碍学生的支持。",
