    "translated_abstract": "尽管多视图无监督特征选择（MUFS）是一种在机器学习中降维的有效技术，但现有方法无法直接处理存在不完整多视图数据的情况，其中某些视图中会有一些样本丢失。这些方法应首先对缺失的数据应用预定值进行填补，然后在完整的数据集上进行特征选择。将补全和特征选择过程分离无法充分利用潜在的协同作用，即通过特征选择获得的局部结构信息可以引导补全过程，从而进一步改善特征选择性能。此外，先前的方法仅关注于利用样本的局部结构信息，而忽视了特征空间的固有局部性质。为了解决这些问题，提出了一种新的MUFS方法，称为统一视图补全和特征选择学习（UNIFIER）。",
