Opioid use disorder is known to be under-coded as a diagnosis, yet problematic opioid use can be documented in clinical notes.  Objectives: Our goals were 1) to identify problematic opioid use from a full range of clinical notes; and 2) to compare the characteristics of patients identified as having problematic opioid use, exclusively documented in clinical notes, to those having documented ICD opioid use disorder diagnostic codes.  Materials and Methods: We developed and applied a natural language processing (NLP) tool to the clinical notes of a patient cohort (n=222,371) from two Veteran Affairs service regions to identify patients with problematic opioid use. We also used a set of ICD diagnostic codes to identify patients with opioid use disorder from the same cohort. We compared the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients identified only through NLP, to those of patients identified thro",
