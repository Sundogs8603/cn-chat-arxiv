    "translated_abstract": "分子对接是构建基于结构的药物设计的重要工具，可以加快药物开发的效率。蛋白质和小分子之间的复杂和动态结合过程需要在广泛的空间范围内进行搜索和采样。传统的对接方法通过搜索可能的结合位点和构象来实现，计算复杂度高，在盲目对接中效果不佳。受到这一点的启发，我们通过将量子启发算法与通过深度学习在编码的分子空间中学习的梯度相结合，实现了在盲目对接中的改进。数值仿真结果表明，我们的方法在传统的对接算法和基于深度学习的算法上表现出了超过10%的提升。与目前最先进的基于深度学习的对接算法DiffDock相比，Top-1（RMSD<2）的成功率从33%提高到35%。",
