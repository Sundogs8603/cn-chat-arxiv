    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的识别策略，依赖于准工具变量（准IVs）。准IV是一个相关但可能无效的IV，因为它并非完全外生和/或被排除在外。我们展示了在两个互补的准IV共同相关的条件下，可以识别一系列具有离散或连续内生处理的模型。这些模型通常通过IV实现识别，例如具有秩不变性的分位数模型，具有齐次处理效应的加法模型和局部平均处理效应模型。为了实现识别，我们将一个被排除但可能是内生的准IV（例如“相关代理”，如先前的处理选择）与一个外生的（在被排除的准IV条件下）但可能被包含的准IV（例如随机分配或外生市场冲击）结合起来。在实践中，我们的识别策略应该更具吸引力，因为互补准IV比标准IV更容易找到。我们的方法还具有……",

Complementary quasi-IVs are used, which can be easier to find compared to traditional instrumental variables. Identification is achieved by combining one excluded but possibly endogenous quasi-IV with one exogenous but potentially included quasi-IV. This approach is widely applicable to models with discrete or continuous endogenous treatments."
