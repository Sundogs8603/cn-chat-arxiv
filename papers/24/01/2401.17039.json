Despite their importance, even skilful models struggle with producing or interpreting such repair acts. In this work, we test three hypotheses concerning the effects of action taking as an auxiliary task in modelling iCR policies. Contrary to initial expectations, we conclude that its contribution to learning an iCR policy is limited, but some information can still be extracted from prediction uncertainty. We present further evidence that even well-motivated, Transformer-based models fail to learn good policies for when to ask Instruction CRs (iCRs), while the task of determining what to ask about can be more successfully modelled. Considering the implications of these findings, we further discuss the shortcomings of the data-driven paradigm for learning meta-communication acts.",

    "translated_abstract": "澄清请求是解决指示遵循互动中的沟通问题（例如由于歧义或模糊不清）的一种机制。尽管它们很重要，但即使是熟练的模型也难以产生或解释这种修复行为。在这项工作中，我们测试了关于将动作作为辅助任务在建模iCR策略中的影响的三个假设。与最初的预期相反，我们得出结论，其对学习iCR策略的贡献有限，但仍然可以从预测的不确定性中提取一些信息。我们进一步提供证据，即即使是动机充分的基于Transformer的模型也无法学习到什么时候提问指示CR的良好策略，而决定何时提问可以更成功地进行建模。考虑到这些发现的影响，我们进一步讨论了基于数据驱动范式学习元通信行为的缺点。",
