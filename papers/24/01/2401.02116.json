    "translated_abstract": "高维向量相似性搜索(HVSS)作为数据科学和人工智能应用的强大工具，正受到关注。随着向量数据的增长，内存索引变得非常昂贵，因为它们需要大量扩展主内存资源。一种可能的解决方案是使用基于磁盘的实现，将向量数据存储和搜索在高性能设备(如NVMe SSD)中。然而，对于数据片段的HVSS仍然是向量数据库中的挑战，其中一个机器有多个片段来实现系统功能（如扩展）。在这种情况下，每个片段的内存和磁盘空间有限，因此数据片段上的HVSS需要在准确性，效率和空间成本之间取得平衡。现有的基于磁盘的方法并没有同时考虑到所有这些要求。在本文中，我们提出了Starling，一种I/O高效的基于磁盘的图索引框架，它在片段中优化数据布局和搜索策略。",
