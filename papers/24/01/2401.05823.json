    "translated_abstract": "量子理论提供了一个全面的框架来量化不确定性，通常在量子金融中应用于研究资产回报的随机性质。这种视角将回报比作微观粒子运动，由类似物理定律的量子概率来控制。然而，这种方法假定了回报变化中特定的微观量子效应，这一前提因缺乏保证而受到批评。本文通过断言量子概率是复数的经典概率的数学扩展来偏离这种观点。它并不仅仅与微观量子现象相关联，避免了对回报中量子效应的需求。通过直接将量子概率的数学结构与交易者的决策和市场行为联系起来，它避免了对回报中量子效应的假设和波函数的引入。量子概率的复数相位捕捉到了交易者决策之间的转变，同时考虑了交易者之间的信息交互。",
