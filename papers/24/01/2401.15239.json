    "translated_abstract": "近年来，使用深度学习算法训练了许多具有高价值的深度神经网络(DNN)。为了保护原始所有者对这些DNN模型的知识产权(IP)，基于后门的水印已经得到了广泛研究。然而，大多数这种水印在应对模型提取攻击时失败，这种攻击利用输入样本查询目标模型并获得相应的输出，从而使用这些输入-输出对来训练替代模型。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的水印方法，名为MEA-Defender，用于保护DNN模型的知识产权免受模型提取攻击。具体而言，我们通过将输入域中来自两个源类的样本组合在一起获得水印，并设计了一个水印损失函数，使得水印的输出域处于主任务样本的输出域之内。由于我们水印的输入域和输出域都是主任务样本不可或缺的部分，因此水印将被提取出来并应用到目标模型中。",
