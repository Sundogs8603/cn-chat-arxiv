We propose a novel model training approach for federated learning, FLex&Chill, which exploits the Logit Chilling method. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that, in the presence of non-iid data characteristics inherent in federated learning systems, this approach can expedite model convergence and improve inference accuracy. Quantitatively, from our experiments, we observe up to 6X improvement in the global federated learning model convergence time, and up to 3.37% improvement in inference accuracy.",

    "translated_abstract": "联合学习由于本地客户端的非iid分布式训练数据而受到数据异质性的阻碍。我们提出了一种新的联合学习模型训练方法FLex&Chill，利用了Logit Chilling方法。通过广泛的评估，我们证明在联合学习系统中固有的非iid数据特征存在的情况下，这种方法可以加快模型收敛并提高推理精度。从我们的实验中，我们观察到全局联合学习模型收敛时间提高了6倍，推理精度提高了3.37%。",
