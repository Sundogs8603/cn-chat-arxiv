    "translated_abstract": "运动分割是自动驾驶中复杂但不可或缺的任务。摄像机的自我运动、鱼眼镜头的径向畸变以及对时间一致性的需求引入了挑战，使得传统和标准的卷积神经网络（CNN）方法效果较差。相应的繁琐的数据标注、多样化和罕见情况的表征以及广泛的数据采集需求强调了用于改善机器学习模型性能的合成数据的必要性。为此，我们使用Parallel Domain开发的PD-WoodScape合成数据集，以及WoodScape鱼眼数据集。因此，我们提出了WoodScape鱼眼运动分割挑战，作为CVPR 2023全景计算机视觉（OmniCV）研讨会的一部分举行。作为首个专注于鱼眼运动分割的比赛之一，我们旨在探索和评估其潜力和影响。",
