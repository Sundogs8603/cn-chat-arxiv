    "abstract": "The primary aim of Knowledge Graph embeddings (KGE) is to learn low-dimensional representations of entities and relations for predicting missing facts. While rotation-based methods like RotatE and QuatE perform well in KGE, they face two challenges: limited model flexibility requiring proportional increases in relation size with entity dimension, and difficulties in generalizing the model for higher-dimensional rotations. To address these issues, we introduce OrthogonalE, a novel KGE model employing matrices for entities and block-diagonal orthogonal matrices with Riemannian optimization for relations. This approach enhances the generality and flexibility of KGE models. The experimental results indicate that our new KGE model, OrthogonalE, is both general and flexible, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art KGE models while substantially reducing the number of relation parameters.",

    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱嵌入的主要目标是学习实体和关系的低维表示以预测缺失的事实。旋转-based方法如RotatE和QuatE在知识图谱嵌入中表现良好，但面临两个挑战：模型的灵活性有限，需要与实体维度成比例地增加关系大小，并且难以推广到更高维度的旋转。为了解决这些问题，我们引入了OrthogonalE，一种新颖的知识图谱嵌入模型，它利用矩阵表示实体和块对角正交矩阵与Riemannian优化表示关系。这种方法增强了知识图谱嵌入模型的广泛性和灵活性。实验结果表明，我们的新型知识图谱嵌入模型OrthogonalE既具有广泛性又具有灵活性，明显优于最先进的知识图谱嵌入模型，并显著减少了关系参数的数量。",
