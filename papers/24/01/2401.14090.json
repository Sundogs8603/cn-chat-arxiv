    "translated_abstract": "网络威胁归因在增加对数字威胁的抵御能力方面起着重要作用。最近的研究侧重于自动化威胁归因过程并将其与其他工作集成在一起，如威胁侦测。为了支持网络威胁归因过程的自动化，本文提出了一种模块化架构作为当前整体式自动化方法的替代方案。模块化架构可以利用舆情池来结合具体归因器的输出。所提出的解决方案增加了威胁归因问题的可追踪性，并提供了更高的可用性和可解释性，与整体式方法相比。此外，本文还提出了一种匹配聚合器作为一种聚合方法，根据不同的特征对归因器进行配对，生成中间结果，然后最终生成单个概率质量函数 (Probability Mass Function, PMF) 作为输出。匹配聚合器依次应用了对数舆情和累加运算来生成最终的PMF。",
