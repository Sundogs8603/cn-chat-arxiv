    "abstract": "Lexical normalization, a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), involves the transformation of words into their canonical forms. This process has been proven to benefit various downstream NLP tasks greatly. In this work, we introduce Vietnamese Lexical Normalization (ViLexNorm), the first-ever corpus developed for the Vietnamese lexical normalization task. The corpus comprises over 10,000 pairs of sentences meticulously annotated by human annotators, sourced from public comments on Vietnam's most popular social media platforms. Various methods were used to evaluate our corpus, and the best-performing system achieved a result of 57.74% using the Error Reduction Rate (ERR) metric (van der Goot, 2019a) with the Leave-As-Is (LAI) baseline. For extrinsic evaluation, employing the model trained on ViLexNorm demonstrates the positive impact of the Vietnamese lexical normalization task on other NLP tasks. Our corpus is publicly available exclusively for research purposes.",

    "translated_abstract": "词汇规范化是自然语言处理（NLP）中的一个基础任务，涉及将词语转换为它们的规范形式。已经证明，这个过程对各种后续的NLP任务有很大的益处。本文介绍了ViLexNorm，这是第一个为越南词汇规范化任务开发的语料库。该语料库包含了超过10,000对由人工标注的句子，这些句子来自越南最流行的社交媒体平台上的公开评论。我们使用了各种方法来评估我们的语料库，最佳系统在使用Error Reduction Rate (ERR)指标 (van der Goot, 2019a) 和Leave-As-Is (LAI)基准的情况下取得了57.74%的结果。在外部评估中，使用在ViLexNorm上训练的模型展示了越南词汇规范化任务对其他NLP任务的积极影响。我们的语料库仅供研究目的公开使用。",
