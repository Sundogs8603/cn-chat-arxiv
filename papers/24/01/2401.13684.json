    "abstract": "In the past 15 years, two international observatories have been intensively studying entrepreneurship using empirical studies with different methodologies: GEM and PSED. Both projects have generated a considerable volume of scientific production, and their intellectual structures are worth analyzing. The current work is an exploratory study of the knowledge base of the articles generated by each of these two observatories and published in prestigious journals. The value added of this work lies in its novel characterization of the intellectual structure of entrepreneurship according to the academic production of these two initiatives. The results may be of interest to the managers and members of these observatories, as well as to academics, researchers, sponsors and policymakers interested in entrepreneurship.",
