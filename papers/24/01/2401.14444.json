    "abstract": "The ICASSP 2024 Speech Signal Improvement Grand Challenge is intended to stimulate research in the area of improving the speech signal quality in communication systems. This marks our second challenge, building upon the success from the previous ICASSP 2023 Grand Challenge. We enhance the competition by introducing a dataset synthesizer, enabling all participating teams to start at a higher baseline, an objective metric for our extended P.804 tests, transcripts for the 2023 test set, and we add Word Accuracy (WAcc) as a metric. We evaluate a total of 13 systems in the real-time track and 11 systems in the non-real-time track using both subjective P.804 and objective Word Accuracy metrics.",
