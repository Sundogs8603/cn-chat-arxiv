While the use of ML in healthcare has several benefits, it also expands the threat surface of medical systems. We show that the use of ML in medical systems, particularly connected systems that involve interfacing the ML engine with multiple peripheral devices, has security risks that might cause life-threatening damage to a patient's health in case of adversarial interventions. These new risks arise due to security vulnerabilities in the peripheral devices and communication channels. We present a case study where we demonstrate an attack on an ML-enabled blood glucose monitoring system by introducing adversarial data points during inference. We show that an adversary can achieve this by exploiting a known vulnerability in the Bluetooth communication channel connecting the glucose meter with the ML-enabled app. We further show that state-of-the-art risk assessment techniques are not adequate for i",

    "translated_abstract": "在医疗领域中，机器学习支持的系统的采用数量不断增加。虽然在医疗保健中使用机器学习有很多好处，但它也扩大了医疗系统的威胁面。我们表明，在医疗系统中使用机器学习的过程中，特别是涉及将机器学习引擎与多个外围设备相连的连接系统中，存在安全风险，可能在敌对干预的情况下对患者的健康造成危害。这些新的风险来自外围设备和通信渠道的安全漏洞。我们展示了一个案例研究，演示了在推理过程中通过引入敌对数据点对机器学习血糖监测系统进行攻击的情况。我们展示了对手可以通过利用连接血糖仪与机器学习应用之间的蓝牙通信渠道中已知的漏洞来实现这一点。我们进一步表明，当前的风险评估技术不足以应对这些新的风险。",
