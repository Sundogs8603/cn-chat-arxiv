    "translated_abstract": "本论文提出了一种基于阻尼牛顿法的{\\delta}-PI算法，用于未知连续时间非线性系统的H∞跟踪控制问题。通过使用折现性能函数和增广系统来得到跟踪Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaac (HJI)方程。跟踪HJI方程是一个非线性偏微分方程，传统的强化学习方法用于解决跟踪HJI方程主要基于牛顿法，通常只能满足局部收敛并且需要一个良好的初始猜测。在阻尼牛顿迭代算子方程的基础上，首先推导出了广义的跟踪Bellman方程。{\\delta}-PI算法通过迭代求解广义跟踪Bellman方程来寻找跟踪HJI方程的最优解。分别提供了基于策略学习和离策略学习的{\\delta}-PI强化学习方法。基于离策略学习的{\\delta}-PI算法是一个无模型的算法。",
