    "translated_abstract": "无监督领域自适应回归（UDAR）旨在将来自有标签源领域的模型调整到无标签目标领域，以完成回归任务。最近在UDAR领域取得的成功主要集中在子空间对齐上，涉及整个特征空间中所选择子空间的对齐。这与用于分类的特征对齐方法形成对比，后者旨在对齐整个特征空间，在分类任务中已被证明是有效的，但在回归任务中效果较差。具体而言，分类任务旨在在整个嵌入空间的维度上识别独立的簇，而回归任务对数据表示的结构性要求较低，需要额外的指导以实现有效的对齐。在本文中，我们提出了一种通过不确定性引导的有效UDAR方法。我们的方法具有双重作用：提供了对预测结果的置信度衡量，并作为嵌入空间的正则化。具体而言，我们利用深度证据模型来提供对预测的置信度估计，并将其作为嵌入空间的正则项进行优化。",
