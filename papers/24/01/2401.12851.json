    "translated_abstract": "不同葡萄品种的分类是精准葡萄栽培中一个相关的表型分析任务，因为它可以估计不同品种的葡萄园行的生长情况，并涉及到葡萄酒行业的其他应用。这项任务可以通过破坏性的方法来完成，需要耗时的数据收集和实验室分析等任务。然而，无人机提供了一种更高效、 less prohibitive的方法来收集高光谱数据，尽管可能会获得更嘈杂的数据。因此，第一个任务是处理这些数据以纠正和降低大量数据的采样率。此外，葡萄品种的高光谱特征非常相似。在这项工作中，提出了一种卷积神经网络（CNN）用于对17种红白葡萄品种进行分类。与分类单个样本不同，这些样本与其周围环境一起进行处理。因此，需要进行空间特征的提取。",
