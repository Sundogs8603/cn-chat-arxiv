    "abstract": "In this paper, we present our approach to tackle Qur'an QA 2023 shared tasks A and B. To address the challenge of low-resourced training data, we rely on transfer learning together with a voting ensemble to improve prediction stability across multiple runs. Additionally, we employ different architectures and learning mechanisms for a range of Arabic pre-trained transformer-based models for both tasks. To identify unanswerable questions, we propose using a thresholding mechanism. Our top-performing systems greatly surpass the baseline performance on the hidden split, achieving a MAP score of 25.05% for task A and a partial Average Precision (pAP) of 57.11% for task B.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了我们在《古兰经问答2023》共享任务A和B中的方法。为了解决训练数据资源稀缺的挑战，我们依靠迁移学习和投票集成来提高在多次运行中的预测稳定性。此外，我们采用不同的体系结构和学习机制，针对两个任务使用一系列的阿拉伯语预训练Transformer模型。为了识别无法回答的问题，我们提出使用一个阈值机制。我们的最佳系统在隐藏数据集上的性能大大超过基准性能，任务A的MAP得分为25.05%，任务B的局部平均准确率(pAP)为57.11%。",
