    "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to rigorously interrogate conventional wisdom about centralization in block-building (due to, e.g., MEV and private order flow) and the outsourcing of block-building by validators to specialists (i.e., proposer-builder separation):  1.

Does proposer-builder separation eliminate heterogeneity and preserve decentralization among proposers?  This paper develops mathematical models and results that offer answers to these questions:  1. In a game-theoretic model with endogenous staking, heterogeneous block producer rewards, and staking costs, we quantify the extent to which heterogeneous rewards lead to concentration in the equilibrium staking distribution.  2. In a stochastic model in which heterogeneous block producers repeatedly reinvest rewards into staking, we quantify, as a function of the block producer heterogeneity, the rate at which stake concentrates ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在严格审视关于区块链建设中的集中化（例如，MEV和私密订单流）以及验证者将建设块外包给专家（即提案者-建设者分离）的常规观点：1.技能和知识的异质性是否不可避免地导致集中化？2.提案者-建设者分离是否消除了异质性并保持了提案者的去中心化？本文开发了数学模型和结果，为这些问题提供了答案：1.在具有内生质押、异质性区块生产者奖励和质押成本的博弈理论模型中，我们量化了异质性奖励导致均衡质押分布集中程度的程度。2.在一个随机模型中，异质性区块生产者反复将奖励投资到质押中，我们量化了质押集中程度与区块生产者异质性之间的关系。",
