    "translated_abstract": "随着对处理图结构数据的图神经网络（GNN）的探索不断扩大，由于其通用逼近能力，尤其是它们在因果分析方面的潜力，它们被期望能够显著增强常见的基于图的任务，如分类和预测。然而，对于因果增强的GNN框架的研究仍然不够深入。为了解决这个问题，我们的研究深入探讨了九种基准图分类模型，在跨越三个不同领域的七个数据集上对它们的强度和灵活性进行了测试，以确定因果性对GNN预测能力的影响。这项研究对这些模型进行了详细评估，揭示了它们在不同数据环境中的效率和灵活性，并突出了需要进一步开发的领域。我们的发现对于深化对GNN在不同数据中心领域的理解和实际应用具有重要意义。",
