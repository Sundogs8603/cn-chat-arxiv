This also hinders the knowledge interaction between humans and NN, preventing humans from getting involved to give direct guidance when NN's decisions go wrong. While recent research in explainable AI has achieved interpretability of NN from various perspectives, it has not yet provided effective methods for knowledge exchange between humans and NN. To address this problem, we constructed a two-way interaction interface that uses structured representations of visual concepts and their relationships as the \"language\" for knowledge exchange between humans and NN. Specifically, NN provide intuitive reasoning explanations to humans based on the class-specific structural concepts graph (C-SCG). On the other hand, humans can modify the biases present in the C-SC",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管神经网络（NN）已经广泛应用于各个领域，并且通常优于人类，但它们在一定程度上仍然缺乏可解释性，人类无法直观地理解NN的决策逻辑。这也妨碍了人类与NN之间的知识交互，阻止了人们在NN的决策出错时直接参与给予指导。虽然最近在可解释AI方面的研究已经从各个角度实现了NN的可解释性，但尚未提供有效的人类和NN之间的知识交流方法。为了解决这个问题，我们构建了一个双向交互界面，它将视觉概念及其关系的结构化表示作为人类和NN之间的知识交流的“语言”。具体而言，NN基于类别特定结构概念图（C-SCG）向人类提供直观的推理解释。另一方面，人类可以修改C-SCG中存在的偏见。",
