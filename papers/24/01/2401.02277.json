    "abstract": "The universal approximation theorem states that a neural network with one hidden layer can approximate continuous functions on compact sets with any desired precision. This theorem supports using neural networks for various applications, including regression and classification tasks. Furthermore, it is valid for real-valued neural networks and some hypercomplex-valued neural networks such as complex-, quaternion-, tessarine-, and Clifford-valued neural networks. However, hypercomplex-valued neural networks are a type of vector-valued neural network defined on an algebra with additional algebraic or geometric properties. This paper extends the universal approximation theorem for a wide range of vector-valued neural networks, including hypercomplex-valued models as particular instances.

    "translated_abstract": "通用逼近定理表明，具有一层隐藏层的神经网络可以以任意所需的精度逼近紧集上的连续函数。该定理支持了神经网络在回归和分类任务等各种应用中的使用。此外，对于实值神经网络和一些超复值神经网络（例如复数、四元数、四元数矢量和Clifford值神经网络），该定理均有效。然而，超复值神经网络是一种在具有附加代数或几何性质的代数上定义的向量值神经网络。本文将通用逼近定理扩展到了广泛的向量值神经网络，包括超复值模型作为特殊实例。具体而言，我们引入了非退化代数的概念，并阐述了在这种代数上定义的神经网络的通用逼近定理。",
