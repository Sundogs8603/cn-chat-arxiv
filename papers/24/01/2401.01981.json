    "translated_abstract": "贝叶斯优化是一种针对黑盒子目标函数的原则性优化策略。它在科学发现和实验设计等各种实际应用中的效果得到了证明。通常，贝叶斯优化的性能是通过基于遗憾的度量来评估的，如瞬时遗憾、简单遗憾和累积遗憾。这些度量仅依赖于函数评估，因此它们不考虑查询点和全局解之间的几何关系，也不考虑查询点本身。值得注意的是，它们不能区分是否成功找到了多个全局解。此外，它们也不能评估贝叶斯优化在给定搜索空间中利用和探索的能力。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了四个新的几何度量，即精确度、召回率、平均度和平均距离。这些度量使我们能够比较考虑查询点和全局最优解的几何特性的贝叶斯优化算法。",
