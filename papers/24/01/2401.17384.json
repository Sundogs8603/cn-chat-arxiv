Efforts to boost African farmers' agricultural production through fertilizer use can inadvertently promote the growth of aquatic vegetation that hosts disease vectors. Recent trials established that removing aquatic vegetation habitat for snail intermediate hosts reduces schistosomiasis infection rates in children, while converting the harvested vegetation into compost boosts agricultural productivity and incomes. Our model illustrates how this ecological intervention changes the feedback between the human and natural systems, potentially freeing rural households from poverty-disease traps. We develop a bioeconomic model that interacts an analytical microeconomic model of agricultural households' behavior, health status and incomes over time with a dynamic model of schistosomiasis disease ecology. We calibrate the model with field data from northern Senega",

    "translated_abstract": "传染病会降低劳动生产力和收入，使人们陷入恶性循环的不健康和贫困中。通过使用化肥来增加非洲农民的农业生产力可能会无意间促进水生植被的生长，从而成为疾病媒介的栖息地。最近的试验表明，清除供螺类中间宿主栖息地的水生植被可以降低儿童的血吸虫感染率，而将收获的植被转化为堆肥可以提高农业生产力和收入。我们的模型说明了这种生态干预如何改变人类和自然系统之间的反馈，潜在地使农村家庭摆脱贫困-疾病陷阱。我们开发了一个生态经济模型，该模型通过一个分析性微观经济模型与随时间变化的血吸虫病生态动态模型相互作用，来描述农业家庭在行为、健康状况和收入方面的演变。我们使用塞内加尔北部的现场数据对模型进行校准。",
