    "translated_abstract": "发音障碍语音重建（DSR）系统旨在将发音障碍的语音自动转换为听起来正常的语音。该技术能够改善受神经运动障碍影响的演讲者与人们的交流，并提升他们的社交融入度。基于NED（神经编码器-解码器）的系统相较于基于GAN（生成对抗网络）的方法在重建语音的可懂度方面有了显著提高，但该方法仍受到级联流程和内容编码器的辅助任务导致的训练效率不高的限制，而这可能会影响重建的质量。受到自监督语音表示学习和离散语音单元的启发，我们提出了Unit-DSR系统，利用HuBERT的强大领域自适应能力来提升训练效率，并利用语音单元在离散语言空间中约束发音障碍内容的恢复。与NED方法相比，Unit-DSR系统具有更好的性能。",
