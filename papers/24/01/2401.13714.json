    "translated_abstract": "在微控制器单元（MCU）上部署神经网络面临着计算和存储资源有限的严重挑战。之前的研究探索了基于块的推理作为一种在不损失模型精度的情况下节省存储器的策略。然而，这种技术存在严重的冗余计算开销，导致执行延迟显著增加。解决这个问题的可行解决方案是混合精度量化，但它面临着精度降级和耗时搜索的挑战。在本文中，我们提出了QuantMCU，一种利用基于价值驱动的混合精度量化来减少冗余计算的新型基于块的推理方法。我们首先利用基于价值驱动的块分类（VDPC）来保持模型的精度。VDPC将块分为两类，根据它们是否包含异常值。对于包含异常值的块，我们对特征图进行8位量化。",
