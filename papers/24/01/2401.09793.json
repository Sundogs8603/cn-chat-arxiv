    "translated_abstract": "异常检测是时间序列分析的关键方面，旨在识别时间序列样本中的异常事件。这一任务的核心挑战在于在缺乏标签的情况下有效地学习正常和异常模式的表示。先前的研究大多依赖于基于重构的方法，限制了模型的表征能力。此外，大多数当前的深度学习方法不够轻量级，这促使我们设计一个更高效的异常检测框架。本研究中，我们介绍了PatchAD，一种新颖的多尺度基于块的MLP-Mixer体系结构，利用对比学习进行表征提取和异常检测。具体而言，PatchAD由四个独特的MLP Mixer组成，专门利用MLP架构实现高效和轻量级的架构。此外，我们还创新地设计了一个双项目约束模块来缓解潜在的问题。",
