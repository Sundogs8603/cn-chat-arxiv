    "translated_abstract": "主题模型几十年来一直被广泛应用于无监督方式下发现潜在主题和推断文档的主题比例。它们在文本分析和上下文推荐等各种应用中得到广泛应用。近年来，神经网络的崛起促成了一个新的研究领域——神经主题模型(NTMs)的出现。与传统的主题模型不同，NTMs直接优化参数，而不需要模型特定的推导。这使得NTMs具有更好的可扩展性和灵活性，吸引了大量的研究关注并产生了丰富的新方法和应用。在本文中，我们对神经主题模型的方法、应用和挑战进行了全面的调研。具体而言，根据网络结构系统地组织了当前NTM方法，并介绍了针对短文本和跨语言文档等各种场景的NTMs。我们还讨论了广泛应用的一系列热门应用。",
