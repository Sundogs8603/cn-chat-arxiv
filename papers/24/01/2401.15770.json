    "translated_abstract": "机器学习在预测法律案例结果方面表现出有希望的前景，但大多数研究集中在民事法律案例而非案例法系统上。我们确定了在使用案例法进行法律案例结果预测时的两个独特挑战。首先，识别作为法官在决策过程中基本证据的相关先例案例至关重要。其次，有必要考虑法律原则随时间演变的情况，因为早期案例可能遵循不同的法律背景。在本文中，我们提出了一个名为PILOT（法律案例结果预测）的新框架。它包括用于相关案例检索和时间模式处理的两个模块。为了衡量现有法律案例结果预测模型的性能，我们从大规模案例法数据库中策划了一个数据集。我们证明了准确识别先例案例的重要性以及缓解...",
