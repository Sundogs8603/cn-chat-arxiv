    "abstract": "We present a novel corpus consisting of orthographically variant words found in works of 19th century U.S. literature annotated with their corresponding \"standard\" word pair. We train a set of neural edit distance models to pair these variants with their standard forms, and compare the performance of these models to the performance of a set of neural edit distance models trained on a corpus of orthographic errors made by L2 English learners. Finally, we analyze the relative performance of these models in the light of different negative training sample generation strategies, and offer concluding remarks on the unique challenge literary orthographic variation poses to string pairing methodologies.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个新的语料库，其中包含19世纪美国文学作品中的正字异形词汇，并对其进行了对应的“标准”词对的标注。我们训练了一组神经编辑距离模型，将这些变体与它们的标准形式进行配对，并将这些模型的性能与训练在L2英语学习者的正字错误语料库上的一组神经编辑距离模型的性能进行比较。最后，我们分析了这些模型在不同负训练样本生成策略下的相对性能，并对文学正字变异对字符串配对方法带来的独特挑战提出了结论性的意见。",
