    "translated_abstract": "在快速发展的多Agent系统领域中，确保在陌生和敌对环境中的稳健性至关重要。尽管这些系统在熟悉环境中表现出色，但在新情况下往往会因为训练阶段的过拟合而失败。在既包含合作又包含竞争行为的环境中，这一问题尤为突出，体现了过拟合和泛化挑战的双重性质。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了通过多样性启示的多Agent稳健性诊断（MADRID），这是一种生成多Agent策略中暴露战略漏洞的多样化对抗场景的新方法。MADRID利用开放式学习的概念，导航对抗环境的广阔空间，使用目标策略的遗憾值来衡量这些环境的漏洞。我们在11vs11版的Google Research Football上评估了MADRID的有效性。",
