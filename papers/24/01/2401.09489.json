    "translated_abstract": "近年来，时间序列异常检测取得了显著进展。然而，在检测到异常之后，我们能解释它吗？这样的解释对于处理异常非常有用。例如，在一个炼油厂中，我们是通过派遣液压工程师还是实习生更换传感器电池来响应异常？虽然有一些并行的努力来解释异常，但很多提出的技术产生的解释是间接的，并且通常比它们试图解释的异常更复杂。我们对各个领域前线从业人员使用的文献、清单和用户手册进行了评估，发现了一个有趣的共同点。大多数从业人员以以下格式讨论、解释和报告异常：如果没有破坏B，异常就会像正常数据A一样。读者将会意识到这是一种反事实的解释。在这项工作中，我们引入了一种领域无关的反事实解释方法。",
