    "translated_abstract": "分数蒸馏采样（SDS）及其变种极大地推动了文本到3D生成领域的发展，但容易出现几何崩溃和质量差的纹理。为了解决这个问题，我们首先深入分析了SDS，并发现它的蒸馏采样过程实际上对应于随机微分方程（SDE）的轨迹采样：SDS沿着SDE轨迹进行采样，以产生一个更少带噪声的样本，这个样本则作为优化3D模型的指导。然而，SDE采样中的随机性经常导致样本多样且不可预测，不总是更少带噪声，因此不是一个一致正确的指导，这解释了SDS的易受攻击性。由于对于任何SDE，总是存在一个普通微分方程（ODE），其轨迹采样可以确定性和一致地收敛到所需目标点作为SDE，我们提出了一种新颖有效的“Consistent3D”方法，探索ODE的确定性采样先验以解决这个问题。",
