    "abstract": "Effective collaboration requires groups to strategically regulate themselves to overcome challenges. Research has shown that groups may fail to regulate due to differences in members' perceptions of challenges which may benefit from external support. In this study, we investigated the potential of leveraging three distinct natural language processing models: an expert knowledge rule-based model, a supervised machine learning (ML) model and a Large Language model (LLM), in challenge detection and challenge dimension identification (cognitive, metacognitive, emotional and technical/other challenges) from student discourse, was investigated. The results show that the supervised ML and the LLM approaches performed considerably well in both tasks, in contrast to the rule-based approach, whose efficacy heavily relies on the engineered features by experts. The paper provides an extensive discussion of the three approaches' performance for automated detection and support of students' challenge",

    "translated_abstract": "有效的协作需要团队在面对挑战时进行战略性的自我调控。研究表明，团队可能因成员对挑战的认知差异而无法进行调控，而这种情况可能受益于外部支持。本研究探讨了利用三种不同的自然语言处理模型：专家知识基于规则的模型、监督式机器学习模型和大型语言模型（LLM），在从学生对话中检测挑战和确定挑战维度（认知、元认知、情感和技术/其他挑战）方面的潜力。结果显示，监督式机器学习和大型语言模型在这两个任务中表现得相当好，而基于规则的方法效果较差，其功效严重依赖于专家设计的特征。本文对这三种方法在自动检测和支持学生挑战过程中的性能进行了广泛讨论。",
