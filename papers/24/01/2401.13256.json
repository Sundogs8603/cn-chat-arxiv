    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型在许多自然语言理解和生成任务中展示出了非凡的能力。然而，在对话系统中涉及到多个信息源时，个性化问题仍然是一个令人向往的属性。为了更好地计划和整合多个信息源在生成个性化回复中的使用，我们首先将其分解为三个子任务：知识源选择、知识检索和回复生成。然后，我们提出了一种新颖的统一多源检索增强生成系统（UniMS-RAG）。具体来说，我们在训练期间使用相同的序列到序列范式将这三个子任务统一起来，通过使用特殊的令牌，即行动令牌和评估令牌，能够自适应地检索证据并评估关联性。使语言模型能够生成行动令牌有助于与各种知识源进行交互，使其能够适应其上下文和生成个性化的回复。",
