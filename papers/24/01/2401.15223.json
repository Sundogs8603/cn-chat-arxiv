    "translated_abstract": "近年来，机器学习在遥感分析中变得至关重要，特别是在土地利用/土地覆盖（LULC）领域。机器学习和卫星图像分析的协同作用在这一领域展现出显著的生产力，有多个研究证明了这一点。该领域的一个显著挑战是对广阔领土上的土地使用进行语义分割映射，其中准确的土地利用数据的获取和地面真实土地利用标签的可靠性带来了重大困难。例如，在比利时的佛兰德地区，提供详细准确的像素级标记数据集尤其有价值。然而，在全球许多地区，针对此类研究缺乏规范化和形式化的数据集和工作流程。本文介绍了一个全面的方法来解决这些差距。我们提供了一个佛兰德地区配对的Sentinel-2卫星图的密集标记地面真相地图。",
