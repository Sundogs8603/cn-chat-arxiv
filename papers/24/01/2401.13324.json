This gap between conveyed information and information that matters to affected stakeholders can impede understanding and adherence to regulatory frameworks such as the AI Act. To address this gap, we present the \"XAI Novice Question Bank\": A catalog of affected stakeholders' information needs in two ADM use cases (employment prediction and health monitoring), covering the categories data, system context, system usage, and system specifications. Information needs were gathered in an interview study where participants received explanations in response to their inquiries. Participants further reported their understanding and decision confidence, showing that while confidence tended to increase after receiving explanations, participants also met understanding challenges, such as being unable to tell why their understanding felt incomplete.

    "translated_abstract": "AI系统的解释很少涉及到受算法决策影响的人的信息需求。这种传达信息与受影响利益相关者所关心的信息之间的差距可能阻碍对监管框架（如AI法案）的理解和遵守。为了解决这个差距，我们提出了“XAI初学者问题库”：这是一个涵盖两个算法决策应用领域（就业预测和健康监测）中受影响利益相关者信息需求的目录，包括数据、系统背景、系统使用和系统规范等类别。信息需求是通过访谈研究收集的，参与者根据自己的问题获得解释。参与者还报告了他们的理解和决策信心，结果显示，尽管在接受解释后信心倾向于增加，但参与者也面临着理解上的挑战，如无法解释为什么自己的理解感觉不完整。解释还对理解产生了影响。",
