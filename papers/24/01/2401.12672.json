    "abstract": "Graph analysis is fundamental in real-world applications. Traditional approaches rely on SPARQL-like languages or clicking-and-dragging interfaces to interact with graph data. However, these methods either require users to possess high programming skills or support only a limited range of graph analysis functionalities. To address the limitations, we propose a large language model (LLM)-based framework called ChatGraph. With ChatGraph, users can interact with graphs through natural language, making it easier to use and more flexible than traditional approaches. The core of ChatGraph lies in generating chains of graph analysis APIs based on the understanding of the texts and graphs inputted in the user prompts. To achieve this, ChatGraph consists of three main modules: an API retrieval module that searches for relevant APIs, a graph-aware LLM module that enables the LLM to comprehend graphs, and an API chain-oriented finetuning module that guides the LLM in generating API chains.",

    "translated_abstract": "图分析在现实世界的应用中是基础性的。传统方法要么依赖于类似SPARQL的语言，要么依赖于点击和拖动式的界面与图数据进行交互。然而，这些方法要么要求用户具备高级编程技能，要么仅支持有限范围的图分析功能。为解决这些限制，我们提出了一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的框架，称为ChatGraph。通过ChatGraph，用户可以通过自然语言与图进行交互，使得使用比传统方法更加简单和灵活。ChatGraph的核心在于基于对用户提示中的文本和图像的理解生成图分析API链。为实现这一目标，ChatGraph包括三个主要模块：API检索模块用于搜索相关API，图分析LLM模块使LLM能够理解图数据，以及API链导向的微调模块用于指导LLM生成API链。",
