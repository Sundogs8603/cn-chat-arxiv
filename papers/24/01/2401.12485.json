    "translated_abstract": "绝热量子计算机可以解决困难的优化问题（例如二次无约束二进制优化问题），并且它们似乎非常适合用于训练机器学习模型。在本文中，我们描述了一种用于训练支持向量机的绝热量子方法。我们展示了我们的量子方法的时间复杂度比经典方法好一个数量级。接下来，我们在五个基准数据集（Iris，Wisconsin乳腺癌（WBC），Wine，Digits和Lambeq）上将我们的量子方法的测试准确率与使用Python中的Scikit-learn库的经典方法进行了比较。我们展示了我们的量子方法获得了与经典方法相当的准确度。最后，我们进行了一项可扩展性研究，其中我们计算了量子方法和经典方法在训练数据集中特征数量和数据点数量增加时的总训练时间。我们的可扩展性结果显示，量子方法具有良好的可扩展性。",
