    "translated_abstract": "学习和理解宗教存在复杂性和教义深度的挑战。问答机器人作为解决这些挑战的问题回答系统，可以帮助。LLM聊天机器人利用自然语言处理技术建立主题之间的联系，准确回答复杂问题。这些能力使其成为用于宗教启蒙的问题回答聊天机器人的理想选择。然而，LLM也有生成虚假信息的倾向，称为幻觉。聊天机器人的回答可能包含侮辱个人宗教信仰、跨宗派冲突和有争议或敏感的话题的内容。它需要避免这种情况，而不会宣扬仇恨言论或冒犯某些群体的人或他们的信仰。本研究使用基于向量数据库的检索增强生成（RAG）方法来提高LLMs的准确性和透明度。我们的问答系统称为\"MufassirQAS\"。我们创建了一个模型来评估该系统并证明其在解决宗教行业问题中的效果。",
