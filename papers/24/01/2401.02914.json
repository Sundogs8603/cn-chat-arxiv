    "translated_abstract": "在实际强化学习中，探索是一个重要的挑战，而将认知不确定性和偶然不确定性量化的不确定性感知探索被认为是一种有效的探索策略。然而，捕捉偶然和认知不确定性的联合效应用于决策是困难的。现有的研究分别估计了偶然和认知不确定性，并将组合不确定性视为两者的加法组合。然而，这种加法形式会导致过度冒险行为，导致不稳定性。在本文中，我们提出了一种算法，澄清了偶然和认知不确定性之间的理论联系，统一了偶然和认知不确定性估计，并量化了两种不确定性对风险敏感的探索的综合影响。我们的方法基于一种新颖的分布式强化学习扩展，其估计了一个参数化的回报分布，其参数化范围。",
