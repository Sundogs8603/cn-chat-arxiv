    "abstract": "In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the field of autonomous driving with the aim of increasing safety and efficiency. However, research that focuses on tractor-trailer vehicles is relatively sparse. Due to the physical characteristics and articulated joints, such vehicles require tailored models. While turning, the back wheels of the trailer turn at a tighter radius and the truck often has to deviate from the centre of the lane to accommodate this. Due to the lack of publicly available models, this work develops truck and trailer models using the high-fidelity simulation software CARLA, together with several roundabout scenarios, to establish a baseline dataset for benchmarks. Using a twin-q soft actor-critic algorithm, we train a quasi-end-to-end autonomous driving model which is able to achieve a 73% success rate on different roundabouts.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，自动驾驶领域取得了显著进展，旨在提高安全性和效率。然而，对于拖车车辆的研究相对较少。由于其物理特性和铰接关节，这种车辆需要定制模型。在转弯时，拖车的后轮以更小的半径转动，卡车经常需要偏离车道中心来适应这种情况。由于缺乏公开可用的模型，本研究利用高保真度模拟软件CARLA开发了卡车和拖车模型，并使用几个环岛场景建立了基准数据集。使用双Q软件演员评论算法，我们训练了一个准端到端的自动驾驶模型，在不同环岛上实现了73%的成功率。",
