    "translated_abstract": "在当代社会，生活和工作的压力不断增加，心理疾病已成为现代健康关注的重要问题，而COVID-19疫情进一步凸显了这个问题。青少年抑郁的患病率正在稳步上升，而传统的诊断方法，如量表或面试，对于检测青少年抑郁显得尤为不足。面对这些挑战，出现了许多基于人工智能的方法来辅助诊断心理健康问题。然而，大多数这些方法都集中在量表存在的基本问题上，或者采用多模态方法，如面部表情识别。根据日常习惯和行为来诊断抑郁风险的研究局限于小规模的定性研究。我们的研究利用青少年人口普查数据来预测抑郁风险，重点关注儿童对抑郁的经历和他们的日常生活情况。我们引入了一种方法",
