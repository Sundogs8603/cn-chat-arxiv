    "abstract": "Utilizing administrative data to predict outcomes is an important application area of machine learning, particularly in healthcare. Most administrative data records are timestamped and the pattern of records over time is a key input for machine learning models. This paper explores how best to divide the observation window of a machine learning model into time segments or \"bins\". A computationally efficient process is presented that identifies which data features benefit most from smaller, higher resolution time segments. Results generated on healthcare and housing/homelessness administrative data demonstrate that optimizing the time bin size of these high priority features while using a single time bin for the other features achieves machine learning models that are simpler and quicker to train. This approach also achieves similar and sometimes better performance than more complex models that default to representing all data features with the same time resolution.",

    "translated_abstract": "利用行政数据预测结果是机器学习的一个重要应用领域，尤其在医疗保健领域。大多数行政数据记录都有时间戳，记录随时间的模式是机器学习模型的关键输入。本文探讨了如何将机器学习模型的观察窗口划分为时间段或“bins”。提出了一种计算上高效的过程，可以确定哪些数据特征最适合较小的，更高分辨率的时间段。在医疗保健和住房/无家可归的行政数据上产生的结果表明，在其他特征使用单个时间bin的情况下，优化这些高优先级特征的时间bin大小可以实现更简单，更快速训练的机器学习模型。这种方法还可以实现与更复杂的模型相似甚至更好的性能，这些模型默认将所有数据特征用相同的时间分辨率表示。",
