    "abstract": "This research aims to provide a framework to assess the contribution of digital currencies to promote financial inclusion, based on a diagnosis of the landscape of financial inclusion and domestic and cross-border payments in Latin America and the Caribbean. It also provides insights from central banks in the region on key aspects regarding a possible implementation of central bank digital currencies. Findings show that although digital currencies development is at an early stage, a well-designed system could reduce the cost of domestic and cross-border payments, improve the settlement of transactions to achieve real-time payments, expand the accessibility of central bank money, incorporate programmable payments and achieve system performance demands.",

    "translated_abstract": "该研究旨在提供一个框架，评估数字货币对促进金融包容的贡献，基于对拉美和加勒比地区金融包容和国内外支付情况的诊断。它还提供了该地区央行对央行数字货币可能实施的关键问题的见解。研究结果表明，尽管数字货币的发展处于早期阶段，但一个精心设计的系统能够降低国内和跨境支付成本，改善交易结算以实现实时支付，扩大中央银行货币的可访问性，融入可编程支付，并满足系统性能需求。",
