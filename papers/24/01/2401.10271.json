    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种使用倒排索引通过部分或完全匹配三元组来查询三元概念的新方法，以检索已经计算出的包含一组术语在它们的范围、意图和/或方式中的三元概念。与Ananias中描述的近似方法相反，该方法(i)不需要保留初始的三元上下文或其三个二元对应物，(ii)避免通过上下文探索对三元组分量应用推导运算符，(iii)消除了通过因子分解阶段获取作为一维查询答案的三元概念的要求。此外，我们的解决方案引入了一种新的度量指标，用于根据与给定查询的相似性对检索到的三元概念进行排序。最后，我们主要进行了一项经验研究，以说明我们的方法相对于近似方法的有效性和可扩展性。我们的解决方案不仅展示了卓越的效率，也提供了高质量的查询结果。",
