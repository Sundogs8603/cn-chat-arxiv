    "translated_abstract": "在大规模、高维度数据中确保可复现的发现结果的算法在许多信号处理应用中至关重要。近年来，出现了多变量虚警率（FDR）控制方法，即使在变量数量超过样本数量的高维情况下，也能提供保证。然而，在存在高度相关变量组的情况下，这些方法往往无法可靠地控制FDR，在基因组学和金融等领域中很常见。为了解决这个关键问题，我们引入了一个考虑一般依赖结构的新框架。我们提出的依赖感知T-Rex选择器将层次图模型整合到T-Rex框架中，以有效利用变量之间的依赖结构。利用鞅论，我们证明了我们的变量惩罚机制确保了FDR的控制。我们进一步通过陈述和证明了一个清晰的FDR控制框架的推广。",
