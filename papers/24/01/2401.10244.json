    "translated_abstract": "提出了一种新的基于图神经网络的推荐模型KGLN，该模型利用知识图谱（KG）信息，提高了个性化推荐的准确性和效果。该模型首先利用单层神经网络将图中的个体节点特征合并，然后通过结合影响因素调整相邻实体的聚合权重。通过迭代，模型从单层逐渐演变为多层，使实体能够获取丰富的多阶关联实体信息。最后，将实体和用户的特征结合起来产生推荐分数。通过比较不同聚合方法和影响因素的效果，评估了模型的性能。在使用MovieLen-1M和Book-Crossing数据集进行测试时，KGLN相对于LibFM和D等已有基准方法，AUC（ROC曲线下的面积）提高了0.3%至5.9%和1.1%至8.2%。",
