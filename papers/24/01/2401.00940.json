If congestion costs are introduced to the player's maximization problem in a multi-cubic delivery network, the congestion paradox arises where all coordinates become congested as long as the previous assumptions about payoffs are maintained.",

    "translated_abstract": "在单个立方交付网络中，如果玩家保证在每个交付路径上获得相同的回报，玩家的最佳反应是随机分割所有商品并将它们交付给所有其他节点，而且最佳反应满足Kuhn-Tucker条件。交付网络的状态是随机完整的。如果在多立方交付网络中引入拥堵成本到玩家的最大化问题中，那么拥堵悖论就会出现，只要之前对回报的假设保持不变，所有坐标都会拥堵。",
