This method bootstraps seed information through a large language model and retrieves related data from public corpora. It not only collects knowledge-related data for specific domains but unearths the data with potential reasoning procedures.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型在各种任务中展示了显著的潜力，然而特定领域的开源模型和数据仍然非常稀缺。之前的研究主要集中在手动指定资源和收集特定领域的高质量数据，这消耗了大量时间和精力。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于大型语言模型的高效数据收集方法“CC查询”。该方法通过大型语言模型引导种子信息，并从公开文献中检索相关数据。它不仅收集了特定领域的知识相关数据，还揭示了潜在的推理过程数据。通过应用这种方法，我们构建了一个名为“Knowledge Pile”的高质量数据集，涵盖了包括STEM科学和人文科学在内的四个主要领域。实验结果表明，“Knowledge Pile”显著改善了",
