Our life and research environment have continually evolved, often accompanied by controversial opinions about new methodologies. In this paper, we embrace this change by introducing a new approach to qualitative analysis in HCI using Large Language Models (LLMs). We detail a method that uses LLMs for qualitative data analysis and present a quantitative framework using SBART cosine similarity for performance evaluation. Our findings indicate that LLMs not only match the efficacy of traditional analysis methods but also offer unique insights. Through a novel dataset and benchmark, we explore LLMs' characteristics in HCI research, suggesting potential avenues for further exploration and application in the field.",

    "translated_abstract": "如果我们仍然需要用打字机“发送”论文，研究会是怎样的？我们的生活和研究环境不断演变，往往伴随着对新方法论的争议。在本文中，我们通过引入一种基于Large Language Models（LLMs）的定性分析新方法来拥抱这种变化。我们详细介绍了一种使用LLMs进行定性数据分析的方法，并提出了一个使用SBART余弦相似度进行性能评估的定量框架。我们的研究结果表明，LLMs不仅与传统分析方法有效性相匹配，还提供了独特的洞察力。通过一个新颖的数据集和基准，我们探索了LLMs在人机交互研究中的特点，提出了进一步探索和应用的潜在方向。",
