In this work, we introduce a Tensor Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN) and examine its performance on a real defect detection application in one of the components of the ultrasonic sensors produced at Robert Bosch's manufacturing plants. Our quantum-inspired T-CNN operates on a reduced model parameter space to substantially improve the training speed and performance of an equivalent CNN model without sacrificing accuracy. More specifically, we demonstrate how T-CNNs are able to reach the same performance as classical CNNs as measured by quality metrics, with up to fifteen times fewer parameters and 4% to 19% faster training times. Our results demonstrate that the T-CNN greatly outperforms the results of traditional human visual inspection, providing value in a current real application in manufacturing.",

    "translated_abstract": "缺陷检测是制造业质量控制阶段中最重要但也最具挑战性的任务之一。在本研究中，我们引入了一种张量卷积神经网络（T-CNN），并在罗伯特·博世制造厂生产的超声波传感器组件的真实缺陷检测应用中考察其性能。我们的量子启发式T-CNN在减少的模型参数空间上运行，极大地提高了等效CNN模型的训练速度和性能，而不会牺牲准确性。具体来说，我们演示了T-CNN可以通过质量指标来衡量与传统CNN相同的性能，但参数数量只有其15倍少，训练时间快4%至19%。我们的结果表明，T-CNN大大超越了传统人类视觉检查的结果，在当前制造应用中具有价值。",
