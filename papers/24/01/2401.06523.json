We introduce a family of score functions based on arbitrary regression techniques, for which we establish necessary conditions to consistently favor the true causal ordering. Our analysis reveals that boosting with early stopping meets these criteria and thus offers a consistent score function for causal orderings. To address the challenges posed by high-dimensional data sets, we adapt our approach through a component-wise gradient descent in the space of additive SEMs. Our simulation study underlines our theoretical results for lower dimensions and demonstrates that our high-dimensional adaptation is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. In addition, it exhibits robustness with respect to the choice of the hyperparameters making the procedure easy to tune.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于提升方法的学习加法结构方程模型(SEMs)的方法，重点关注确定变量间因果顺序的理论方面。我们引入了一类基于任意回归技术的评分函数，为其建立了一致地支持真实因果顺序的必要条件。我们的分析表明，提升方法与提前停止符合这些条件，从而为因果顺序提供了一致的评分函数。为了应对高维数据集带来的挑战，我们通过在加法结构方程模型空间中进行逐分量梯度下降来改进我们的方法。我们的模拟研究强调了我们的理论结果在较低维度下的有效性，并证明了我们的高维适应方法与最先进的方法相当。此外，我们的方法对于超参数的选择具有鲁棒性，使得程序易于调整。",
