    "abstract": "Explainability in deep networks has gained increased importance in recent years. We argue herein that an AI must be tasked not just with a task but also with an explanation of why said task was accomplished as such. We present a basic framework -- Task and Explanation Network (TENet) -- which fully integrates task completion and its explanation. We believe that the field of AI as a whole should insist -- quite emphatically -- on explainability.",

    "translated_abstract": "在最近几年中，深度网络的可解释性变得越来越重要。我们在此论文中提出，AI不仅要完成任务，还要解释为什么这样完成任务。我们提出了一个基本框架——任务和解释网络（TENet），它完全整合了任务完成和解释。我们认为整个AI领域都应该强调可解释性。",
