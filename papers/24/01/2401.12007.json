    "translated_abstract": "图分类是一项重要的图结构数据学习任务。图神经网络（GNNs）近年来在图学习中引起了越来越多的关注，并在许多重要的图问题上显示出显著的改进。尽管现有的GNNs在性能上处于最前沿，但它们只使用了每个节点周围非常有限的邻域的局部信息，导致了多模态信息的丢失和过多计算的开销。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新颖的Tensor视图拓扑图神经网络（TTG-NN），这是一种简单而有效的基于持久同调、图卷积和张量运算的拓扑深度学习方法。这种新方法同时捕捉了局部和全局层面上的Tensor视图拓扑（TT）和Tensor视图图（TG）结构信息，并在计算上充分利用了图的拓扑和结构。",
