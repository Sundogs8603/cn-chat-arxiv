    "abstract": "This paper introduces ESPnet-SPK, a toolkit designed with several objectives for training speaker embedding extractors. First, we provide an open-source platform for researchers in the speaker recognition community to effortlessly build models. We provide several models, ranging from x-vector to recent SKA-TDNN. Through the modularized architecture design, variants can be developed easily. We also aspire to bridge developed models with other domains, facilitating the broad research community to effortlessly incorporate state-of-the-art embedding extractors. Pre-trained embedding extractors can be accessed in an off-the-shelf manner and we demonstrate the toolkit's versatility by showcasing its integration with two tasks. Another goal is to integrate with diverse self-supervised learning features. We release a reproducible recipe that achieves an equal error rate of 0.39% on the Vox1-O evaluation protocol using WavLM-Large with ECAPA-TDNN.",
