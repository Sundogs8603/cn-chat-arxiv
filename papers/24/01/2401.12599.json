    "translated_abstract": "随着大型语言模型（LLM）的快速发展，检索增强的生成（RAG）已成为专业知识问答领域中的主要方法。目前，主要的基础模型公司已经开放了嵌入式和聊天API接口，而LangChain等框架已经整合了RAG流程。看似RAG中的关键模型和步骤已经得到解决，这就引出了一个问题：专业知识问答系统是否接近完美了？本文发现当前的主要方法依赖于访问高质量的文本语料库的前提。然而，由于专业文档主要以PDF形式存储，PDF解析的低准确性显著影响了基于专业知识的问答的效果。我们在数百个来自相应真实世界专业文档的问题上进行了经验性的RAG实验。结果显示，ChatDOC是一个配备了全景视图功能的RAG系统，能够提高问答的准确性和效率。",
