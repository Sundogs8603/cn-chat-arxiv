    "translated_abstract": "在人工智能技术发展的早期阶段，预测其可能带来的负面影响是一个挑战。使用LLMs增强和指导这一过程是一种不太被研究的预测方法。尽管LLMs和评估指标在生成文本中考虑偏差方面有所进展，但目前尚不清楚这些模型在预测任务中表现如何。具体而言，使用LLMs预测人工智能影响引发了关于模型能够生成的负面影响类别的质量和范围的问题。在本文中，我们利用丰富的包含对新兴技术的规范性评估的数据来源——新闻媒体，制定了一个基准，用于比较不同类别的影响。通过计算分析全球数百个在线新闻媒体发布的数千篇新闻文章，我们建立了一个包含十个类别的人工智能影响分类法。然后，我们评估了基于指令的LLMs模型（GPT-4等）和基于迁移学习的模型在根据我们的分类法生成的影响方面的表现。",
