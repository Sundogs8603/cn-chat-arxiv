    "translated_abstract": "急性肾损伤（AKI）是危重病患者中常见的并发症，影响着高达50%的重症监护病房患者。缺乏标准化和开源工具，以应用肾脏疾病改善全球结果（KDIGO）标准对时间序列数据进行分类，对工作量和研究质量产生了负面影响。本项目介绍了pyAKI，一个开源流程，通过提供全面的KDIGO标准一致性实施方案，填补了这一空白。利用常用的重症监护病房研究数据库Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV的子集，我们定义了一个标准化的数据模型，以确保可重复性。与专家注释的验证表明，pyAKI在实施KDIGO标准方面表现出了稳健的性能。比较分析表明，它能够超越人工标签的质量。本工作将pyAKI作为一种开源解决方案引入。",
