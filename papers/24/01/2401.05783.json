    "translated_abstract": "在对话推荐系统 (CRS) 中，用户可以在每次交互中提供对推荐物品的反馈，从而使CRS朝更理想的推荐方向发展。目前，不同类型的CRS提供了各种各样的反馈可能性，例如自然语言反馈或回答澄清问题。在大多数情况下，使用用户模拟器进行训练和评估CRS。这种用户模拟器通常根据对单个目标物品的了解对当前检索到的物品进行批判。然而，使用模拟器在离线环境中评估系统存在一些问题，比如完全关注于单个目标物品（不能解决推荐系统的探索性质），并表现出极大的耐心（在大量交互上给出一致的反馈）。为了克服这些限制，我们在常见的CRS数据集（Shoes和Fashion IQ Dresses）中为一部分替代物品获取额外的评价。进一步地，我们提出了改进的用户模拟器框架，以提高CRS的评估性能。",
