    "abstract": "Machine learning models typically focus on specific targets like creating classifiers, often based on known population feature distributions in a business context. However, models calculating individual features adapt over time to improve precision, introducing the concept of decoupling: shifting from point evaluation to data distribution. We use calibration strategies as strategy for decoupling machine learning (ML) classifiers from score-based actions within business logic frameworks. To evaluate these strategies, we perform a comparative analysis using a real-world business scenario and multiple ML models. Our findings highlight the trade-offs and performance implications of the approach, offering valuable insights for practitioners seeking to optimize their decoupling efforts. In particular, the Isotonic and Beta calibration methods stand out for scenarios in which there is shift between training and testing data.",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习模型通常专注于特定目标，比如创建分类器，通常基于商业环境中已知的人群特征分布。然而，计算个体特征的模型随时间而适应，以提高精度，引入解耦的概念：从点评估转向数据分布。我们使用校准策略作为解耦机器学习（ML）分类器与基于得分的业务逻辑框架中的行动的策略。为了评估这些策略，我们使用一个真实的商业场景和多个ML模型进行了比较分析。我们的发现突出了这种方法的权衡和性能影响，并为寻求优化解耦努力的从业者提供了有价值的见解。特别是在训练和测试数据之间存在转变的情况下，等距和贝塔校准方法表现出色。",
