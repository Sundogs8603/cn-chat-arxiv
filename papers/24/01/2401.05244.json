    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的使用基于Hamilton神经网络的Monte Carlo采样的子集模拟方法，用于可靠性分析。所提出的策略将Hamilton Monte Carlo方法的优越采样与使用Hamilton神经网络进行计算高效梯度评估相结合。这种组合特别有优势，因为神经网络结构保持了Hamiltonian的特性，而Hamiltonian定义了Hamilton Monte Carlo采样器的接受准则。因此，这种策略在低计算成本下可以实现高接受率。我们的方法使用子集模拟来估计小概率失效。然而，在低概率样本区域中，梯度评估尤其具有挑战性。我们展示了所提出策略的显著准确性，并将其效率与传统的Hamilton Monte Carlo方法进行比较。我们注意到，这种方法在梯度评估方面存在限制。",
