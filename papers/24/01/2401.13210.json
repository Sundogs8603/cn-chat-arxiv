    "translated_abstract": "在网络时代，图机器学习已广泛应用于无处不在的图结构数据上。作为支持网络安全和提高基于图的应用程序鲁棒性的关键组件，图异常检测的重要性不断增加。虽然图神经网络（GNNs）在监督和半监督图异常检测方面表现出了效果，但其性能取决于足够的真实标签的可用性。在识别复杂图结构中的异常点方面，劳动密集型的特性在实际应用中带来了重大挑战。尽管如此，来自其他任务（例如节点分类）的间接监督信号相对丰富。本文提出了一种新颖的多任务主动图异常检测框架，名为MITIGATE。首先，通过耦合节点分类任务，MITIGATE能够检测到没有已知异常的离群节点。其次，利用多个任务的共享表示来提升检测性能。",
