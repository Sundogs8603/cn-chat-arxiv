    "translated_abstract": "在计量经济学中，统计物理学中已知的自旋系统模型被用作基于代理的模型。计量经济学中的经济物理学研究越来越多地发展了描述交换现象的通用市场模型，并在粒子数量变化的背景下使用物理学中已知的化学势 $\\mu$。在统计物理学中，已知化学势的状态方程，该方程考虑了相应的模型框架和相应的状态变量。将这些状态方程简单地应用于经济物理学中的问题似乎很困难。据我们所知，即使对于最简单的理想代理系统模型，化学势的状态方程也尚未得到推导。本文填补了这一研究空白，并从理想代理系统的经济物理学模型假设中推导出了化学势的状态方程。对状态方程的解释导致了基本的发现。",
