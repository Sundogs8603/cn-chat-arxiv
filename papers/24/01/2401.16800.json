    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种名为\"mspace\"的在线算法，用于预测时态图中的节点特征，该算法能够灵活地捕捉不同节点之间的空间交叉相关性以及节点内的时间自相关性。该算法可用于概率和确定性的多步预测，适用于估计和生成任务。与基于图神经网络（GNN）和经典卡尔曼滤波器的各种基线方法进行比较评估，结果表明mspace与最先进的方法水平相当，甚至在某些数据集上超过它们。重要的是，mspace在具有不同训练样本大小的数据集上表现出一致的鲁棒性，这是与GNN方法相比的一个显著优势，后者需要丰富的训练样本来有效地学习数据中的时空趋势。因此，在训练样本有限的情况下，采用mspace具有优势。此外，我们建立了理论模型来证明该算法的性能保证，进一步验证了mspace的有效性。",
