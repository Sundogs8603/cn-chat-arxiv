    "abstract": "arXiv:2401.06836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various emotion recognition tasks, thereby piquing the research community's curiosity for exploring their potential in emotional intelligence. However, several issues in the field of emotional generation tasks remain unresolved, including human preference alignment and emotional generation assessment. In this paper, we propose the Emotional Chain-of-Thought (ECoT), a plug-and-play prompting method that enhances the performance of LLMs on various emotional generation tasks by aligning with human emotional intelligence guidelines. To assess the reliability of ECoT, we propose an automated model-based evaluation method called Emotional Generation Score (EGS). EGS incorporates Goleman's Emotional Intelligence Theory as a consensus of human experts, providing a new perspective on the evaluation of emotional generation tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate ",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在各种情绪识别任务中表现出色，引起了研究界对探索它们在情感智能中潜力的好奇心。然而，情感生成任务领域仍存在一些问题，包括人类偏好的对齐和情感生成评估。本文提出了一种名为情感思维链（ECoT）的即插即用提示方法，通过与人类情感智力指南对齐来增强LLMs在各种情感生成任务上的表现。为了评估ECoT的可靠性，我们提出了一种称为情感生成得分（EGS）的自动化基于模型的评估方法。EGS将戈尔曼的情绪智力理论作为人类专家共识，为情感生成任务的评估提供了新的视角。大量实验结果证明...",
