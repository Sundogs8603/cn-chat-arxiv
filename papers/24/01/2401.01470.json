    "translated_abstract": "视觉Transformer（ViTs）在各种计算机视觉任务上取得了有希望的结果，然而它们在输入令牌数量上的二次复杂度限制了它们在资源受限环境下的应用。以前的方法采用逐渐减少令牌来解决这个挑战，假设一个层中的令牌冗余意味着所有后续层中也有冗余。我们经验证明这个假设通常是不正确的，即一个层中多余的令牌在后面的层中可以是有用的。基于这个关键洞察力，我们提出了一种新颖的令牌传播控制器（TPC），它结合了两种不同的令牌分布，即暂停概率和重新开始概率，用来控制令牌的减少和重复利用，从而实现更高效的令牌利用。为了改善令牌分布的估计，我们提出了一种平滑机制，作为正则化器，有助于去除噪声异常值。此外",
