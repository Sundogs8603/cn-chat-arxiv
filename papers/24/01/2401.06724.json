    "abstract": "Equity auctions display several distinctive characteristics in contrast to continuous trading. As the auction time approaches, the rate of events accelerates causing a substantial liquidity buildup around the indicative price. This, in turn, results in a reduced price impact and decreased volatility of the indicative price. In this study, we adapt the latent/revealed order book framework to the specifics of equity auctions. We provide precise measurements of the model parameters, including order submissions, cancellations, and diffusion rates. Our setup allows us to describe the full dynamics of the average order book during closing auctions in Euronext Paris. These findings support the relevance of the latent liquidity framework in describing limit order book dynamics. Lastly, we analyze the factors contributing to a sub-diffusive indicative price and demonstrate the absence of indicative price predictability.",

    "translated_abstract": "与连续交易相比，股权拍卖具有几个不同的特点。随着拍卖时间的临近，事件的发生率加快，导致市价周围出现大量的流动性积聚。这反过来减少了市价的价格影响和波动性。在本研究中，我们将潜在/显性订单簿框架应用于股权拍卖的具体情况。我们提供了模型参数的精确测量，包括订单提交、取消和扩散速率。我们的设置使我们能够描述巴黎泛欧交易所收市拍卖期间平均订单簿的完整动态。这些发现支持潜在流动性框架在描述限价委托簿动态方面的相关性。最后，我们分析了导致次扩散市价的因素，并证明了市价可预测性的缺失。",
    "tldr": "这项研究利用潜在流动性模型，研究了股权拍卖中的动态特征，并提供了相关参数的精确测量。结果表明，拍卖接近结束时，事件发生率加快，导致市价周围流动性积聚，从而减少市价的价格影响和波动性。同时，研究发现限价委托簿的动态可通过潜在流动性框架进行描述，并且市价的次扩散是不可预测的。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study utilizes latent liquidity models to examine the dynamic characteristics of equity auctions and provides precise measurements of relevant parameters. The findings show that as the auction time approaches, the rate of events accelerates, leading to a buildup of liquidity around the market price and reducing the price impact and volatility. Additionally, the study demonstrates the relevance of the latent liquidity framework in describing the dynamics of limit order books and the unpredictability of sub-diffusive indicative prices."
