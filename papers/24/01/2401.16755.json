The issue of uncovering interaction relations in such systems using observable dynamics is called relational inference. In this study, we propose a Diffusion model for Relational Inference (DiffRI), inspired by a self-supervised method for probabilistic time series imputation. DiffRI learns to infer the probability of the presence of connections between components through conditional diffusion modeling. Experiments on both simulated and quasi-real datasets show that DiffRI is highly competent compared with other state-of-the-art models in discovering ground truth interactions in an unsupervised manner. Our code will be made public soon.",

    "translated_abstract": "复杂相互作用系统的动态行为，包括大脑活动、金融价格波动和物理集体现象，与系统组成部分之间的相互作用相关。利用可观测的动态来发现这些系统中的相互作用关系被称为关系推理。在本研究中，我们提出了一种关系推理的扩散模型(DiffRI)，它借鉴了一种自监督的概率时间序列插值方法。DiffRI通过条件扩散建模学习推断组件之间连接存在的概率。对于模拟和准真实数据集的实验证明，DiffRI在无监督方式下发现地面真实相互作用方面与其他最先进的模型相比具有很高的能力。我们的代码将很快公开。",
