    "abstract": "This paper provides robust estimators and efficient inference of causal effects involving multiple interacting mediators. Most existing works either impose a linear model assumption among the mediators or are restricted to handle conditionally independent mediators given the exposure. To overcome these limitations, we define causal and individual mediation effects in a general setting, and employ a semiparametric framework to develop quadruply robust estimators for these causal effects. We further establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators and prove their local semiparametric efficiencies. The proposed method is empirically validated via simulated and real datasets concerning psychiatric disorders in trauma survivors.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提供了关于涉及多个交互中介的因果效应的鲁棒估计器和有效推断。大多数现有的工作或者对中介者之间施加线性模型的假设，或者只能处理在给定曝光情况下条件独立的中介者。为了克服这些限制，我们在一个一般的设置中定义了因果和个体中介效应，并利用半参数框架开发了对这些因果效应的四重稳健估计器。我们进一步建立了所提出估计器的渐近正态性，证明了它们的局部半参数效率。通过模拟和实际数据集验证了所提方法在创伤幸存者的精神障碍方面的效果。",
