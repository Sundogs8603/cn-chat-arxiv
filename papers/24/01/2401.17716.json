    "translated_abstract": "情感原因对提取（ECPE）涉及在文档中提取代表情感和原因的从句对。现有方法往往过度拟合存在的基准数据集中的偶然相关性，如位置偏差，而不是捕捉语义特征。受最近的研究启发，我们探索利用大型语言模型（LLM）在不额外训练的情况下解决ECPE任务。尽管具有强大的能力，LLM存在无法控制的输出问题，导致性能中等。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了“思维链”来模仿人类的认知过程，并提出了分解情感-原因链（DECC）框架。通过融合引导推理和逻辑修剪的方法，DECC引导LLM处理ECPE任务。我们进一步通过引入上下文学习来增强框架。实验结果表明，DECC相比最先进的有监督微调方法更强大。最后，我们分析了每个组成部分的有效性和框架的鲁棒性。",
