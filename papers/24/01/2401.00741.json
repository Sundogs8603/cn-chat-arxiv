    "translated_abstract": "现有的工具学习评估主要集中于验证大型语言模型（LLMs）选择的工具与期望结果的一致性。然而，这些方法依赖于一组有限的情景，在这些情景中答案可以事先确定，与真实需求背道而驰。此外，仅关注结果忽视了LLMs有效利用工具所需的复杂能力。为解决这个问题，我们提出了ToolEyes，这是一个特别针对LLMs工具学习能力在真实情景中评估的细粒度系统。该系统详细分析了七个真实情景，分析了对LLMs在工具学习中至关重要的五个维度：格式对齐，意图理解，行为规划，工具选择和答案组织。此外，ToolEyes还包含一个拥有约600种工具的工具库，作为LLMs与物理世界之间的中介。在涉及三个类别的十个LLMs的评估中，ToolEyes取得了如下的创新与贡献。",
