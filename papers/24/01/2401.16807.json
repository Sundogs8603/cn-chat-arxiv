    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs），如ChatGPT，在文本生成方面产生了重大影响，尤其是在写作辅助领域。尽管伦理考虑强调了在科学交流中透明地承认LLM的使用的重要性，但真实的承认仍然很少见。鼓励准确承认LLM辅助写作的一个潜在途径涉及使用自动检测器。我们对四个前沿的LLM生成文本检测器进行了评估，发现它们的性能不如一个简单的临时检测器，该检测器设计用于识别在LLM大量出现时的突然写作风格变化。我们认为，开发专门用于LLM辅助写作检测的专用检测器是必要的。这样的检测器可以在促进对LLM参与科学交流的更真实认可、解决当前承认实践中的挑战方面发挥关键作用。",
