    "translated_abstract": "在多模态知识图谱（MMKG）中，多模态实体对齐（MMEA）对于识别不同模态属性间的相同实体至关重要。然而，由于缺失模态属性而导致的语义不一致性是一个重要挑战。传统方法依赖于属性插值，但这往往会引入模态噪声，扭曲原始语义。此外，缺乏一个普适的理论框架限制了对语义一致性的进展。本研究引入了一种新方法DESAlign，通过应用基于狄利克雷能量的理论框架来确保语义一致性来解决这些问题。我们发现，语义不一致性导致模型过度拟合模态噪声，特别是在模态缺失时造成性能波动。DESAlign创新地应对了过度平滑问题，并使用现有模态插值缺失的语义。我们的方法包括一个多模态知识图谱学习的部分。",
