    "translated_abstract": "时空预测在许多现实应用中起着重要作用，如交通预测、空气污染物预测、人群流量预测等。现有的时空预测模型采用数据驱动方法，并且严重依赖数据的可用性。当数据不完整时，这些模型的准确性会受到影响，而实际情况中由于部署和维护传感器收集数据的高昂成本，数据不完整是很常见的。一些最近的研究尝试解决数据不完整的问题。它们通常假设在一个感兴趣区域内要么有一段时间的某些数据可用，要么在一些地点有一些数据可用。本文进一步研究了在没有任何历史观测的感兴趣区域进行时空预测的问题，以解决区域发展不均衡、传感器逐步部署或缺乏开放数据等情况。我们提出了一种名为STSM的模型来完成这个任务。该模型采用对比学习方法。",
