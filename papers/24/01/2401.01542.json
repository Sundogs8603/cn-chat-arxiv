    "translated_abstract": "在将数据转发给其他可能使用数据的机构之前，网络运营商或数据所有者通过匿名化保护数据隐私是一个关键问题。随着人工智能的采用，数据匿名化增加了掩盖必要敏感信息的可能性，防止数据泄漏和信息丢失。OpenWiFi网络容易受到试图获取或了解流量的任何敌对方的攻击，而不考虑数据所有者所拥有的知识。应用条件表格生成对抗网络（CTGAN）来解决发现实际流量信息的几率问题。CTGAN产生合成数据，伪装成真实数据，但透露了真实数据的隐藏信息。本文展示了使用聚类算法对合成数据与实际数据的相似性评估，然后比较了针对无监督聚类验证指标的性能。一个广为人知的算法，K-Means表现优秀。",
