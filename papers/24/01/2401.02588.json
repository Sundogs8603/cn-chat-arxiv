    "translated_abstract": "卫星在轨道上的加速部署引起了对在轨维修（OOS）、卫星检查和主动清除碎片（ADR）的兴趣。这类任务需要在非合作的、可能是未知的驻留空间物体附近进行精确的交会和靠近操作。由于载人任务的安全问题和地面控制的延迟，必须实现完全自主化。这需要对目标的几何形状进行可靠的表征。本文提出了一种基于3D高斯粒子投影的卫星几何形状映射方法，可以在当前航天硬件上的计算资源上运行。我们在一个硬件环路卫星模拟装置上展示了模型训练和3D渲染性能，在几种逼真的光照和运动条件下。我们的模型显示出能够在机载上进行训练，并以比之前快近两个数量级的速度生成未知卫星的更高质量的新视角。",
