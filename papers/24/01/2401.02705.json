    "translated_abstract": "过去几年，我们致力于自动化微信支付的用户验收测试（UAT）过程，这是中国最具影响力的移动支付应用之一。我们开发了一个名为XUAT的系统用于这个目的。然而，在当前系统中仍然存在一个人力密集阶段，即测试脚本的生成。因此，在本文中，我们集中研究提高当前系统自动化水平的方法，特别是测试脚本生成阶段。近年来，大型语言模型（LLMs）取得了显著的成功，展示了获取人类智能的潜力，并且已经形成了一个不断增长的研究领域，使用LLMs作为自主智能体来获得类似人类的决策能力。受到这些工作的启发，我们提出了一个基于LLM的多智能体协作系统，名为XUAT-Copilot，用于自动UAT。该系统主要由三个以LLM为基础的智能体组成，负责动作规划、状态检测和...",
