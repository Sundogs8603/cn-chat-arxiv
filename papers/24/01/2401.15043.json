    "abstract": "Objective: The reading level of health educational materials significantly influences information understandability and accessibility, particularly for minoritized populations. Many patient educational resources surpass the reading level and complexity of widely accepted standards. There is a critical need for high-performing text simplification models in health information to enhance dissemination and literacy. This need is particularly acute in cancer education, where effective prevention and screening education can substantially reduce morbidity and mortality.  Methods: We introduce Simplified Digestive Cancer (SimpleDC), a parallel corpus of cancer education materials tailored for health text simplification research. Utilizing SimpleDC alongside the existing Med-EASi corpus, we explore Large Language Model (LLM)-based simplification methods, including fine-tuning, reinforcement learning (RL), reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), domain adaptation, and prompt-based app",

    "translated_abstract": "目标：健康教育材料的阅读水平显著影响信息的可理解性和可接触性，特别是对于少数族裔人群。许多患者教育资源超过了广泛接受的标准的阅读水平和复杂性。在健康信息中，急需高性能的文本简化模型以增强传播和识字能力。这种需要在癌症教育中尤为迫切，有效的预防和筛查教育可以大大减少发病率和死亡率。方法：我们引入了简化的消化癌症（SimpleDC）并行语料库，用于健康文本简化研究。利用SimpleDC和现有的Med-EASi语料库，我们探索了基于大型语言模型（LLM）的简化方法，包括微调、增强学习（RL）、增强学习与人类反馈（RLHF）、领域自适应和基于提示的应用。",
