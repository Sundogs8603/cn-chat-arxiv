    "translated_abstract": "在可持续发展时代，企业面临着如何投资于绿色创新以及绿色创新对其经济轨迹的影响的决策。本研究采用Crepon、Duguet和Mairesse（CDM）框架，通过利用每个阶段的预测因变量来消除不可观察因素，检验了研发资金转化为专利以及其对生产力的影响。本研究在扩展经典CDM模型的基础上，对比了绿色创新和非绿色创新的经济效应。结果显示，非绿色专利主导着生产力的提升，而绿色专利对非重度污染企业的影响有限。然而，在高污染和制造业领域，两种创新类型同样增强了生产力。通过无条件分位数回归，我发现绿色创新的生产力影响呈现出一个反U形状，而非绿色创新则呈现出一个U形状。值得注意的是，在第50到80个分位数之间，",
