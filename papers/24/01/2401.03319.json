    "abstract": "Today, many users deploy their microservice-based applications with various interconnections on a cluster of Cloud machines, subject to stochastic changes due to dynamic user requirements. To address this problem, we compare three machine learning (ML) models for predicting the microservice call rates based on the microservice times and aiming at estimating the scalability requirements. We apply the linear regression (LR), multilayer perception (MLP), and gradient boosting regression (GBR) models on the Alibaba microservice traces. The prediction results reveal that the LR model reaches a lower training time than the GBR and MLP models. However, the GBR reduces the mean absolute error and the mean absolute percentage error compared to LR and MLP models. Moreover, the prediction results show that the required number of replicas for each microservice by the gradient boosting model is close to the actual test data without any prediction.",

    "translated_abstract": "如今，许多用户在一群云机器上部署基于微服务的应用程序，这些应用程序具有各种相互连接，并受到动态用户需求的随机变化的影响。为了解决这个问题，我们比较了三种机器学习（ML）模型，用于基于微服务时间预测微服务调用率，并旨在估计可扩展性要求。我们在阿里巴巴的微服务跟踪数据上应用了线性回归（LR）、多层感知机（MLP）和梯度提升回归（GBR）模型。预测结果显示，与GBR和MLP模型相比，LR模型的训练时间更短。然而，与LR和MLP模型相比，GBR模型降低了均方差和平均绝对百分比误差。此外，预测结果显示，梯度提升模型对每个微服务所需的副本数量与实际测试数据非常接近，而无需进行任何预测。",
