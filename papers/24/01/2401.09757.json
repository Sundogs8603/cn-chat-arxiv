    "translated_abstract": "利用现有的地面基础设施为空中用户提供覆盖是一种潜在的低成本解决方案。然而，已经部署的地面基站（TBSs）由于向下倾斜的天线导致弱的地空（G2A）覆盖。此外，由于三维空间中复杂的信号覆盖需求，特别是在垂直方向上，实现整个空域的最佳覆盖仍然具有挑战性。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于合作三点（CoTP）模型的方法，利用合作波束增强G2A覆盖扩展。为了利用现有的TBSs建立有效的合作，我们证明三个TBSs之间的合作可以确保具有最小覆盖重叠的G2A覆盖，并设计了CoTP模型来分析G2A覆盖扩展。利用该模型，基于德劳内三角剖分的合作覆盖结构被设计为划分三棱柱形状的土地空间。",
