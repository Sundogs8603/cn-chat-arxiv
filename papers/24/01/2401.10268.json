    "translated_abstract": "人工智能在工业界和学术界中都取得了巨大的发展。然而，工业界近期的突破性进展引起了人们对学术研究在该领域中的作用的新视角。在这里，我们对过去25年中两个环境中产生的人工智能的影响和类型进行了描述，并建立了几种模式。我们发现，由工业界研究人员组成的团队发表的文章往往更受关注，具有更高的被引用和引发引用颠覆的可能性，且更有可能产生最先进的模型。相反，我们发现纯学术团队发表了大部分的人工智能研究，并倾向于产生更高程度的创新工作，单篇论文有数倍的可能性是非常不寻常和典型的。工业界和学术界在影响力-创新度方面的优势不受子领域、团队规模、资历和声望的影响。我们发现学术界产生了更多综述和分析型论文，而工业界则更多地注重应用和技术发展。",
