    "translated_abstract": "Beimingwu是一个学习软件范式，旨在使用户能够重复使用许多现有的经过良好训练的模型，而不是从头开始构建机器学习模型，期望能解决超出模型原始目的的新用户任务。在这个范式中，全球开发人员可以随时将他们高性能的模型匿名提交到学习软件集线器系统（之前称为学习软件市场），而不用透露他们的训练数据。一旦集线器系统接受了该模型，它会分配一个规范，并容纳该模型。这个规范允许根据未来用户的需求充分识别和组装模型的重复使用，即使他们没有对该模型的先验知识。这个范式与当前的大模型方向有很大区别，并且有望学习软件集线器系统可以容纳数百万甚至更多的高性能模型，为计划任务和非计划、专业任务提供出色的能力。",
