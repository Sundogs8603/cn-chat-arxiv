    "translated_abstract": "两个玩家的普通和差分博弈的值是Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs（HJI）方程的粘性解。这种博弈的值和策略逼近受到维度诅咒（CoD）的影响。通过物理信息神经网络（PINN）减轻CoD时，由于状态约束引起的值的不连续性，会遇到收敛问题。除了这些挑战之外，在对博弈参数空间进行学习时（例如，在信息不完整时进行博弈参数推断），通常需要学习可推广的值和策略。为了应对这些挑战，我们在本文中提出了一种Pontryagin模式的神经算子，在具有参数化状态约束的博弈中胜过现有的最先进算法（SOTA）。我们的关键贡献在于引入了一种在前向和反向共轭状态回滚之间的差异上定义的共轭状态损失，这种损失计算成本低廉。我们证明了共轭状态动力学的不连续性在该算子的性能改进中的重要性。",
