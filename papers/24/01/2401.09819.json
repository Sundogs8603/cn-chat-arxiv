    "translated_abstract": "传统的路径规划器，如基于采样的路径规划器，在初始解敏感性和收敛到最优解速度上具有局限性。然而，在许多应用中，如具有有限功率/燃料的自动驾驶车辆中，在短时间内找到近似最优解是具有挑战性的。为了实现端到端近似最优路径规划器，我们首先将路径规划问题分为两个子问题，即路径空间分段和给定路径空间中的航点生成。我们进一步提出了一个名为路径规划网络（PPNet）的两级级联神经网络来解决路径规划问题，通过解决上述子问题。此外，我们提出了一种名为EDaGe-PP的用于路径规划的高效数据生成方法。结果显示，PPNet训练集由EDaGe-PP生成的成功率相比其他方法提升了$2\\times$，总计算时间少于1/33。我们验证了PPNet的性能。",
