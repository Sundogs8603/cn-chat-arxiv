EMPAIA integrates various stakeholders of the pathology AI ecosystem, i.e., pathologists, computer scientists, and industry. In close collaboration, we developed technical interoperability standards, recommendations for AI testing and product development, and explainability methods.

    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年中，病理学中的人工智能方法有了显著的进展。然而，由于技术和监管方面的种种挑战，将这些研究成果转化为临床诊断产品并推广应用的速度仍然较慢，其中包括缺乏标准化的接口。开放和供应商中立的EMPAIA计划致力于解决这些挑战。本文概述了EMPAIA的成果和经验教训。EMPAIA将病理学AI生态系统的各种利益相关方，如病理学家、计算机科学家和工业界进行紧密合作。在紧密合作中，我们制定了技术互操作性标准，AI测试和产品开发的建议，以及可解释性方法。我们实现了模块化和开源的EMPAIA平台，并成功将来自6个不同供应商的11个基于AI的图像分析应用程序集成到该平台上，展示了不同应用程序如何使用统一的标准化接口。",
