    "translated_abstract": "脑电图（EEG）是一种非侵入性的记录生物电信号的技术。近年来，将监督式深度学习技术与脑电信号相结合，已经在各种基于脑电的任务上实现了自动分析。然而，脑电信号的标签问题限制了基于脑电的深度模型的发展。获取脑电注释是困难的，需要领域专家指导收集和标记，并且不同受试者之间的脑电信号的变化会导致显著的标签偏移。为了解决上述挑战，提出了自我监督学习（SSL）通过设计良好的预训练任务从无标签样本中提取表示。本文聚焦于将自我监督学习框架与时间序列脑电信号相结合，实现高效的表示，并提出了对脑电信号的自我监督学习的系统综述。在本文中，1）我们介绍了自我监督学习的概念和理论，以及典型的自我监督学习框架。2）我们提供了一份全面的综述，概述了目前的研究进展、方法和应用场景，并指出了未来的研究方向。",
