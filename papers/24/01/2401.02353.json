    "abstract": "It is known that a player in a noncooperative game can benefit by publicly restricting his possible moves before play begins. We show that, more generally, a player may benefit by publicly committing to pay an external party an amount that is contingent on the game's outcome. We explore what happens when external parties -- who we call ``game miners'' -- discover this fact and seek to profit from it by entering an outcome-contingent contract with the players. We analyze various structured bargaining games between miners and players for determining such an outcome-contingent contract. These bargaining games include playing the players against one another, as well as allowing the players to pay the miner(s) for exclusivity and first-mover advantage. We establish restrictions on the strategic settings in which a game miner can profit and bounds on the game miner's profit. We also find that game miners can lead to both efficient and inefficient equilibria.",

    "translated_abstract": "众所周知，在一个非合作博弈中，玩家可以通过在游戏开始之前公开限制自己的可能行动来获益。我们展示了更一般的情况下，玩家可以通过公开承诺向外部参与方支付一个依赖于游戏结果的金额来获益。我们探讨了外部参与方（被我们称作“游戏挖矿者”）发现这个事实并试图通过与玩家签订与游戏结果相关的合同来从中获利的情况。我们分析了矿工和玩家之间进行各种结构化谈判游戏来确定这种与游戏结果相关的合同的情况。这些谈判游戏包括让玩家相互竞争，以及允许玩家向矿工支付独家权和先行者优势。我们对矿工可以获利的战略设定进行了限制，并得出了矿工的利润上限。我们还发现，游戏挖矿者可能导致有效和无效的均衡状态。",
