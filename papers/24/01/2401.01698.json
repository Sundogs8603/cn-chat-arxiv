Colexification, i.e.~a type of similarity where a single lexical form is used to convey multiple meanings, is underexplored. In our work, we shed light on the linguistic causes of cross-lingual similarity in colexification and phonology, by exploring genealogical stability (persistence) and contact-induced change (diffusibility). We construct large-scale graphs incorporating semantic, genealogical, phonological and geographical data for 1,966 languages. We then show the potential of this resource, by investigating several established hypotheses from previous work in linguistics, while proposing new ones. Our results strongly support a previously established hypothesis in the linguistic literature, while offering contradicting evidence to another. Our large scale resource opens for further research across disciplines, e.g.~in multilingual NLP and comparative linguistics.",

    "translated_abstract": "语言的相似性可能是由于遗传关系、区域接触、普遍性或偶然性。合词是一种未被充分研究的相似性类型，即使用一个词汇形式来表达多个意义。在我们的工作中，通过研究家族稳定性（持久性）和接触诱发变化（扩散性），我们揭示了合词和音韵跨语言相似性的语言原因。我们构建了涵盖1966种语言的大规模图，包括语义、家族、音韵和地理数据。我们通过研究语言学领域以前工作中的几个已建立的假设，并提出新的假设，展示了这一资源的潜力。我们的结果强烈支持语言学文献中一个之前已建立的假设，同时提供了对另一个假设的证据。我们的大规模资源为跨学科研究提供了更多的可能性，例如多语言自然语言处理和比较语言学。",
