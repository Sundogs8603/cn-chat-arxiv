The prior literature has estimated relationships between street network design and transport emissions -- including greenhouse gases implicated in climate change -- primarily through case studies focusing on certain world regions or relatively small samples of cities, complicating generalizability and applicability for evidence-informed practice. Our worldwide study finds that straighter, more-connected, and less-overbuilt street networks are associated with lower transport emissions, all else equal.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究估计了街道网络特征和交通部门二氧化碳排放之间的关系，覆盖了世界上每个城市地区，并调查了这些关系是否在不同发展水平和城市设计范式中相同。以往的研究主要通过针对特定世界地区或相对较小的城市样本的案例研究来估计街道网络设计和交通排放之间的关系，这使得其推广性和适用性受到了限制。我们的全球研究发现，相较于其他因素，更直线、更连通、更不过度建造的街道网络与较低的交通排放相关。重要的是，这些关系在不同的发展水平和设计范式之间存在差异，然而大部分以往的文献报告的结果并不符合全球标准。规划者需要一个更好的实证基础来指导实践。",
