    "translated_abstract": "检查大型语言模型（LLM）的隐藏表示中编码的信息可以解释模型的行为并验证其与人类价值观的一致性。鉴于LLM生成人类可理解文本的能力，我们建议利用模型本身以自然语言解释其内部表示。我们引入了一个称为Patchscopes的框架，并展示了如何使用它来回答关于LLM计算的各种研究问题。我们表明，先前基于将表示投影到词汇空间和干预LLM计算的可解释性方法，可以看作是该框架的特殊实例。此外，通过Patchscope可以弥补优势，如检查早期层失败或表达能力不足。除了统一先前的检查技术，Patchscopes还开辟了新的可能性，例如使用更强大的模型来解释较小模型的表示。",
