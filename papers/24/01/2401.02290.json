    "translated_abstract": "近年来，图神经网络（GNNs）通过建模实体和关系的交互在知识图谱补全（KGC）任务中取得了巨大成功。然而，对预测结果的解释却没有得到必要的关注。对基于GNN的KGC模型结果进行适当解释，可以增加模型的透明度，并帮助研究人员开发更可靠的模型。现有的KGC解释方法主要依赖于实例/子图的方法，而在某些场景下，路径可以提供更友好和可解释的解释。然而，还没有对生成基于路径的知识图谱解释方法进行充分探索。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了Power-Link，这是第一个探索基于路径的KGC解释器。我们设计了一种新颖的图加权技术，使得可以以完全可并行化和内存高效的训练方案生成基于路径的解释。我们还引入了三个新的度量指标，用于评估解释的质量和有效性。",
