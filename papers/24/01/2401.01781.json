    "abstract": "The proliferation of low-quality online information in today's era has underscored the need for robust and automatic mechanisms to evaluate the trustworthiness of online news publishers. In this paper, we analyse the trustworthiness of online news media outlets by leveraging a dataset of 4033 news stories from 40 different sources. We aim to infer the trustworthiness level of the source based on the classification of individual articles' content. The trust labels are obtained from NewsGuard, a journalistic organization that evaluates news sources using well-established editorial and publishing criteria. The results indicate that the classification model is highly effective in classifying the trustworthiness levels of the news articles. This research has practical applications in alerting readers to potentially untrustworthy news sources, assisting journalistic organizations in evaluating new or unfamiliar media outlets and supporting the selection of articles for their trustworthiness ",

    "translated_abstract": "当今信息时代低质量的在线信息泛滥，强调了需要强大而自动的机制来评估在线新闻发布者的可信度。本文通过利用来自40个不同来源的4033条新闻故事的数据集，分析在线新闻媒体机构的可信度。我们的目标是根据个别文章的内容分类来推断来源的可信度水平。可信度标签来自NewsGuard，一个通过识别新闻来源使用良好的编辑和出版标准的新闻组织。结果表明，分类模型在分类新闻文章的可信度水平方面非常有效。这项研究在提醒读者可能不可信的新闻来源、协助新闻组织评估新的或不熟悉的媒体机构以及支持选择具有可信度的文章方面具有实际应用价值。",
