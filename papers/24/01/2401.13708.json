    "translated_abstract": "在各个领域中，理解层次化或高维数据的结构是必要的。双曲空间已经被证明是一种重要的嵌入计算和分析工具，因为它们的非线性特性很适合处理树状或图形数据。因此，它们也被用于高维数据的可视化，其中它们表现出更好的嵌入性能。然而，现有的嵌入到双曲空间的降维方法都不能很好地处理输入数据的规模扩展问题。这是因为嵌入是通过迭代优化方案计算的，而每次迭代的计算成本与输入规模的平方成正比。此外，由于双曲空间的非线性特性，欧几里德加速结构不能直接转化为双曲设置。本文介绍了第一个用于双曲嵌入加速的结构，基于极坐标四叉树。我们将其应用于t-SNE算法，提出了加速双曲线t-SNE算法。",
