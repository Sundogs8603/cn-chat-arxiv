    "abstract": "Interpreting the observations of exoplanet atmospheres to constrain physical and chemical properties is typically done using Bayesian retrieval techniques. Because these methods require many model computations, a compromise is made between model complexity and run time. Reaching this compromise leads to the simplification of many physical and chemical processes (e.g. parameterised temperature structure). Here we implement and test sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE), a machine learning inference algorithm, for exoplanet atmospheric retrievals. The goal is to speed up retrievals so they can be run with more computationally expensive atmospheric models, such as those computing the temperature structure using radiative transfer. We generate 100 synthetic observations using ARCiS (ARtful Modeling Code for exoplanet Science, an atmospheric modelling code with the flexibility to compute models in varying degrees of complexity) and perform retrievals on them to test the faithfulness",

    "translated_abstract": "一般使用贝叶斯召回技术来解释外行星大气观测结果以约束物理和化学性质，但这些方法需要大量模型计算，因此需要在模型复杂性和运行时间之间做出妥协。为了加快召回速度，本研究实现并测试了顺序神经后验估计（SNPE），一种机器学习推断算法，用于外行星大气召回。通过生成100个合成观测结果，并利用这些结果进行召回测试，旨在使用计算温度结构的辐射传输模型等更复杂的大气模型来提升召回速度。",
