    "abstract": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays an important role in our daily lives, particularly due to the enormous progress of Large Language Models (LLM). However, NLP has many fairness-critical use cases, e.g., as an expert system in recruitment or as an LLM-based tutor in education. Since NLP is based on human language, potentially harmful biases can diffuse into NLP systems and produce unfair results, discriminate against minorities or generate legal issues. Hence, it is important to develop a fairness certification for NLP approaches. We follow a qualitative research approach towards a fairness certification for NLP. In particular, we have reviewed a large body of literature on algorithmic fairness, and we have conducted semi-structured expert interviews with a wide range of experts from that area. We have systematically devised six fairness criteria for NLP, which can be further refined into 18 sub-categories. Our criteria offer a foundation for operationalizing and testing processes",

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理（NLP）在我们的日常生活中扮演着重要角色，特别是由于大型语言模型（LLM）的巨大进展。然而，NLP在招聘等公平关键应用场景中存在许多问题，例如作为专家系统或基于LLM的教育导师。由于NLP基于人类语言，可能会导致潜在的有害偏见渗入NLP系统，产生不公平的结果，歧视少数群体或引发法律问题。因此，开展NLP方法的公平性认证非常重要。我们采用定性研究方法，对算法公平性的大量文献进行了综述，并与该领域的多位专家进行了半结构化的专家访谈。我们系统地提出了NLP的六个公平性标准，并进一步细化为18个子类别。我们的标准为实施和测试过程提供了基础。",
