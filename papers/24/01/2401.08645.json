    "translated_abstract": "在建筑设计评估中，金融指标仅限于成本绩效。在这里，我介绍了一种方法，自动化设计评估（ADA），用于预测在当地城市背景下生成的建筑设计概念的市场价格。将ADA与3D建筑性能模拟相结合，可以进行超出以前工作空间分辨率的财务影响评估。在综合影响评估中，ADA测量城市发展的直接和局部效应。为了证明其实用性，我研究了由于附近发展导致的当地贬值风险，这与视觉景观质量的变化有关。结果揭示了设施与财产价值之间的关系，识别出物业簇与当地土地利用变化存在物理暴露或财务敏感性。除了作为财务敏感性工具的应用外，ADA还可以作为建筑设计优化程序的蓝图，其中经济绩效是中心。",
