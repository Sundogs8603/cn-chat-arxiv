    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种稳健的假设检验程序，用于评估可能存在高持久性的多个预测变量的可预测性。我们的方法在改进了流行的扩展工具变量 (IVX) 检验 (Phillips和Lee, 2013; Kostakis等, 2015) 的基础上，不仅解决了Hosseinkouchack和Demetrescu (2021)中发现的两种偏差效应，还发现并处理了方差扩大效应。我们表明，两类高阶项导致了这些畸变效应的发生，从而在单边检验和多元预测回归中导致了显著的超级拒绝。我们改进的基于IVX的检验包括三个步骤，以解决有限样本偏差和方差项的所有问题。因此，这种改进的检验统计量在尺寸控制方面表现出色，而其功率性能与原始IVX相当。通过蒙特卡罗模拟和对债券风险溢价的经验研究，我们展示了该方法的有效性。",
