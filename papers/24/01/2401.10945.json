    "translated_abstract": "目前车辆动力学估计技术通常存在一个共同的缺点：每个要估计的变量都是用独立的简化滤波模块计算的。这些模块并行运行并需要单独校准。为了解决这个问题，最近提出了一种统一的Twin-in-the-Loop(TiL)观测器架构：估计器中的经典简化控制取向车辆模型被一个完整的车辆模拟器或数字双胞胎(DT)替代。DT的状态通过线性时不变的输出误差定律实时校正。由于模拟器是一个黑盒子，没有明确的分析公式可用，因此无法使用经典的滤波器调节技术。出于这个原因，贝叶斯优化将用于解决一个数据驱动的优化问题来调节滤波器。由于DT的复杂性，优化问题是高维的。本文旨在找到一种调节高复杂度观测器的流程。",
