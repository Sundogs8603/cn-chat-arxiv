    "abstract": "Speech has long been a barrier to effective communication and connection, persisting as a challenge in our increasingly interconnected world. This research paper introduces a transformative solution to this persistent obstacle an end-to-end speech conversion framework tailored for Hindi-to-English translation, culminating in the synthesis of English audio. By integrating cutting-edge technologies such as XLSR Wav2Vec2 for automatic speech recognition (ASR), mBART for neural machine translation (NMT), and a Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis component, this framework offers a unified and seamless approach to cross-lingual communication. We delve into the intricate details of each component, elucidating their individual contributions and exploring the synergies that enable a fluid transition from spoken Hindi to synthesized English audio.",

    "translated_abstract": "长期以来，语音一直是有效沟通和连接的障碍，在我们日益互联的世界中仍然具有挑战性。这篇研究论文介绍了一种针对印地语到英语翻译量身定制的端到端语音转换框架，最终实现了英文音频的合成。通过整合XLSR Wav2Vec2用于自动语音识别（ASR），mBART用于神经机器翻译（NMT），以及一个文本到语音（TTS）合成组件等尖端技术，该框架提供了一种统一而无缝的跨语言交流方式。我们深入研究了每个组件的复杂细节，阐明了它们的个别贡献，并探讨了相互之间的协同作用，从而实现从印地语口语到合成英文音频的流畅过渡。",
