Assessing the interpretability-faithfulness of these explanations, termed self-explanations, is challenging as the models are too complex for humans to annotate what is a correct explanation. To address this, we propose employing self-consistency checks as a measure of faithfulness. For example, if an LLM says a set of words is important for making a prediction, then it should not be able to make the same prediction without these words. While self-consistency checks are a common approach to faithfulness, they have not previously been applied to LLM's self-explanations. We apply self-consistency checks to t",

    "translated_abstract": "经过训练的大型语言模型在许多任务上表现出色，甚至能够提供其行为的解释。由于这些模型对公众是直接可访问的，因此存在这样的风险，即令人信服但错误的解释可能导致对大型语言模型的无支撑的自信。因此，解释能力和可靠性是AI安全的重要考虑因素。评估自我解释的可靠性和可解释性是一项具有挑战性的任务，因为这些模型对于人类来说过于复杂，无法注释什么是正确的解释。为了解决这个问题，我们提出使用自洽性检测作为可靠性的衡量指标。例如，如果一个大型语言模型说某组词对于做出预测很重要，那么在没有这些词的情况下，它应该无法做出相同的预测。虽然自洽性检测是一种常见的可靠性方法，但之前尚未应用于大型语言模型的自我解释中。我们将自洽性检测应用于...",
