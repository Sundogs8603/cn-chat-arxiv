    "translated_abstract": "声音事件定位和检测(SELD)是机器听觉中的一个重要任务。主要的进展依赖于在特定房间中具有声音事件和强时空标签的模拟数据。SELD数据通过将空间定位的房间冲激响应（RIRs）与声波形进行卷积来模拟，以将声音事件放置在声景中。然而，RIRs需要在特定房间中手动收集。我们提出了SpatialScaper，一个用于SELD数据模拟和增强的库。与现有工具相比，SpatialScaper通过参数（如大小和墙面吸收）模拟虚拟房间。这允许对前景和背景声源进行参数化放置（包括移动）。SpatialScaper还包括可应用于现有SELD数据的数据增强流水线。作为一个案例研究，我们使用SpatialScaper向DCASE SELD数据中添加了房间。使用我们的数据训练模型导致了随着声学多样性的直接提高的渐进性能改进。",
