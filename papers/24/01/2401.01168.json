    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）允许不同方共同训练一个全局模型，而不需要透露各自的本地标签。FL的关键步骤之一是将本地模型聚合成全局模型，这与公共决策，尤其是选举，有很多相似之处。在这种情况下，FL的一个主要弱点是其易受污染攻击的脆弱性，可以解释为现代聚合规则中“一人一票”原则（即1p1v）的后果。本文提出了FedQV，这是一个基于二次投票机制的新型聚合算法，该机制最近被提出作为1p1v选举的更好替代方案。我们的理论分析表明，FedQV是一个真实机制，根据自己的真实估值进行投标是一个占主导地位的策略，其收敛速率与现有方法相匹配。此外，我们使用多个真实数据集进行的实证分析...",
