    "translated_abstract": "预测未来股票趋势对于学术界和工业界来说仍然具有挑战性，因为随机的股票间动态和层次性股票内部动态影响股票价格。近年来，图神经网络通过将多个股票构建为图结构的数据，在此问题上取得了显著的性能。然而，大多数这些方法依赖于人工定义的因素来构建静态股票图，无法捕捉迅速演变的股票间内在相互依赖关系。此外，这些方法通常忽视了股票的层次特征，并丢失了其中的特殊信息。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的图学习方法，无需专家知识来解决这些问题。首先，我们的方法从信号处理的角度自动构建动态股票图，通过基于熵的边生成。然后，我们通过广义图传播进一步学习股票之间的任务最优依赖关系。",
