    "translated_abstract": "经济和金融时间序列在形成泡沫时可能会表现出局部爆发行为。经济或金融泡沫，特别是其动力学，是一个引人入胜的话题，一直以来都受到关注。为了说明局部爆发本身的动力学，本文提出了一个新颖、简单而有用的时间序列模型，称为随机非线性自回归模型，具有严格平稳性和几何遍历性，并能够产生在许多宏观经济变量中观察到的长周期波动或持久性。当非线性自回归系数在某一范围之外时，该模型会出现周期性爆发行为，并可以用来描绘泡沫的动态。此外，对我们的模型进行了准最大似然估计（QMLE），并在对创新采取最小假设的情况下，证明了其强一致性和渐近正态性。还针对模型拟合进行了新的模型诊断检验统计量的开发。",
