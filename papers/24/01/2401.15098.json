    "translated_abstract": "连续强化学习（Continual Reinforcement Learning, CRL）赋予强化学习智能体从一系列任务中学习的能力，保留先前的知识并利用它来促进未来的学习。然而，现有的方法往往专注于在类似任务之间传输低层次的知识，忽视了人类认知控制的层次结构，导致在各种任务之间的知识迁移不足。为了增强高层次的知识迁移，我们提出了一种名为Hi-Core (Hierarchical knowledge transfer for Continual reinforcement learning)的新框架，它由两层结构组成：1) 利用大型语言模型（Large Language Model, LLM）的强大推理能力设定目标的高层策略制定和2) 通过强化学习按照高层目标导向的低层策略学习。此外，构建了一个知识库（策略库）来存储可以用于层次化知识迁移的策略。在MiniGr实验中进行了实验。",

The framework includes high-level policy formulation utilizing the reasoning ability of a large language model to set goals, and low-level policy learning guided by high-level goals through reinforcement learning. Experimental results demonstrate the strong knowledge transfer capability of Hi-Core."
