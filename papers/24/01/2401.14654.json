    "abstract": "This paper introduces a Korean legal judgment prediction (LJP) dataset for insurance disputes. Successful LJP models on insurance disputes can benefit insurance companies and their customers. It can save both sides' time and money by allowing them to predict how the result would come out if they proceed to the dispute mediation process. As is often the case with low-resource languages, there is a limitation on the amount of data available for this specific task. To mitigate this issue, we investigate how one can achieve a good performance despite the limitation in data. In our experiment, we demonstrate that Sentence Transformer Fine-tuning (SetFit, Tunstall et al., 2022) is a good alternative to standard fine-tuning when training data are limited. The models fine-tuned with the SetFit approach on our data show similar performance to the Korean LJP benchmark models (Hwang et al., 2022) despite the much smaller data size.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种面向保险争议的韩国法律判决预测（LJP）数据集。成功预测保险争议的LJP模型可以使保险公司及其客户受益。它可以通过预测如果进行争议调解过程，结果将如何出现来节省双方的时间和金钱。正如低资源语言经常面临的情况一样，该特定任务的可用数据量有限。为了缓解这个问题，我们研究了如何在数据有限的情况下实现良好的性能。在我们的实验中，我们证明了句子转换器微调（SetFit）（Tunstall等，2022）是在数据有限的情况下的标准微调的良好替代方法。使用SetFit方法在我们的数据上进行微调的模型与韩国LJP基准模型（Hwang等，2022）在性能上显示出相似的表现，尽管数据规模要小得多。",
