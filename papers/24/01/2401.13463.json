    "translated_abstract": "口语问答(SQA)是机器通过在给定口语段落中找到答案范围来回答用户问题的关键。过去的SQA方法没有使用ASR，以避免识别错误和词汇外问题。然而，实际的开放领域SQA(openSQA)问题中，机器需要首先从口语存档中检索可能包含答案的段落。本文提出了第一个已知的用于openSQA问题检索组件的端到端框架SpeechDPR。SpeechDPR通过从无监督ASR(UASR)和文本密集检索器(TDR)的级联模型中提炼知识，学习句子级语义表示。不需要手动转录的语音数据。初步实验表明，与级联的UASR和TDR模型相比，性能相当，并且在UASR性能较差时显著提高，验证了这种方法更加鲁棒。",
