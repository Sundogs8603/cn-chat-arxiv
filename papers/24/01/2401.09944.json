    "translated_abstract": "实时高分辨率的风预测对于包括有人和无人航空在内的各种应用都很有益。当前的天气模型需要太多的计算，并且缺乏必要的预测能力，因为它们仅在多千米和几小时的尺度上有效 - 这远低于这些应用所需的空间和时间分辨率。我们的工作首次展示了在有限计算设备上实时预测低空风的能力，仅使用稀疏的测量数据训练了名为WindSeer的神经网络。我们使用计算流体力学模拟的合成数据进行训练，并展示它可以成功地从仅有少量的噪声和空间聚集的风测量数据中预测出已知地形上的真实风场。WindSeer可以在之前未见过的地形上以不同的分辨率和域大小生成准确的预测结果，无需重新训练。我们证明了该模型成功预测了历史风场。",
