    "abstract": "The exponential growth of social media has profoundly transformed how information is created, disseminated, and absorbed, exceeding any precedent in the digital age. Regrettably, this explosion has also spawned a significant increase in the online abuse of memes. Evaluating the negative impact of memes is notably challenging, owing to their often subtle and implicit meanings, which are not directly conveyed through the overt text and imagery. In light of this, large multimodal models (LMMs) have emerged as a focal point of interest due to their remarkable capabilities in handling diverse multimodal tasks. In response to this development, our paper aims to thoroughly examine the capacity of various LMMs (e.g. GPT-4V) to discern and respond to the nuanced aspects of social abuse manifested in memes. We introduce the comprehensive meme benchmark, GOAT-Bench, comprising over 6K varied memes encapsulating themes such as implicit hate speech, sexism, and cyberbullying, etc. Utilizing GOAT-Be",

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体的指数级增长深刻改变了信息的创造、传播和吸收方式，在数字时代产生了前所未有的影响。遗憾的是，这个爆炸也导致了网络迷因的滥用数量显著增加。评估迷因的负面影响是相当具有挑战性的，因为它们通常具有微妙和隐晦的含义，这些含义不能直接通过显性的文本和图像传达出来。鉴于此，大型多模态模型(LMMs)作为处理多样化多模态任务的卓越能力的焦点引起了人们的兴趣。针对这一发展，我们的论文旨在深入研究各种LMMs(如GPT-4V)识别和回应迷因中体现的微妙社交虐待方面的能力。我们引入了综合的迷因基准测试集GOAT-Bench，其中包含超过6K个多样的迷因，涵盖的主题包括隐性仇恨言论、性别歧视和网络欺凌等。利用GOAT-Be",
