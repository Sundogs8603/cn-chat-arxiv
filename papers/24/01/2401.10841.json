    "translated_abstract": "网络仇恨言论的蔓延给社交媒体平台带来了一个难题。一个特殊的挑战与使用编码语言的群体有关，这些群体既想为其用户创造归属感，又想回避检测。编码语言发展迅速，并且随着时间的推移使用方式不同。本文提出了一种检测新出现的编码恶意术语的方法论。该方法在在线反犹太言论的环境中进行了测试。该方法考虑了从社交媒体平台上抓取的帖子，通常是极端主义用户使用的。帖子是使用与以前已知的针对犹太人的仇恨言论相关的种子表达式进行抓取的。该方法首先通过识别每个帖子最具代表性的表达式，并计算它们在整个语料库中的频率。过滤掉语法不一致的表达式和之前遇到过的表达式，以便关注新出现的良好形式的术语。然后进行了语义评估。",
