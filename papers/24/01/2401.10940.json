    "abstract": "In the era of information proliferation, discerning the credibility of news content poses an ever-growing challenge. This paper introduces RELIANCE, a pioneering ensemble learning system designed for robust information and fake news credibility evaluation. Comprising five diverse base models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Networks (BiLSTMs), RELIANCE employs an innovative approach to integrate their strengths, harnessing the collective intelligence of the ensemble for enhanced accuracy. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of RELIANCE over individual models, indicating its efficacy in distinguishing between credible and non-credible information sources. RELIANCE, also surpasses baseline models in information and news credibility assessment, establishing itself as an effective solution for evaluating the reliability of information sources.",

    "translated_abstract": "在信息泛滥的时代，辨别新闻内容的可信度越来越具有挑战性。本文介绍了RELIANCE，这是一个专为鲁棒信息和虚假新闻可信度评估而设计的先进的集成学习系统。RELIANCE由五个不同的基本模型组成，包括支持向量机（SVM）、朴素贝叶斯、逻辑回归、随机森林和双向长短期记忆网络（BiLSTMs）。RELIANCE采用了创新的方法来整合它们的优势，利用集成的智能提高准确性。实验证明了RELIANCE在区分可信和不可信信息源方面的优越性，表明其在信息和新闻可信度评估方面超过了单个模型，并成为评估信息源可靠性的有效解决方案。",
    "tldr": "RELIANCE是一个可靠的集成学习系统，用于评估信息和新闻的可信度。它通过整合多个基本模型的优势，提供了对可信和不可信信息源的准确区分，并在信息和新闻可信度评估方面优于基准模型。",
    "en_tdlr": "RELIANCE is a reliable ensemble learning system for evaluating the credibility of information and news. By integrating the strengths of multiple base models, it provides accurate distinction between credible and non-credible information sources, surpassing baseline models in information and news credibility assessment."
