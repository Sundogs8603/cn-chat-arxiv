    "translated_abstract": "检索模型旨在选择与给定用户偏好匹配的一小组物品候选者。它们在大规模推荐系统中起着重要作用，因为后续的模型（如排名器）高度依赖于物品候选者的质量。然而，大多数现有的检索模型采用单轮推理范例，可能无法充分捕捉用户偏好的动态性并固定在物品空间的某个区域。在本文中，我们提出了Ada-Retrieval，一种适用于推荐系统的自适应多轮检索范例，通过迭代地改进用户表示来更好地捕捉完整的物品空间中的潜在候选者。Ada-Retrieval包含两个关键模块：物品表示适配器和用户表示适配器，旨在将上下文信息注入物品和用户的表示中。该框架具有模型无关的设计，可以与各种基础模型（如RNN或Transformer）无缝集成。",
