    "translated_abstract": "在真实世界的应用中，目标检测器经常会遇到新类别的目标实例，并且需要有效地适应它们。先前的工作将这个关键问题形式化为增量目标检测 (IOD)，假设新类别的目标实例在增量数据中是完全注释的。然而，由于监督信号通常很稀少和昂贵，监督式的增量目标检测在实际实施中可能不切实际。在这项工作中，我们考虑了一个更现实的设定，称为半监督增量目标检测 (SSIOD)，其中目标检测器需要从少量标注数据和大量未标注数据中逐渐学习新的类别，同时不对旧类别产生灾难性遗忘。一种常用的监督式IOD策略是鼓励当前模型（作为学生）模仿旧模型（作为老师）的行为，但在SSIOD中通常失败，因为大部分来自旧类别和新类别的目标实例是共存且未标注的，只有老师模型可以提供少量的监督信号。",
