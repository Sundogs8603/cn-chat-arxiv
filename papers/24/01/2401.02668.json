    "translated_abstract": "高性能的生成式人工智能（GAI）代表了计算智能的最新演变，而未来的6G网络的发展潜力也使得边缘智能（EI）充满了发展机会。GAI和EI的必然相遇可以释放新的机会，GAI基于大量计算资源和大规模未标记的语料库的预训练可以为EI提供强大的基础知识，而EI可以利用碎片化的计算资源来汇总个性化的知识为GAI所用。然而，这些自然的矛盾特点给直接的知识共享提出了重大挑战。为了应对这个问题，在本文中，我们提出了面向GAI的综合网络（GaisNet），这是一个协作的云端边缘智能框架，通过利用无数据知识中继来缓解矛盾，其中双向的知识流使得GAI的循环模型微调和任务推理成为可能，实现了GAI和EI的互利关系。",
