    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种方法，用于构建适用于敏捷飞行器在广泛的平衡条件和飞行器模型参数下可以泛化的数据驱动机动生成模型。机动生成模型在飞行器原型的测试和评估中起着关键作用，能够提供关于飞行器的机动性和敏捷性的见解。然而，构建这些模型通常需要大量的真实飞行员数据，这可能耗时且昂贵。此外，使用有限数据构建的模型往往难以在原始数据集所包含的特定飞行条件之外进行泛化。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种混合架构，利用一个称为源模型的仿真模型。这个开源敏捷飞行器模拟器与目标飞行器具有相似的动力学特性，并允许我们生成无限的数据来构建代理机动生成模型。然后，我们对该模型进行微调。",
