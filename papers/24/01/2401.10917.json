Manually preparing and writing a systematic literature review (SLR) takes considerable time and effort, since it requires planning a strategy, conducting the literature search and analysis, and reporting the findings. Depending on the area under study, the number of papers retrieved can be of hundreds or thousands, meaning that filtering those relevant ones and extracting the key information becomes a costly and error-prone process. However, some of the involved tasks are repetitive and, therefore, subject to automation by means of AI. In this paper, we present a survey",

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）在现代计算中变得非常重要，因为它可以有效地解决人们传统上完成的复杂任务。AI提供了表示和推理知识、高效地处理文本和从大量数据中学习的方法。这些特点适用于许多人类找到费力或重复的活动，比如科学文献的分析。手动准备和撰写系统文献综述（SLR）需要相当长的时间和努力，因为它需要策划一个策略，进行文献搜索和分析，并报告结果。根据研究领域的不同，检索到的论文数量可能达到数百或数千篇，这意味着过滤出相关文献并提取关键信息是一个昂贵且容易出错的过程。然而，一些涉及的任务是重复的，因此可以通过AI自动化。在本文中，我们提出了一项调查研究",
