In our experiments we observed that such a model is prone to mis-labeling the source entities, which can often appear in the text, as the target entities. To alleviate this problem, we propose a model to transfer the knowledge from the source domain to the target domain, however, at the same time, to project the source entities and target entities into separate regions of the feature space.

    "translated_abstract": "命名标签是信息抽取（IE）的关键组成部分，尤其在生物医学和化学等科学领域，大型语言模型（LLM），例如ChatGPT，表现不佳。我们研究了将迁移学习应用于增强在生物医学领域（源领域）训练的命名标签模型在化学领域（目标领域）中的使用。在少样本学习设置中训练这样的模型的一种常见做法是在标记的源数据上预训练模型，然后在少量标记的目标示例上进行微调。在我们的实验中，我们观察到这样的模型容易将源实体错误标记为目标实体，因为源实体经常出现在文本中。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种模型，将知识从源领域转移到目标领域，但同时将源实体和目标实体投影到特征空间的不同区域。",
