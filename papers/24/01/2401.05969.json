    "translated_abstract": "巡警问题（TOP）是一个具有挑战性的随机优化任务。在这个问题中，一名停车员通过配备停车传感器的城市进行引导，以便尽可能多地罚款违规停车者。TOP的一个主要挑战是停车违规的动态性，这些违规行为会在一段时间后随机出现和消失，不论它们是否被罚款。因此，解决方案需要动态地调整以适应当前可罚款的停车违规行为，同时还要提前计划，增加巡警在违规行为发生时到达的可能性。尽管存在各种解决方案，但这些方法往往难以考虑到行动对未来罚款违规的能力产生的影响。本文提出了SATOP，一种新颖的空间感知深度强化学习方法用于TOP。我们的新型状态编码器创建了每个动作的表示，利用停车位、代理和动作之间的空间关系。",
