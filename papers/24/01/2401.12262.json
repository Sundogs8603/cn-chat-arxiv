    "translated_abstract": "网络安全已成为全球关注的重要问题。入侵检测系统（IDS）通过检测恶意行为和活动在保护互联网络方面发挥关键作用。基于机器学习（ML）的行为分析在IDS中具有发现动态网络威胁、识别异常和恶意行为的潜力。然而，随着数据量的增加，当训练ML模型时，降维变得越来越困难。针对这一问题，我们的论文引入了一种新颖的基于机器学习的网络入侵检测模型，该模型使用随机过采样（RO）来解决数据不平衡问题，并结合聚类结果的堆叠特征嵌入和主成分分析（PCA）进行降维，专门针对大规模和不平衡数据集。我们使用三个前沿的基准数据集（UNSW-NB15、CIC-IDS-2017和CIC-IDS）仔细评估了该模型的性能。",
