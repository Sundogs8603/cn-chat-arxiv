    "translated_abstract": "大多数现有的图神经网络（GNN）局限于无向图，其捕捉关系信息的范围受限制，限制了其表达能力和在现实场景中的部署。 相较于无向图，有向图（有向图）更适合建模更复杂的拓扑系统的需求，通过捕捉节点之间更复杂的关系，如制定交通和金融网络。 虽然已经提出了一些有向GNN，但它们的灵感主要来自深度学习架构，这导致了冗余的复杂性和计算量，使其无法应用于大规模数据库。 为解决这些问题，我们提出了一种基于磁性拉普拉斯的可扩展变种有向图卷积，LightDiC。 由于拓扑相关的计算仅在离线预处理过程中进行，LightDiC实现了出色的可扩展性，从而实现了向下的...",
