    "translated_abstract": "音频嵌入使得音频文件的相似性能够进行大规模比较，用于搜索和推荐等应用。由于音频相似性的主观性，设计能够回答音频是否相似以及相似的方式（例如，与节奏、情绪或流派相关）的系统可能更加理想。之前的研究已经提出了能够对特定属性进行加权以在后续任务中强调这些属性的分离嵌入空间。然而，关于这些子空间的独立性以及对其进行操作以检索在特定方式下相似但不同的曲目的研究尚未进行。在这里，我们探索了在嵌入空间中操作节奏作为这个目标的一个案例研究。我们提出了节奏转换函数，可以在现有嵌入空间中高效地操作节奏，同时保持流派等其他属性。",
    "tldr": "通过在音频嵌入中操作节奏，本研究实现了在维持其他属性不变的情况下，检索出在节奏上相似但在其他方面不同的音乐曲目。"
