The performance of this sector has an overwhelming impact on the primary macroeconomic objectives like food security, employment generation, poverty alleviation, human resources development, and other economic and social forces. Although Bangladesh's labor-intensive agriculture has achieved steady increases in food grain production, it often suffered from unfavorable weather conditions such as heavy rainfall, low temperature, and drought. Consequently, these factors hinder the production of food substantially, putting the country's overall food security in danger. In order to have a profitable, sustainable, and farmer-friendly agricultural practice, this paper proposes a context-based crop recommendation system powered by a weather forecast model. Wi",

    "translated_abstract": "孟加拉国主要是一个农业国家，农业部门对于加快经济增长和保障人民粮食安全起着至关重要的作用。虽然孟加拉国劳动密集型农业取得了粮食产量稳步增长，但常常受到不利天气条件的影响，如暴雨、低温和干旱。因此，这些因素严重影响了粮食生产，使得国家的粮食安全受到威胁。为了实现盈利、可持续且农民友好的农业实践，本文提出了一种基于天气预测模型的基于上下文的作物推荐系统。",
