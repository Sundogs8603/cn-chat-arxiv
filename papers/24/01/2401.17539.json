We introduce the underlying methodology, emphasizing its relationship with generative diffusion models and the previously introduced F\\\"ollmer sampler. We demonstrate the efficacy of ensemble strategies through various examples, ranging from low- to medium-dimensionality sampling problems, including multi-modal and highly non-Gaussian probability distributions, and provide comparisons to traditional methods like NUTS.

    "translated_abstract": "我们在基于分数的抽样方法中引入了集成方法，以开发利用粒子集合动态计算近似反扩散漂移的无梯度抽样技术。我们介绍了底层方法，并强调它与生成扩散模型和先前介绍的Föllmer抽样器的关系。我们通过各种示例证明了集成策略的有效性，涵盖了从低维到中等维度的抽样问题，包括多峰和高度非高斯概率分布，并与传统方法如NUTS进行比较。我们的发现突出了在梯度不可用的情况下，集成策略在建模复杂概率分布方面的潜力。最后，我们展示了在地球物理科学的贝叶斯反演问题中的应用。",
