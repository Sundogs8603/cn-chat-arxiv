    "translated_abstract": "社会工程旨在欺骗用户执行可能损害其安全和隐私的行动。这些威胁利用了人类决策过程中的弱点，使用各种策略，如借口、诱饵、冒充等。在网络上，社会工程攻击包括惊吓软件、技术支持诈骗、调查诈骗、抽奖活动等攻击类别，可能导致敏感数据泄露、恶意软件感染和财务损失。例如，美国消费者每年因各种社会工程攻击而损失数十亿美元。不幸的是，与软件漏洞和利用、网络入侵、恶意软件和钓鱼等重要威胁相比，通用的社会工程攻击研究仍然不足。现有的少数几项技术研究主要侧重于测量而不是开发通用防御措施。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了SEShield，这是一个用于在浏览器中检测社会工程攻击的框架。",
