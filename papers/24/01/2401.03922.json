    "translated_abstract": "阿尔茨海默病（AD）作为主要的痴呆形式，对全球构成了一个不断增长的挑战，并强调了准确和早期诊断的紧迫性。临床技术中，放射科医生在使用磁共振成像（MRI）区分轻度认知障碍（MCI）和AD时遇到了困难，因为这些方法不一致且不可靠。已经证明，机器学习有望提供早期AD诊断的可能性。然而，现有的模型主要关注细粒度的局部特征，而没有考虑到可以提供大脑皮层神经退行信息的局部结构特征。因此，本文提出了一种机器学习（ML）框架，该框架集成了Gamma校正（一种图像增强技术），并使用一种名为SNeurodCNN的结构化神经退行性卷积神经网络（CNN）架构，用于区分AD和MCI。该ML框架利用了中矢状面和旁矢状面的大脑图像视点。",
