We parse these histories to both extract the structure of the network and model the nuanced ways in which information is shared and spread among its members.

    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了一个仿真框架，将代理建模和自然语言处理技术相结合，研究在线社交网络中的误信息传播。虽然在这个领域中存在许多其他的代理建模仿真，但它们在提供可操作的见解方面受限于其对现有网络的真实性和普适性的不足。为了部分解决这些问题，我们通过下载超过一万名用户的社交媒体历史记录，创建了一个已知误信息共享网络的“数字克隆”。我们解析这些历史记录，提取出网络的结构，并对成员之间信息分享和传播的微妙方式进行建模。与这个领域中许多其他的代理建模方法不同，我们框架中用户之间的信息分享对讨论主题、用户偏好和在线社区动态都非常敏感。为了评估我们方法的真实性，我们用一组记录在 t 中的帖子对克隆网络进行了种子设置。",
