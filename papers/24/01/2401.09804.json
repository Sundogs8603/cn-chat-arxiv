    "translated_abstract": "在线内容平台普遍使用基于参与度的优化策略来进行推荐。这鼓励内容创作者投资于质量，但也会奖励使用点击驱动等战术。为了了解对内容格局的总体影响，我们研究了内容创作者基于参与指标竞争的游戏，并分析了关于质量投资和战术的均衡决策。首先，我们证明了均衡状态下创建的内容在质量和战术之间呈正相关，并在Twitter数据集上进行了实证验证。利用内容格局的均衡结构，我们还从多个方面研究了基于参与度的优化策略的下游绩效。也许逆反地，用户消费的平均内容质量在均衡状态下可能会下降，因为战术对内容创作者的成本更高。此外，基于参与度的优化策略在用户体验方面可能表现得更差。",
