    "abstract": "We present a novel method for anomaly detection in Solar System object data, in preparation for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time. We train a deep autoencoder for anomaly detection and use the learned latent space to search for other interesting objects. We demonstrate the efficacy of the autoencoder approach by finding interesting examples, such as interstellar objects, and show that using the autoencoder, further examples of interesting classes can be found. We also investigate the limits of classic unsupervised approaches to anomaly detection through the generation of synthetic anomalies and evaluate the feasibility of using a supervised learning approach. Future work should consider expanding the feature space to increase the variety of anomalies that can be uncovered during the survey using an autoencoder.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的太阳系天体数据异常检测方法，为时空遗产调查做准备。我们训练了一个深度自编码器来进行异常检测，并利用学习到的潜在空间来搜索其他有趣的天体。我们通过找到星际物体等有趣的例子来证明自编码器方法的有效性，并展示了使用自编码器可以找到更多有趣类别的例子。我们还通过生成合成异常来探究经典无监督异常检测方法的局限性，并评估了使用监督学习方法的可行性。未来的工作应考虑通过扩展特征空间来增加在调查中可以发现的异常的种类，使用自编码器。",
