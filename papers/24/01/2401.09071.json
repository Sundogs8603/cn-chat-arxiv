    "translated_abstract": "尽管谱图神经网络（GNN）在理论上在谱域中有很好的基础，但它们实际上依赖于多项式逼近，意味着它们与空间域有着深刻的联系。由于以前的研究很少从空间角度研究谱图GNN，因此它们在空间域的可解释性仍然难以捉摸，例如，谱图GNN在空间域中实际上编码了哪些信息？为了回答这个问题，本文在谱滤波和空间聚合之间建立了一个理论上的联系，揭示了谱滤波隐含地将原始图转换成适应性新图的内在交互作用，并明确地计算用于空间聚合的适应性新图。理论和经验研究表明，适应性新图不仅表现出非局部性，还能够容纳有符号的边权重以反映节点之间的标签一致性。因此，这些发现突显了谱图GNN在空间中的可解释性角色。",
