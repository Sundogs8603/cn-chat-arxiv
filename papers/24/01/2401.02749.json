    "translated_abstract": "最小贝叶斯风险解码被证明是一种在广泛的文本生成任务中替代束搜索解码的强大方法。然而，MBR需要大量的时间来计算MBR目标，这使得该方法在许多需要响应时间至关重要的情况下不可行。最近提出了基于置信度的剪枝(CBP)方法来降低机器翻译任务中的推理时间。尽管已经证明它能显著减少计算量，但是它需要使用开发集进行超参数调优才能发挥作用。为此，我们提出了一种无需超参数的近似最小贝叶斯风险（AMBR）解码方法。AMBR基于以下观察得出：计算基于样本的MBR目标的问题是中位数识别问题。AMBR使用了迭代消除法（CSH）算法，这是迄今为止最好的近似算法。",
