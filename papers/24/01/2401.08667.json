In addition, since datasets can be often collected from different fidelity/sparsity in practice, multi-fidelity DD-PINNs are also proposed and evaluated.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究从不同角度探索了利用物理信息神经网络(PINNs)实现数字孪生(DT)的潜力。首先，研究了用于配点的各种自适应采样方法，以验证它们在无网格框架的PINNs中的有效性，该框架允许自动构建虚拟表示，无需手动生成网格。然后，检验了数据驱动的PINNs(DD-PINNs)框架的整体性能，该框架可以利用在DT场景中获得的数据集。其对参数化的Navier-Stokes方程的更一般物理性的可扩展性得到了验证，其中PINNs在雷诺数变化时无需重新训练。此外，由于实际上数据集经常可以在不同的保真度/稀疏度下收集，还提出并评估了多保真度的DD-PINNs。它们在外推任务中表现出了显著的预测性能，相对于单保真度方法提高了42％到62％。",
