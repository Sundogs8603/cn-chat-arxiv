    "abstract": "This paper proposes a two blocks and three regions economic geography model that can account for the most salient stylized facts experienced by Eastern European transition economies during the period 1990 2005. In contrast to the existing literature, which has favored technological explanations, trade liberalization is the only driving force. The model correctly predicts that in the first half of the period, trade liberalization led to divergence in GDP per capita, both between the West and the East and within the East. Consistent with the data, in the second half of the period, this process was reversed and convergence became the dominant force.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个包括两个区块和三个地区的经济地理模型，可以解释东欧转型经济体在1990年至2005年期间经历的最显著的事实。与现有文献不同，本文认为贸易自由化是唯一的推动力量，而非技术因素。该模型正确预测到在这一时期的前半段，贸易自由化导致了西部和东部以及东部内部的人均GDP的分化。与数据一致，这一过程在后半段得以逆转，收敛成为主导力量。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes an economic geography model to study the economic development trend of Eastern European transition economies from 1990 to 2005. Unlike existing literature, it finds that trade liberalization is the only driving force. The model accurately predicts the GDP convergence path in Eastern Europe."
