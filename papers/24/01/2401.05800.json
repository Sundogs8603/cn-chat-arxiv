    "translated_abstract": "对多变量时间序列数据中的异常进行检测对于各种实际应用非常重要，包括智能电网、交通流预测和工业过程控制等。然而，真实世界的时间序列数据通常不是良好结构化的，这给现有方法带来了重大挑战：（1）多变量时间序列数据中的缺失值存在于变量和时间维度，阻碍了对交织的空间和时间依赖关系进行有效建模，导致重要的模式在模型训练过程中被忽视；（2）在采样不规则的观测下进行异常评分的研究较少，这使得在多变量序列中使用现有检测器时很难处理没有完全观测值的情况。在本文中，我们介绍了一种名为GST-Pro的新框架，该框架利用图形时空过程和异常评分器来解决在采样不规则的多变量时间序列中检测异常时面临的挑战。",
