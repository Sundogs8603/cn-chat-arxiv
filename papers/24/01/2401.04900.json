    "translated_abstract": "红巨星的年龄和质量对于理解银河系的结构和演化至关重要。传统的等时线方法在估算中存在限制，因为在赫罗图中等时线重叠，而天体声学虽然更精确，但需要高精度、长期观测。为了应对这些挑战，我们开发了一种新颖的框架——光谱变换器（Spectral Transformer，SPT），通过红巨星的光谱预测其与天体声学一致的年龄和质量。SPT的关键组成部分是为光谱特别设计的多头哈达玛自注意机制，可以捕捉不同波长上的复杂关系。此外，我们引入了基于马氏距离的损失函数来解决尺度不平衡和交互模式损失，并结合了蒙特卡洛Dropout来定量分析预测的不确定性。在来自LAMOST的3,880个红巨星光谱上进行训练和测试，SPT取得了令人瞩目的年龄",
