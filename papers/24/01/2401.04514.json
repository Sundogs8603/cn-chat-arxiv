    "translated_abstract": "在代码搜索中，生成增强检索（GAR）框架是一种有前景的策略，通过生成示例代码片段来增强查询，以解决代码片段和自然语言查询之间的主要模态不匹配问题，尤其是在大型语言模型（LLM）展示了代码生成能力的情况下。然而，我们的初步调查发现，LLM增强框架所提供的改进有一定的限制。这种限制可能是因为生成的代码，尽管在功能上准确，但在代码库中与基准代码之间经常显示出明显的风格偏差。在本文中，我们扩展了基础GAR框架，并提出了一种简单而有效的方法，通过对代码库中的代码进行重写（ReCo）来进行风格规范化。实验结果表明，ReCo显著提高了检索准确性。",
