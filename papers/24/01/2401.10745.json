    "abstract": "Given the success of ChatGPT, LaMDA and other large language models (LLMs), there has been an increase in development and usage of LLMs within the technology sector and other sectors. While the level in which LLMs has not reached a level where it has surpassed human intelligence, there will be a time when it will. Such LLMs can be referred to as advanced LLMs. Currently, there are limited usage of ethical artificial intelligence (AI) principles and guidelines addressing advanced LLMs due to the fact that we have not reached that point yet. However, this is a problem as once we do reach that point, we will not be adequately prepared to deal with the aftermath of it in an ethical and optimal way, which will lead to undesired and unexpected consequences. This paper addresses this issue by discussing what ethical AI principles and guidelines can be used to address highly advanced LLMs.",

    "translated_abstract": "鉴于ChatGPT、LaMDA和其他大型语言模型（LLMs）的成功，技术行业和其他行业对LLMs的开发和使用有所增加。虽然LLMs的水平尚未超过人类智能，但总有一天会达到这一点。这种LLMs可以称为高级LLMs。目前，由于尚未达到这一点，使用道德人工智能（AI）原则和指南来解决高级LLMs的问题还受到限制。然而，这是一个问题，因为一旦达到这一点，我们将无法充分准备好以道德和最佳方式处理其产生的后果，这将导致不可预期的后果。本文讨论了如何利用道德人工智能原则和指南来解决高级LLMs的问题。",
