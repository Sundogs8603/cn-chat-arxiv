    "abstract": "Imitation learning enables robots to learn and replicate human behavior from training data. Recent advances in machine learning enable end-to-end learning approaches that directly process high-dimensional observation data, such as images. However, these approaches face a critical challenge when processing data from multiple modalities, inadvertently ignoring data with a lower correlation to the desired output, especially when using short sampling periods. This paper presents a useful method to address this challenge, which amplifies the influence of data with a relatively low correlation to the output by inputting the data into each neural network layer. The proposed approach effectively incorporates diverse data sources into the learning process. Through experiments using a simple pick-and-place operation with raw images and joint information as input, significant improvements in success rates are demonstrated even when dealing with data from short sampling periods.",

    "translated_abstract": "模仿学习使得机器人能够通过训练数据学习并复制人类行为。最近机器学习的进展使得能够直接处理高维观测数据（如图像）的端到端学习方法成为可能。然而，在处理多个模态的数据时，这些方法面临着一个关键挑战，即在使用短采样周期时无意中忽略与期望输出的相关性较低的数据。本文提出了一种有效的方法来解决这个挑战，通过将数据输入到每个神经网络层中，放大与输出相关性较低的数据的影响。所提出的方法有效地将多样的数据源纳入到学习过程中。通过使用原始图像和关节信息作为输入进行简单的拾取放置操作的实验，即使处理来自短采样周期的数据，也证明了成功率显著提高。",
