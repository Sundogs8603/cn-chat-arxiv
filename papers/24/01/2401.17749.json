    "translated_abstract": "近期，大型语言模型（LLMs）在各种探索性任务上取得了显著成就，甚至超过了历史上主导代理系统领域的传统强化学习方法的性能。本文旨在研究LLMs在星际争霸II游戏环境中执行实时战略战争任务的有效性。我们介绍了SwarmBrain，一个利用LLM在星际争霸II游戏环境中实现实时策略的具身化智能体。SwarmBrain包括两个关键组件：1）Overmind Intelligence Matrix，由最先进的LLMs驱动，旨在从高层次视角组织宏观策略。该矩阵模拟虫族智能大脑的总体意识，综合战略预见力，旨在分配资源，指导扩张和协调多线攻击。2）Swarm ReflexNet，是一个灵活的协同体，用于处理微观级别的战术决策，它通过感知环境变化和敌人动态来生成即时反应。",
