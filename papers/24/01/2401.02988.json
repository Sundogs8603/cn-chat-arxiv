    "translated_abstract": "社交网络中的众筹活动引起了广泛的关注，先前的研究关注了众筹活动的各个方面，包括项目目标、持续时间以及成功筹款的有影响力的项目类别。这些因素对于寻求捐赠者支持的企业家来说至关重要。然而，在社交网络中的慈善众筹领域仍然相对未开发，缺乏对驱动捐赠的动机的理解，这些捐赠通常缺乏具体的回报。与提供具体回报的传统众筹不同，慈善众筹依赖于无形的回报，如税收优惠、认可帖子或咨询角色。这些细节通常嵌入在众筹活动的叙述中，但对慈善众筹中文本内容的分析是有限的。本研究引入了一种创新的文本分析框架，利用潜在狄利克雷分配（LDA）从慈善活动的文本描述中提取潜在主题。",
