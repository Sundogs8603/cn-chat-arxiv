    "translated_abstract": "随着共享、连接和协作的自动驾驶车辆的出现，城市移动性正处于转型的边缘。然而，要想被客户接受，对它们的准点性的信任至关重要。许多试点项目没有固定时间表，因此可靠的到达时间（AT）预测的重要性得到了增强。本研究提出了一个针对自动穿梭巴士的AT预测系统，利用分别用于停留时间和运行时间预测的模型，并利用来自五个城市的实际数据进行验证。除了常用的方法如XGBoost外，我们还探索了使用图神经网络（GNN）集成空间数据的益处。为了准确处理穿梭巴士绕过站点的情况，我们提出了一个层次化模型，结合了随机森林分类器和GNN。最终的AT预测结果很有前景，即使预测数个站点之前也显示出较低的误差。然而，并没有单一的模型显露出普遍优势，我们提供了关于模型特征的见解。",
