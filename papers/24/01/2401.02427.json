    "abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive review of AI/ML-based direct positioning within 5G systems, focusing on its potential in challenging scenarios and conditions where conventional methods often fall short. Building upon the insights from the technical report TR38.843, we examine the Life Cycle Management (LCM) with a focus on to the aspects associated direct positioning process. We highlight significant simulation results and key observations from the report on the direct positioning under the various challenging conditions. Additionally, we discuss selected solutions that address measurement reporting, data collection, and model management, emphasizing their importance for advancing direct positioning.",
