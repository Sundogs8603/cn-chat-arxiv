    "abstract": "The Ward et al. (2016) Plos-One paper is an important, heavily-cited paper in the decoupling literature.

They find only relative decoupling has occurred, leading to their central claim that future absolute decoupling is implausible. However, the authors have made two key errors in their collected data: GDP data is in current prices which includes inflation, and their global material use data is the total mass of fossil energy materials. Strictly, GDP data should be in constant prices to allow for its comparison over time, and material inputs to an economy should be the sum of mineral raw materials. Amending for these errors, we find much smaller levels of energy-GDP relative decoupling, and no materials-GDP decoupling at all at a global level. We check these new results by adding data for 1900-1990 to provide a longer time series, and find consistent",

    "translated_abstract": "Ward et al. (2016) Plos-One论文是解耦文献中一篇重要且被广泛引用的论文。作者在世界范围内以及选定国家的1990-2015年间，提供了材料和能源消耗与GDP增长的证据。他们发现只存在相对解耦现象，导致他们的核心观点是未来的绝对解耦是不可能的。然而，作者在收集数据过程中存在两个关键错误：GDP数据使用的是当前价格，包括通货膨胀，并且他们的全球材料使用数据是化石能源材料的总质量。严格来说，GDP数据应该使用恒定价格以便在不同时期进行比较，并且经济体的物质投入应该是矿产原材料的总和。修正这些错误后，我们发现能源-GDP相对解耦的水平要小得多，并且在全球范围内没有任何材料-GDP解耦。我们通过向1900-1990年添加数据来验证这些新结果，从而提供了一个更长的时间序列，并且获得了一致的结果。",
