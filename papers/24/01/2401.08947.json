    "translated_abstract": "革命性的在线网络服务的不断依赖引入了更高的安全风险，尽管有广泛的安全措施，网络钓鱼仍然带来持续的挑战。传统的基于机器学习和手动特征的网络钓鱼系统在应对不断变化的策略上很困难。深度学习的最新进展为解决新型网络钓鱼和恶意URL挑战提供了有希望的途径。本文介绍了一种名为AntiPhishStack的两阶段堆叠泛化模型，旨在检测网络钓鱼网站。该模型对URL和字符级TF-IDF特征进行对称学习，增强了对新型网络钓鱼威胁的应对能力。第一阶段在基本的机器学习分类器上训练特征，采用K折交叉验证进行均值预测以提高鲁棒性。第二阶段采用两层堆叠LSTM网络，配合五个自适应优化器进行动态编译，确保在这些特征上获得出色的预测性能。此外，该模型使用对抗性训练策略来增加鲁棒性和对抗刚性网络钓鱼攻击。",
