    "translated_abstract": "视觉缺陷检测在智能工业中起着重要作用。基于补丁的方法将视觉图像视为根据位置的图像补丁集合，对产品中的小缺陷（如药丸上的划痕）具有更强的辨别能力。然而，查询图像和存储的补丁之间的最近邻搜索将在时间和空间需求方面占用O(n) 的复杂度，对于在边缘环境部署而言提出了严格的挑战。在本文中，我们提出了一种通过协同表示模型计算图像补丁距离的替代方法。从具有L0约束的最近邻距离开始，我们放宽约束为L2约束，并通过封闭形式快速解决距离问题，而不需要实际访问原始存储的图像补丁集合。此外，我们指出，这种封闭形式解决方案的主要计算负担可以由高性能服务器在部署前预先计算。",
