    "abstract": "Personality recognition is useful for enhancing robots' ability to tailor user-adaptive responses, thus fostering rich human-robot interactions. One of the challenges in this task is a limited number of speakers in existing dialogue corpora, which hampers the development of robust, speaker-independent personality recognition models. Additionally, accurately modeling both the interdependencies among interlocutors and the intra-dependencies within the speaker in dialogues remains a significant issue. To address the first challenge, we introduce personality trait interpolation for speaker data augmentation. For the second, we propose heterogeneous conversational graph networks to independently capture both contextual influences and inherent personality traits. Evaluations on the RealPersonaChat corpus demonstrate our method's significant improvements over existing baselines.",

    "translated_abstract": "人格识别对于增强机器人的个性化回应能力非常有用，从而促进丰富的人机交互。这一任务的一个挑战是现有对话语料库中演讲者数量有限，这阻碍了健壮的、与演讲者无关的人格识别模型的发展。此外，在对话中准确建模对话参与者之间的相互依赖和发言者内部依赖仍然是一个重要问题。为了解决第一个挑战，我们引入了人格特征插值来进行演讲者数据增强。对于第二个挑战，我们提出了异构对话图网络，可以独立地捕捉上下文影响和内在人格特征。在RealPersonaChat语料库上的评估结果表明，我们的方法相比现有基线模型具有显著的改进。",
