    "translated_abstract": "在现实世界中，许多主题之间存在相互关联，这给研究它们的结构和关系带来了挑战。了解主题之间的相互作用及其相关性可以为研究人员提供有价值的见解，指导他们的研究并确定研究的方向。在本文中，我们利用从主题模型中获得的主题-词分布作为项目响应数据，使用潜在空间项目响应模型对主题的结构进行建模。通过根据到单词的距离估计主题的潜在位置，我们可以捕捉到主题的潜在结构并揭示它们之间的关系。在欧几里得空间中可视化主题的潜在位置，可以直观地理解它们之间的接近程度和关联性。我们通过使用一种新提出的评分方案选择代表性词汇来表征主题之间的关系。此外，我们通过追踪主题的潜在位置来评估它们的成熟度。",
