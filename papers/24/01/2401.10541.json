    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络（DNN）的最新进展源于其在各个领域的出色表现。然而，其本身庞大的体积阻碍了在资源受限设备（如边缘、移动和物联网平台）上部署这些网络。从部分云计算卸载（分割计算）到在DNN层中集成提前退出，出现了各种策略。我们的工作提出了一种创新的统一方法，将提前退出与分割计算相结合。我们确定了“分割层”，即用于边缘设备计算的DNN的最佳深度，并根据准确性、计算效率和通信成本决定是在边缘设备进行推理还是在云端进行推理。此外，图像分类面临着影响因素如白天时间、照明和天气等多样的环境失真。为了适应这些失真，我们引入了I-SplitEE，这是一种适用于缺少基准的场景和具有连续性的在线无监督算法。",
