    "abstract": "Summarizing multiple disaster-relevant data streams simultaneously is particularly challenging as existing Retrieve&Re-ranking strategies suffer from the inherent redundancy of multi-stream data and limited scalability in a multi-query setting. This work proposes an online approach to crisis timeline generation based on weak annotation with Deep Q-Networks. It selects on-the-fly the relevant pieces of text without requiring neither human annotations nor content re-ranking. This makes the inference time independent of the number of input queries. The proposed approach also incorporates a redundancy filter into the reward function to effectively handle cross-stream content overlaps. The achieved ROUGE and BERTScore results are superior to those of best-performing models on the CrisisFACTS 2022 benchmark.",

    "translated_abstract": "同时总结多个与灾害相关的数据流尤其具有挑战性，因为现有的检索与重新排序策略在多流数据的固有冗余和多查询环境下的限制可扩展性方面存在问题。本文提出了一种基于弱标注和深度Q网络的在线危机时间轴生成方法。它能够实时选择相关的文本片段，无需人工标注或内容重新排序，从而使推理时间与输入查询的数量无关。该方法还将冗余过滤器融入奖励函数中，以有效处理跨流内容重叠。在CrisisFACTS 2022基准测试中，所达到的ROUGE和BERTScore结果优于最佳性能模型。",
