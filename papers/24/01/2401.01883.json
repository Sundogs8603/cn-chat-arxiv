    "translated_abstract": "防御网络攻击要求从高级对手行为入手。过去的网络攻击事件的网络威胁情报(CTI)报告描述了恶意行动的时间链。为了避免重复发生网络攻击事件，从过去的网络攻击行为中主动识别和防御重复链式行动 - 我们将其称为时间攻击模式。自动挖掘行动之间的模式提供了关于过去网络攻击的对手行为的结构化和可操作的信息。本文旨在通过从网络威胁情报报告中挖掘时间攻击模式，帮助安全从业人员优先处理和主动防御网络攻击。为此，我们提出了ChronoCTI，一个自动化的管道，用于从过去的网络威胁情报(CTI)报告中挖掘时间攻击模式。为构建ChronoCTI，我们构建了时间攻击模式的基准数据集，并应用了最先进的技术。",
