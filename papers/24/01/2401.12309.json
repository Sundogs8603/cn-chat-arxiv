    "abstract": "This note discusses the interpretation of event-study plots produced by recent difference-in-differences methods. I show that even when specialized to the case of non-staggered treatment timing, the default plots produced by software for three of the most popular recent methods (de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille, 2020; Callaway and SantAnna, 2021; Borusyak, Jaravel and Spiess, 2024) do not match those of traditional two-way fixed effects (TWFE) event-studies: the new methods may show a kink or jump at the time of treatment even when the TWFE event-study shows a straight line. This difference stems from the fact that the new methods construct the pre-treatment coefficients asymmetrically from the post-treatment coefficients. As a result, visual heuristics for analyzing TWFE event-study plots should not be immediately applied to those from these methods. I conclude with practical recommendations for constructing and interpreting event-study plots when using these methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文讨论了最新差异与差异方法产生的事件研究图的解释。我展示了即使在非错开治疗时机的情况下专门针对情况进行了特殊化，三种最流行的最新方法（de Chaisemartin和D'Haultfoeuille，2020; Callaway和SantAnna，2021; Borusyak，Jaravel和Spiess，2024）软件生成的默认图形与传统的两方式固定效应（TWFE）事件研究的图形不匹配：新方法可能在治疗时出现转折点或跳跃点，而TWFE事件研究则显示一条直线。这种差异来自于新方法将治疗前系数与治疗后系数进行不对称构建。因此，对于分析TWFE事件研究图的视觉启发，不能立即应用于这些方法的图形上。文章最后给出了在使用这些方法时构建和解释事件研究图的实用建议。",
