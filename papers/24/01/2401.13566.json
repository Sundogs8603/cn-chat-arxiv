    "abstract": "When devising recommendation services, it is important to account for the interests of all content providers, encompassing not only newcomers but also minority demographic groups. In various instances, certain provider groups find themselves underrepresented in the item catalog, a situation that can influence recommendation results. Hence, platform owners often seek to regulate the exposure of these provider groups in the recommended lists. In this paper, we propose a novel cost-sensitive approach designed to guarantee these target exposure levels in pairwise recommendation models. This approach quantifies, and consequently mitigate, the discrepancies between the volume of recommendations allocated to groups and their contribution in the item catalog, under the principle of equity. Our results show that this approach, while aligning groups exposure with their assigned levels, does not compromise to the original recommendation utility.

    "translated_abstract": "在设计推荐服务时，考虑到所有内容提供者的利益非常重要，这些提供者包括新进入者和少数民族群体。在某些情况下，特定的提供者群体在物品目录中的代表性较低，这可能会影响推荐结果。因此，平台拥有者通常希望调节这些提供者群体在推荐列表中的曝光度。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的成本敏感方法，旨在在成对推荐模型中确保这些目标曝光水平。这种方法量化并减少了分配给群体的推荐量与物品目录中的贡献之间的差异，遵循公平原则。我们的结果表明，这种方法在确保群体曝光度与其分配水平一致的同时，不会损害原始的推荐效果。可以获取源代码和预处理数据。",
