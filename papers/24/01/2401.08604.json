    "translated_abstract": "语义分割在使智能车辆理解其周围环境方面发挥着关键作用。然而，基于深度学习的方法通常在领域转移场景中表现不佳，原因是缺乏用于训练的标记数据。无监督领域自适应（UDA）技术已经出现，以弥合不同驾驶场景之间的差距，提高无标注目标环境上的模型性能。尽管自训练UDA方法已经取得了最先进的结果，但精确伪标签的生成仍然是一个挑战。这些伪标签往往偏向于多数类别，从而牺牲了罕见类别或类似交通灯和标志等小物体的性能。为了解决这个挑战，我们介绍了SAM4UDASS，一种将Segment Anything Model（SAM）结合到自训练UDA方法中以提升伪标签的新方法。它涉及语义引导的蒙版标签，通过给无标签的SAM蒙版分配语义标签来细化伪标签。",
