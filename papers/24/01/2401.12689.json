    "translated_abstract": "传统的机器学习模型评估协议依赖于标记的、假设独立同分布的测试数据集，而这在实际应用中往往并不常见。自动模型评估（AutoEval）提出了一种替代传统工作流程的方法，通过形成一个接近预测性能的测试管线，而无需真实标签的存在。尽管AutoEval框架近年来取得了一些成功，但仍存在过度自信、存储和计算成本高的问题。因此，我们提出了一种新颖的度量方式——元分布能量（MDE），它可以使AutoEval框架更加高效和有效。MDE的核心是建立一个关于个体样本相关信息（能量）的元分布统计量，然后通过基于能量的学习提供更平滑的表示能力。我们通过将MDE与分类损失相连接，进一步提供了理论洞见。我们还提供了大量实验证据来验证我们的方法。",
