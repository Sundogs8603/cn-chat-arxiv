    "abstract": "Developing the proper representations for simulating high-speed flows with strong shock waves, rarefactions, and contact discontinuities has been a long-standing question in numerical analysis. Herein, we employ neural operators to solve Riemann problems encountered in compressible flows for extreme pressure jumps (up to $10^{10}$ pressure ratio). In particular, we first consider the DeepONet that we train in a two-stage process, following the recent work of Lee and Shin, wherein the first stage, a basis is extracted from the trunk net, which is orthonormalized and subsequently is used in the second stage in training the branch net. This simple modification of DeepONet has a profound effect on its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness and leads to very accurate solutions to Riemann problems compared to the vanilla version. It also enables us to interpret the results physically as the hierarchical data-driven produced basis reflects all the flow features that would otherwise be introduce",

    "translated_abstract": "在数值分析中，如何为模拟具有强激波、稀疏化和接触间断的高速流动开发合适的表示一直是一个长期存在的问题。本文采用神经算子来解决在可压缩流中遇到的Riemann问题，其中包括极端压力跳跃（高达$10^{10}$的压力比）。特别地，在本研究中，我们首先考虑了DeepONet，它是在Lee和Shin的最新工作基础上进行的两阶段训练。在第一阶段，我们从主干网络中提取了一个基础并使其正交化，然后在第二阶段使用它来训练分支网络。这个对DeepONet的简单修改对其准确性、效率和鲁棒性有着深远影响，相比原始版本，它提供了非常准确的Riemann问题解决方案。此外，它还使我们能够在物理上对结果进行解释，因为层次化的数据驱动生成的基础反映了所有流动特征，否则将被引入。",
