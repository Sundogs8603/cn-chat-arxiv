    "translated_abstract": "我们引入一种快速精确的分析方法，利用扩散相关光谱学（DCS）和极限学习机（ELM）来分析脑血流（CBF）。我们评估了ELM和现有算法，并使用综合指标对这些算法进行了比较。我们使用合成数据集对半无穷和多层模型进行了评估。结果表明，在各种噪声水平和光学参数下，ELM始终具有更高的准确性，展示了强大的泛化能力，并优于迭代拟合算法。通过与计算效率高的神经网络进行比较，ELM获得了可比较的准确性，同时减少了训练和推理时间。值得注意的是，在ELM的训练过程中，没有反向传播过程，导致训练速度比现有的神经网络方法更快。这种提出的策略在在线训练的边缘计算应用中具有潜力。",
