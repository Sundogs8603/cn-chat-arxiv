    "translated_abstract": "该论文研究了基于子采样矩阵条目以及观察到的社交图和超图的补全评分矩阵的问题。我们证明了在样本概率上存在一个尖锐阈值，用于精确完成评分矩阵的任务，当样本概率高于阈值时，任务可完成，反之则不可能，这展示了一个相变现象。阈值可以作为超图的“质量”函数来表示，从而使我们能够量化由于超图利用而导致的样本概率减少量，这也突显了超图在矩阵补全问题中的有用性。在发现尖锐阈值的过程中，我们开发了一种计算高效的矩阵补全算法，该算法有效地利用了观察到的图和超图。理论分析表明，只要样本概率高于某个阈值，我们的算法可以高概率地成功。",

We discover a sharp threshold that allows for the exact completion of the rating matrix. By quantifying the \"quality\" of hypergraphs, we are able to evaluate the impact of hypergraph exploitation on sample probability. Additionally, we develop an efficient algorithm that successfully completes the matrix with high probability."
