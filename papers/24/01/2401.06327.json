    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种新颖的任务，称为广义关系发现（GRD），用于开放世界的关系抽取。GRD旨在通过将实例分配到簇并为这些簇提供具体含义，来识别现有预定义关系中的未标记实例或发现新的关系。GRD的主要挑战是如何减轻由标记的预定义关系造成的严重模型偏见，以学习有效的关系表示，并在对未标记实例进行分类或聚类时确定新关系的特定语义。然后，我们提出了一个新的框架SFGRD来解决上述问题，通过从半事实中学习进行两个阶段的操作。第一个阶段是通过三视图去偏见关系表示模块来实现半事实生成，其中我们将每个原始句子作为主视图，并设计两个去偏见视图来生成该句子的半事实示例。第二个阶段是半事实思考",
