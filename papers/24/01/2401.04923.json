    "translated_abstract": "主动学习是一种常用的方法，可减少训练深度神经网络所需的标记工作量。然而，当前主动学习方法的效果受到其封闭世界假设的限制，即假设未标记数据池中的所有数据来自一组预定义的已知类别。在实际情况下，这种假设通常是无效的，因为未标记数据中可能存在未知类别，导致主动开放集标注问题。数据中存在未知类别会显著影响现有主动学习方法的性能，因为其引入了不确定性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的基于数据的主动学习方法NEAT，它可以主动标注开放集数据。NEAT旨在从已知和未知类别的未标记数据池中标记已知类别的数据，利用标签的可聚类性来识别未标记池中的已知类别，并选择具有信息量的数据进行标注。",
