In this paper we study: 1) the performance of pre-computed features of neural networks based UWB (ultra wide band) localization classification forming the baseline of our experiments. 2) Investigate the inherent robustness of various neural networks; therefore, we include the study of robustness of the adversarial examples without any adversarial training in this work. 3) Propose a multi-head self-supervised neural network architecture which outperforms the baseline neural networks without any adversarial training. The model's performance improved by 67% at certain ranges of adversarial magnitude for fast gradient sign method and 37% each for basic iterative method and projected gradient descent method.",
