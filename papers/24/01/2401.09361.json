    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的标记霍克斯核推断方法，称之为基于矩的神经霍克斯估计方法。霍克斯过程可以通过它们的一阶和二阶统计特性完全描述，通过第二类Fredholm积分方程。利用最新的物理信息神经网络求解偏微分方程的进展，我们提出了一种在高维度下求解这个积分方程的数值过程。结合适应性训练流程，我们给出了一组通用的超参数，能够在各种核形状范围内产生稳健的结果。我们在模拟数据上进行了大量的数值验证。最后，我们提出了两个应用该方法于加密货币市场微观结构分析。在第一个应用中，我们提取了BTC-USD交易到达率对成交量的影响，第二个应用中，我们分析了15种加密货币之间的因果关系及其方向。",
