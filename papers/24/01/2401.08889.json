    "translated_abstract": "音频嵌入是理解大量音乐目录的重要工具。通常，嵌入是根据它们在各种下游任务中的表现来评估的，然而少有研究调查嵌入空间本身的局部特性，而这些局部特性对于最近邻算法在音乐搜索和推荐中的应用至关重要。在这项工作中，我们展示了在通过对比学习学习音乐数据集上的音频表示时，通常在一首曲目中是均匀的音乐特性（如音调和速度）在所得到的嵌入空间的邻域的局部性中得到了体现。通过应用适当的数据增强策略，这些特性的本地化不仅可以减少，而且其他属性的本地化也会增加。例如，与非专业听众关系较小的音高和速度等特征的局部性可能会得到缓解，同时改善更显著特征的局部性。",
