    "translated_abstract": "商业和技术通过逻辑和设计密切联系在一起。它们同样对社会变革敏感，可能因丑闻带来灾难。合作式多机器人系统(MRS)正在兴起，允许不同类型和品牌的机器人在各种环境中共同工作。生成式人工智能近年来一直是人工智能讨论的主要话题，因为它能够通过使用自然语言和生成媒体（包括深度伪造）来模仿人类。本文主要关注生成式AI的对话方面，因此使用了“对话生成式人工智能”（CGI）一词。像MRS一样，CGI在革新各个领域的流程并改变人类经营方式方面具有巨大潜力。从商业角度来看，仅就具有潜在利益冲突、隐私实践和安全问题的合作式MRS本身，就需要进行伦理考察。MRSs e",
