    "translated_abstract": "在无标签时间序列中，提出了用于医学信号处理的表示学习框架。尽管在之前的工作中取得了许多卓越进展，但我们观察到提取的时间序列表示仍然不能很好地泛化。在本文中，我们提出了一种通过声谱图进行时间序列（医学信号）表示学习的框架（TRLS），以获得更多信息的表示。我们将输入的时域医学信号转化为声谱图，并设计了一个称为时间频率RNN（TFRNN）的时频编码器，从增强的声谱图中捕捉更稳健的多尺度表示。我们的TRLS以声谱图作为输入，具有两种不同的数据增强方式，并最大化正样本之间的相似度，从而有效地规避了设计负样本的问题。我们对四个真实医学信号数据集进行的医学信号分类评估表明，TRLS优于现有的方法。",
