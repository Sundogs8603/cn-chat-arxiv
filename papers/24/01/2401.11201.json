To this end, we present a preregistered user study (n = 257) investigating whether different levels (low and high) of bias metrics and search results presentation (with or without AI-predicted stances labels) can affect the stance diversity consumption and search behavior of opinionated users on three debated topics (i.e., atheism, intellectual property rights, and school uniforms). Our results show that exposing participants to (counter-attitudinally) biased search results increases their consumption of attitude-opposing content, but we also found that bias was associated with a trend towar",

    "translated_abstract": "带有偏见的用户经常寻求与其先前信念一致的信息，同时忽视相矛盾的证据，这是由于确认偏见所致。这种行为阻碍了他们在搜索网络时考虑替代立场的能力。尽管如此，很少有研究分析争议话题的搜索结果多样化如何影响高度有意见的用户的搜索行为。为此，我们进行了一项预注册的用户研究(n = 257)，调查了不同水平(低和高)的偏见指标和搜索结果展示(带或不带基于人工智能预测的立场标签)是否会影响有意见的用户在三个有争议的话题上(即无神论、知识产权和校服)的立场多样性消费和搜索行为。我们的结果表明，将参与者暴露于(反态度)偏见的搜索结果会增加他们消费反对态度内容的数量，但我们也发现偏见与趋向。",
