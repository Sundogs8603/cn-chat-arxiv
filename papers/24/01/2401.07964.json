    "translated_abstract": "人工智能是一个拥有许多生命的领域，这个术语已经包含了一系列科学和商业努力。在这篇论文中，我阐述了人工智能具有一个被忽视但十分重要的科学角色，即“AI作为探索”。AI作为探索的基本思想是创建和研究能够揭示智能候选构建模块的系统，这些模块可能不同于我们熟悉的人类和动物智能形式。换句话说，我认为人工智能是探索智能空间，即可能的智能系统空间，的最佳工具之一。我通过关注一个具体的案例研究，即人类和大型语言模型在组合新颖和创造性概念方面的能力，来说明AI作为探索的价值。我展示了尽管后者在这样的任务中表现出人类水平的准确性，但很可能以根本不同的方式解决这个问题。",
