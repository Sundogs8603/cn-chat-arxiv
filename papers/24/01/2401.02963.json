We consider operative art as a new point of view generating a particular thought and solutions based on agile systems, but which may have reached their limits. We will limit ourselves here to the question of the potential contributions of the operatic perspective to understand or implement a set of actions related to competitive or economic warfare. To do this, we will begin by providing some answers to the question of what operatic",
