    "translated_abstract": "在许多最近的研究中，探索性景观分析（ELA）特征的潜力已经被证明可以对特定的单目标连续优化问题进行数值表征。这些数值特征为连续优化问题的各种机器学习任务提供输入，包括高级属性预测、自动算法选择和自动算法配置等。没有ELA特征，分析和理解单目标连续优化问题的特性将是不可能的。然而，尽管它们的实用性无可争议，ELA特征仍然存在一些缺点。其中包括（1.）多个特征之间的强相关性，以及（2.）其在多目标连续优化问题中的适用性非常有限。为解决这个问题，最近的研究提出了以深度学习为基础的方法作为ELA的替代方案。在这些研究中，例如，点云变换器被提出作为改进方法。",
