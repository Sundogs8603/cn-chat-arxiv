    "translated_abstract": "处理缺失数据是统计分析中一个重要问题，通常通过插补程序来解决。这些方法的性能和有效性对它们在实证研究中的应用非常重要。尽管多重链式方程插补（MICE）与预测均值匹配（PMM）被认为是社会科学文献中的标准方法，但复杂数据集的增加可能需要基于机器学习的更先进方法。特别是，基于树的插补方法已经成为竞争激烈的方法。然而，性能和有效性并不完全了解，尤其是与标准的MICE PMM相比。这在线性模型中的推理尤为明显。在本研究中，我们调查了各种插补方法对系数估计、类型I误差和功效的影响，以获得可以帮助实证研究人员更有效地处理缺失数据的见解。我们探索了MI方法的影响，并对多重插补的性能进行了评估。",
