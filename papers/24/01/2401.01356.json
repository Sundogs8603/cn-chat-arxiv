    "translated_abstract": "随着在线教育教室教学的普及，视频讲座越来越受欢迎和需求增加。如NPTEL等大规模在线开放课程（MOOCs）已经创建了高质量的教育内容，学生可以免费在线访问。全国许多大学现在都在课堂上使用NPTEL视频。因此，越来越多的视频讲座正在被记录、维护和上传。这些视频通常在讲座开始前包含有关该视频的信息。我们通常观察到，这些教育视频具有包含五到六个属性的元数据：学院名称、出版商名称、系别名称、教授名称、学科名称和主题名称。如果我们能按照它们的类别组织这些视频，将更容易维护这些视频。根据这些信息对这些视频进行索引对世界各地的学生高效利用这些视频非常有益。在这个项目中，我们尝试获取元数据信息来构建一个高效的视频索引。",
