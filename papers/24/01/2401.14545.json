    "translated_abstract": "在使用结构变量自回归（SVAR）处理经过季节调整的宏观经济数据之前，通常需要通过季节调整技术去除原始数据中的季节性。然而，这种方法可能会扭曲数据中所包含的有价值信息。作为一种替代方法，本文提出了一种直接建模非季节性调整的原始数据周期性特征的方法，即结构性周期性向量自回归（SPVAR），其基于周期性向量自回归（PVAR）作为约化形式模型。与VAR相比，PVAR不仅可以允许周期性变化的截距，还可以允许周期性自回归参数和创新方差。由于这种更大的灵活性也导致参数数量增加，因此我们提出了线性约束估计技术。总体而言，SPVAR可以捕捉季节效应，并实现直接和更精细的结构推断。",
