    "abstract": "Automatic detection and tracking of emotional states has the potential for helping individuals with various mental health conditions. While previous studies have captured physiological signals using wearable devices in laboratory settings, providing valuable insights into the relationship between physiological responses and mental states, the transfer of these findings to real-life scenarios is still in its nascent stages. Our research aims to bridge the gap between laboratory-based studies and real-life settings by leveraging consumer-grade wearables and self-report measures. We conducted a preliminary study involving 15 healthy participants to assess the efficacy of wearables in capturing user valence in real-world settings. In this paper, we present the initial analysis of the collected data, focusing primarily on the results of valence classification. Our findings demonstrate promising results in distinguishing between high and low positive valence, achieving an F1 score of 0.65. T",

    "translated_abstract": "自动检测和跟踪情感状态有助于帮助各种心理健康状况的个体。尽管先前的研究已经在实验室环境中利用可穿戴设备捕捉了生理信号，为了解生理反应和心理状态的关系提供了有价值的见解，但是将这些发现转化到现实生活场景仍处于初级阶段。我们的研究旨在通过利用消费级可穿戴设备和自我报告措施来弥合实验室研究和现实场景之间的差距。我们进行了一项初步研究，涉及15名健康参与者，以评估在现实场景中捕捉用户情感价值的可穿戴设备的功效。在本文中，我们首先对收集到的数据进行了初步分析，重点关注情感价值分类的结果。我们的研究结果显示，在高和低正面情感之间具有很好的区分能力，F1分数达到0.65。",
