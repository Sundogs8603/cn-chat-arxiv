    "translated_abstract": "机械超材料是一种通过精心设计其内部结构，可以具有异常弹性、刚度和稳定性等非凡物理特性的合成材料。为了使超材料包含具有独特机械性能的精细局部结构，使用高分辨率体素来表示它们是一种潜在方法。然而，这会带来巨大的计算负担。为此，本论文提出了一种快速的反向设计方法，其核心是先进的深度生成人工智能算法，用于生成基于体素的机械超材料。具体而言，我们使用自条件扩散模型，在仅需3秒的时间内生成分辨率为 $128^3$ 的微结构，以逼近指定的均质化张量矩阵。因此，这种快速的反向设计工具有助于探索极端超材料、超材料中的序列插值以及生成多尺度的多样微结构。",
