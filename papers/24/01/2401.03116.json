    "translated_abstract": "分布式拒绝服务（DDoS）攻击对在线系统的稳定性和可靠性构成重大威胁。有效和早期检测此类攻击对于保护网络的完整性至关重要。在这项工作中，我们通过利用深度残差神经网络（ResNets）和合成过采样技术的能力，引入了一种增强的DDoS攻击检测方法。由于许多网络安全数据集中存在固有的类别不平衡，传统方法常常在将细微的DDoS模式误判为良性时困难重重。通过将合成少数类过采样技术（SMOTE）应用于CICIDS数据集，我们平衡了良性和恶意数据点的表示，使模型能够更好地辨别攻击的复杂模式。我们针对这一特定任务定制的深度残差网络进一步完善了检测过程。对一个现实世界数据集的实验结果表明，我们的方法在DDoS攻击检测方面取得了良好的效果。",
