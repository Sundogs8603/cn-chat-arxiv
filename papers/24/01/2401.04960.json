    "translated_abstract": "受到四旋翼器在载荷传递中的越来越广泛应用的启发，我们考虑了一个四旋翼器的联合轨迹生成和反馈控制设计问题，考虑了四旋翼器在空气动力学力的作用下的运动。携带的载荷产生的未建模空气动力学阻力力可能导致灾难性的后果。之前的工作将空气动力学效应建模为控制问题中的剩余动力学或外部干扰，引导出一种可能造成灾难的反应性政策。此外，在硬件平台上重新设计控制器和调整控制增益是一项费时的工作。在本文中，我们认为保持控制器固定，只改变轨迹生成部分能够提高在受到阻力力影响下的四旋翼器系统的轨迹跟踪能力。为了实现这一点，我们通过对最优四旋翼器控制问题应用适当的松弛，引入了一个衡量控制器跟踪参考轨迹能力的跟踪成本函数，从而形成一个考虑风阻的规划问题。",
