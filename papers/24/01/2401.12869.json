    "translated_abstract": "语言模型（LMs）可以通过编写程序来解决诸如回答表格或图像相关问题的任务。然而，使用基本函数通常会导致冗长且容易出错的程序，而高级函数需要专家设计。为了实现无需人力的更好解决方案，我们要求代码LMs策划可重用的高级函数，并使用它们编写解决方案。我们提出了TROVE，一种无需训练的方法，通过生成、使用、扩展和定期修剪工具箱，引导生成可验证和高效的函数工具箱。在从数学、表格问答和图像推理任务中得到的11个数据集上，TROVE始终比使用CODELLAMA和先前使用GPT的基准方法产生更简单且更准确的解决方案，同时使用79-98%更小的工具箱。TROVE还使得人工验证比基准方法快31％且准确性更高13％。在相同的流程下，它为不同的任务和数据集创建了多样化的函数，为我们提供了洞见。",
