    "translated_abstract": "基于多模式大型语言模型（LLMs）的AI agent被期望着革新人机交互，并在诸如医疗保健、教育、制造业和娱乐等各个领域提供更个性化的助理服务。在6G网络中部署LLM agents使用户能够通过移动设备民主地访问此前昂贵的AI助理服务，从而减少交互延迟，并更好地保护用户隐私。然而，移动设备的有限容量限制了部署和执行本地LLMs的有效性，这就需要在长期交互过程中将复杂任务卸载到运行在边缘服务器上的全局LLMs。在本文中，我们提出了一种在6G网络中为LLM agents设计的分布式学习系统，利用移动设备和边缘服务器之间的协作，多个具有不同角色的LLMs分布在移动设备和边缘服务器之间实现。",
