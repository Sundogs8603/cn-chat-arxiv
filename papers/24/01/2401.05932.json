    "translated_abstract": "通过准确的数据同化生成初始条件对于可靠的天气预报和气候模拟至关重要。我们提出了DiffDA作为一种基于机器学习的数据同化方法，能够使用预测状态和稀疏观测来同化大气变量。我们将预训练的GraphCast天气预报模型作为去噪扩散模型。我们的方法应用了两阶段条件：在训练和推理过程中对预测状态进行条件化，在推理过程中只对稀疏观测进行条件化。作为副产品，这种策略还能将预测后处理到未来，在这种情况下没有可用的观测数据。通过基于再分析数据集的实验证明，我们的方法可以以0.25度分辨率生成与观测一致的同化全球大气数据。实验证明，通过我们的方法生成的初始条件可以用于具有较小损失的预报模型。",
