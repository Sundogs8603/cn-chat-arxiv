    "abstract": "Purpose: Ultrasound is the most commonly used medical imaging modality for diagnosis and screening in clinical practice. Due to its safety profile, noninvasive nature and portability, ultrasound is the primary imaging modality for fetal assessment in pregnancy. Current ultrasound processing methods are either manual or semi-automatic and are therefore laborious, time-consuming and prone to errors, and automation would go a long way in addressing these challenges. Automated identification of placental changes at earlier gestation could facilitate potential therapies for conditions such as fetal growth restriction and pre-eclampsia that are currently detected only at late gestational age, potentially preventing perinatal morbidity and mortality.  Methods: We propose an automatic three-dimensional multi-modal (B-mode and power Doppler) ultrasound segmentation of the human placenta using deep learning combined with different fusion strategies.We collected data containing Bmode and power Do",

    "translated_abstract": "目的：超声是临床实践中常用的医学成像模态，因其安全性、无创性和便携性，成为孕期胎儿评估的主要成像模态。当前超声处理方法要么是手动的，要么是半自动的，因此工作量大、耗时长且容易出错，自动化将在解决这些挑战方面大有帮助。在较早的孕期自动识别胎盘变化可能有助于治疗胎儿生长受限和子痫前期等疾病，这些疾病目前仅能在晚期孕龄检测到，潜在地可以预防周围婴儿的发病率和死亡率。方法：我们提出了一种使用深度学习结合不同融合策略的自动化三维多模式（B模式和功率多普勒）超声胎盘分割方法。",
