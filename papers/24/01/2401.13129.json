    "translated_abstract": "准确地对文本片段中的实体提供类型划分是各种自然语言处理应用的基本任务。许多先前的方法依赖于大量的人工注释数据来执行实体类型划分。然而，在高度专业化的科学和工程领域（例如软件工程和安全领域）中收集此类数据可能耗时且昂贵，更不用提这些模型如果需要应用于保密数据集时，训练和推断数据之间的领域差异。在本文中，我们研究了在科学和工程领域中的种子引导下对细粒度实体类型进行划分的任务，该任务以实体的名称和一些种子实体作为唯一的监督，并旨在将新的实体提及分类为已知和未知类型（即没有种子实体的类型）。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了SEType，首先利用上下文化的无标注语料库找到每个已知类型的更多实体来丰富弱监督信息，然后使用一种带有两层多头注意力的条件随机场模型对实体进行划分。",
