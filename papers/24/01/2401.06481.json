    "abstract": "Fixed point lattice actions are designed to have continuum classical properties unaffected by discretization effects and reduced lattice artifacts at the quantum level. They provide a possible way to extract continuum physics with coarser lattices, thereby allowing to circumvent problems with critical slowing down and topological freezing toward the continuum limit. A crucial ingredient for practical applications is to find an accurate and compact parametrization of a fixed point action, since many of its properties are only implicitly defined. Here we use machine learning methods to revisit the question of how to parametrize fixed point actions. In particular, we obtain a fixed point action for four-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory using convolutional neural networks with exact gauge invariance. The large operator space allows us to find superior parametrizations compared to previous studies, a necessary first step for future Monte Carlo simulations.",

    "translated_abstract": "固定点的格子作用被设计成具有不受离散化效应影响的连续经典性质，并在量子层面上减少格子效应。它们提供了一种用较粗的格子来提取连续物理的可能方法，从而绕过与连续极限相关的临界减慢和拓扑冻结问题。实际应用的关键是找到一个精确且紧凑的固定点作用参数化方法，因为其许多性质只是隐含定义的。在这里，我们使用机器学习方法重新思考了如何参数化固定点作用的问题。特别地，我们使用具有精确规范不变性的卷积神经网络获得四维SU（3）规范理论的固定点作用。大的算子空间使我们能够找到比之前研究更好的参数化方法，这是未来蒙特卡洛模拟的必要第一步。",
