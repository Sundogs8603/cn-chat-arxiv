    "translated_abstract": "对抗性样本是各种视觉应用中一个关键的安全威胁，注入人眼无法察觉的扰动可以混淆输出。在黑盒环境下生成可迁移的对抗性样本在实践中至关重要但具有挑战性。现有的基于输入多样性的方法采用不同的图像变换，但由于输入多样性不足和相同的扰动步长可能效率低下。受到不同图像区域在分类中具有不同权重的启发，本文通过同时设计增强的输入多样性和自适应的步长，提出了一个黑盒对抗生成框架。我们设计了本地混合来随机混合一组变换后的对抗性图像，增强了输入多样性。为了精确生成对抗性样本，我们将扰动投影到$tanh$空间以放松边界约束。此外，不同区域的步长可以通过整合适应性调整。",
