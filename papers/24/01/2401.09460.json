    "abstract": "Acquired images for medical and other purposes can be affected by noise from both the equipment used in the capturing or the environment. This can have adverse effect on the information therein. Thus, the need to restore the image to its original state by removing the noise. To effectively remove such noise, pre knowledge of the type of noise model present is necessary. This work explores different noise removal filters by first introducing noise to an image and then applying different spatial domain filtering techniques to the image to get rid of the noise. Different evaluation techniques such as Peak to Signal Noise Ratio(PSNR) and Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) were adopted to determine how effective each filter is on a given image noise. Result showed that some filters are more effective on some noise models than others.",
