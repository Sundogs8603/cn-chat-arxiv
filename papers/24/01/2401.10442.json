    "translated_abstract": "严谨性和清晰性对于解释深度神经网络（DNNs）以产生人类信任都是至关重要的。路径方法常用于生成满足三个公理的严谨归因。然而，由于路径选择的不同，归因的含义仍然模糊不清。为了解决这种模糊性，我们引入了“集中原则”，将高度重要的特征集中分配给高度归因，从而赋予美感和稀疏性。然后，我们提出了一种模型无关的解释器“SAMP”，它可以从预定义的一组操纵路径中高效地搜索近乎最优的路径。此外，我们提出了无穷小约束（IC）和动量策略（MS）来改善严谨性和优化性。可视化结果显示，SAMP可以通过准确定位显著的图像像素来精确揭示DNNs。我们还进行了定量实验，观察到我们的方法显著优于对应方法。代码：https://github.com/zbr17/SAMP。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper explores the significance of path choice in clear attribution in path methods. By introducing the \"Concentration Principle,\" the authors propose a model-agnostic interpreter called SAMP, which uses infinitesimal constraints and momentum strategy to improve rigor and optimality. Experimental results show that their method can accurately reveal DNNs and outperforms other approaches."
