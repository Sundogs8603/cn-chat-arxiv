    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度学习在表格数据上的应用引起了越来越多的关注，但是在处理结构化数据时，使用深度模型仍然具有挑战性。虽然这些模型在处理非结构化数据时表现出色，但在处理结构化数据时效果有限。最近的研究引入了检索增强模型来填补这一差距，在监督任务（如分类和回归）中展示了有希望的结果。在这项工作中，我们研究了在表格数据上使用检索增强模型进行异常检测。我们提出了一种基于重建的方法，其中一个Transformer模型学习重建“正常”样本的被屏蔽特征。我们测试了基于KNN和注意力机制的模块的有效性，以选择相关样本来帮助目标样本的重建过程。我们在一个包含31个表格数据集的基准测试上进行了实验，结果显示通过使用非参数化关系进行检索增强的异常检测（AD）方法能取得良好的效果。",
