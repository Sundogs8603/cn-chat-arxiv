    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种新型的两阶段基于机器学习的代理建模框架，用于解决科学和工程领域中的反问题。在提出的框架的第一阶段，一种称为“学习者”的机器学习模型识别出一组在输入设计空间中，其预测输出与期望结果密切一致的候选项。随后，在第二阶段中，采用一个独立的代理模型作为“评估者”，来评估在第一阶段生成的缩减候选空间。这个评估过程通过用户定义的覆盖水平来消除不准确和不确定的解决方案。该框架的独特贡献在于集成了符合推理，提供了一种多功能和高效的方法，可以广泛应用。为了证明所提出的框架相对于传统的单阶段反问题的有效性，我们进行了几个基准测试，并研究了一个工程应用。",
