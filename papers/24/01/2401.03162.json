    "translated_abstract": "随着网络服务技术的进步，云服务的快速增长使得从众多选项中选择高质量的服务变得复杂。本研究旨在通过质量服务（QoS）解决网络服务推荐中的数据稀疏性和冷启动问题。我们提出了一种名为QoS感知的图对比学习（QAGCL）的新方法来进行网络服务推荐。我们的模型利用图对比学习的能力来处理冷启动问题并有效提高推荐准确性。通过构建具有地理位置信息和随机性的上下文增强图，我们的模型提供多样化的视角。通过使用图卷积网络和图对比学习技术，我们从这些增强图中学习用户和服务的嵌入。然后利用学到的嵌入将QoS考虑无缝集成到推荐过程中。实验结果表明，我们的方法在解决数据稀疏性和冷启动问题的同时显著提高了推荐质量。",
