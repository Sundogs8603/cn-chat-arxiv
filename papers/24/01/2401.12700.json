    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统往往容易受到精心制作的虚假个人资料的影响，导致推荐结果存在偏见。在现有的防御方法中，基于数据处理的方法不可避免地会排除正常样本，而基于模型的方法则无法同时实现泛化性和鲁棒性。为此，我们提出了一个综合数据处理和鲁棒模型的通用框架，Triple Cooperative Defense（TCD），它采用三个协同模型相互增强数据，从而提高推荐的鲁棒性。此外，考虑到现有攻击方法在平衡双层优化和效率方面存在困难，我们重新审视了推荐系统中的攻击问题，并引入了一种高效的攻击策略，Co-training Attack（Co-Attack），该策略在考虑双层设置的同时，协同优化攻击优化和模型训练，保持攻击的效率。此外，我们揭示了现有攻击威胁不足的一个潜在原因。",
