    "translated_abstract": "在顺序决策中，处理非稳态环境是一个基本（且在很大程度上是未解决的）挑战，其中外部环境条件随时间变化。这类问题通常被建模为非稳态马尔可夫决策过程（NSMDP）。然而，现有的NSMDP决策方法存在两个主要缺点：首先，它们假设当前时刻更新的环境动态是已知的（尽管未来动态可能会改变）；其次，规划过程主要是悲观的，即代理人会“安全行动”以考虑环境的非稳态演变。我们认为这两个假设在实践中是无效的-更新的环境条件很少是已知的，并且当代理人与环境交互时，它可以学习更新的动态并避免悲观，至少在其对动态有信心的状态下。我们提出了一种启发式搜索算法，称为自适应蒙特卡洛树搜索。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种自适应蒙特卡洛树搜索算法来应对非稳态环境下的决策问题，解决了传统方法中对环境动态假设的限制和规划过程的悲观性问题。",
