    "translated_abstract": "使用深度神经网络实现的模式识别系统比线性模型获得更好的结果。然而，它们的缺点是黑盒属性。这意味着没有经验使用非线性系统的人可能需要帮助理解决策结果。这种解决方案对于负责最终决策的用户来说是不可接受的。他不仅必须相信决策，还必须理解决策。因此，识别器必须具有允许解释者解释结果的架构。事后可解释的分类器的想法是设计一个可解释的分类器，与黑盒分类器并行，给出与黑盒分类器相同的决策。本文表明，如果Zadeh的模糊逻辑函数形成分类器，DeconvNet的重要性给出了真值，可解释的分类器在MNIST和FashionMNIST数据库上与黑盒分类器产生相同的分类决策。",
