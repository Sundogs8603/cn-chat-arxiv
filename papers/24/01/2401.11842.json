Identifying such heterogeneous treatment effects is key for precision medicine and many post-hoc analysis methods have been developed for that purpose. While several benchmarks have been carried out to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these methods, notably for binary and continuous endpoints, similar systematic empirical evaluation of subgroup analysis for time-to-event endpoints are lacking. This work aims to fill this gap by evaluating several subgroup analysis algorithms in the context of time-to-event outcomes, by means of three different research questions: Is there heterogeneity? What are the biomarkers responsible for such heterogeneity? Who are the good responders to treatment? In this context, we propose a new synthetic and semi-synthetic data generation process that allows one to explore a wide range of heterogeneity scenarios ",

    "translated_abstract": "非显著的随机对照试验可能隐藏了对实验性药物有良好反应的亚组，从而阻碍了后续的发展。鉴定这种异质性治疗效应对于精准医学至关重要，为此已经开发出许多事后分析方法。虽然已经进行了几个基准测试来鉴定这些方法的优点和缺点，尤其是对于二进制和连续终点，但是对于时间到事件终点的亚组分析缺乏类似的系统实证评估。本工作旨在通过评估几种时间到事件结果的亚组分析算法来填补这个空白，通过三个不同的研究问题：是否存在异质性？什么生物标志物是导致这种异质性的原因？谁是对治疗有良好反应的人？在这种情况下，我们提出了一种新的合成和半合成数据生成过程，使人们能够探索广泛的异质性情景。",
