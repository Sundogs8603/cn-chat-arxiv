    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型的出现彻底改变了信息检索，带来了广泛的知识获取能力的新时代。虽然这些模型在提供开放世界知识方面表现出色，但在具有不同读写能力的多语言环境中有效提取答案仍然是一个严峻的挑战。检索增强生成（RAG）成为一种有希望的解决方案，弥合了信息可获取性和多语言理解之间的差距。然而，将RAG模型部署到现实世界的情景中需要仔细考虑各种因素。本文解决了在多元文化环境中实施RAG模型所面临的关键挑战。我们深入探讨了包括数据供给策略、及时更新、幻觉缓解、错误响应预防和交付速度优化在内的关键考虑因素。我们的工作涉及将各种工具整合在一起，细致地组合以便促进无缝运作。",
