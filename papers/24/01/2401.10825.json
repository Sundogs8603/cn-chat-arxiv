    "abstract": "Named Entity Recognition seeks to extract substrings within a text that name real-world objects and to determine their type (for example, whether they refer to persons or organizations). In this survey, we first present an overview of recent popular approaches, but we also look at graph- and transformer- based methods including Large Language Models (LLMs) that have not had much coverage in other surveys. Second, we focus on methods designed for datasets with scarce annotations. Third, we evaluate the performance of the main NER implementations on a variety of datasets with differing characteristics (as regards their domain, their size, and their number of classes). We thus provide a deep comparison of algorithms that are never considered together. Our experiments shed some light on how the characteristics of datasets affect the behavior of the methods that we compare.",

    "translated_abstract": "命名实体识别旨在从文本中提取出命名真实世界对象的子字符串，并确定其类型（例如，是否指人物或组织）。在本综述中，我们首先概述了最近流行的方法，同时还关注了基于图和变换器的方法，包括很少在其他综述中涉及的大型语言模型（LLMs）。其次，我们重点介绍了针对稀缺注释数据集设计的方法。第三，我们评估了主要命名实体识别实现在各种具有不同特征（领域、规模和类别数）的数据集上的性能。因此，我们提供了一种从未同时考虑的算法的深度比较。我们的实验揭示了数据集特征如何影响我们比较的方法的行为。",
