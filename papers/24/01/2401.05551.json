    "translated_abstract": "目标：我们旨在研究自动语音识别（ASR）系统的错误如何影响痴呆症分类准确性，特别是在“饼干偷窃”图片描述任务中。我们旨在评估不完美的ASR生成的转录是否可以为区分认知健康个体和患有阿尔茨海默病（AD）的语言样本提供有价值的信息。方法：我们使用不同的ASR模型进行实验，并使用后期编辑技术改进它们的转录。这些不完美的ASR转录和手动转录作为下游痴呆症分类的输入。我们进行了全面的错误分析，比较模型性能并评估ASR生成的转录在痴呆症分类中的有效性。结果：令人惊讶的是，不完美的ASR生成的转录在区分患有AD的个体和健康个体之间的表现优于手动转录。",
