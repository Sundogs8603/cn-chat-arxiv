    "translated_abstract": "修辞结构理论暗示了文本的单一话语解释不存在，并且RST解析器的局限性进一步加剧了类似结构的不一致解析。因此，重要的是要考虑到在语义上相似的文本中可以找到相同的论证结构但修辞结构各异。本研究从修辞角度评估了同一论证方案中的释义差异。研究提出了一种深层依存解析模型来评估修辞和论证结构之间的联系。该模型利用修辞关系，修辞结构的释义作为训练数据增强。该方法允许使用修辞树而不是词序列进行端到端的论证分析。它在双语微文语料库上进行了评估，并报告了该语料库俄文版本的完整论证解析的初步结果。结果表明，论证结构和修辞结构之间的连接可以有效地在不同修辞结构下进行分析。",
