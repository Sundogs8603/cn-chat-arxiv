    "translated_abstract": "近年来，出现了许多新颖的应用程序，以协作的方式促进服务和活动的提供。这种系统的关键思想是利用现有资源的闲置或低使用率，以提供改进的服务，帮助人们完成日常任务，并提供额外功能、增加效率和/或降低成本。尤其在城市交通领域，许多研究人员提出了新颖的想法，然后通过常常利用人工智能方法和工具进行原型的实现和评估。然而，这些提议也引发了多个非技术问题，如果想将这些系统应用于实际世界，就需要对其进行充分的识别和解决。尽管在实践中，与基于人工智能的系统相关的法律和伦理问题很少在研究和开发过程初期考虑，但我们认为这些问题不仅限制了设计决策，同时也制约了系统范围的扩展和实施。",
