    "translated_abstract": "我们调查了Richard和Montanari（2014）引入的Tensor PCA模型的功率迭代算法。之前研究Tensor功率迭代算法的工作要么仅限于固定次数的迭代，要么需要一个非平凡的与数据无关的初始化。在本文中，我们超越了这些限制，并对随机初始化的Tensor功率迭代的动态进行了多项式数量级的分析。我们的贡献有三个方面：首先，我们建立了对于广泛的信噪比范围下，功率迭代收敛到种植信号所需迭代次数的尖锐界限。其次，我们的分析揭示了实际的算法阈值比文献中猜测的要小一个polylog(n)的因子，其中n是环境维度。最后，我们提出了一种简单而有效的功率迭代停止准则，可以保证输出与真实信号高度相关的解决方案。",
