    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了RAISE（Scratchpad和Examples辅助推理和行为）,一种先进的架构，增强了将GPT-4等大型语言模型（LLMs）整合到对话代理中的能力。RAISE是ReAct框架的改进版本，包括一个双组件记忆系统，模仿人类的短期记忆和长期记忆，以保持对话的上下文和连续性。它包括了一个全面的代理构建情景，包括对话选择，场景提取，CoT完成和场景增强等阶段，最终导致LLMs的训练阶段。这种方法似乎提高了代理在复杂的多轮对话中的可控性和适应性。我们在房地产销售环境中的初步评估表明，RAISE相对于传统代理有一些优势，表明它在更广泛的应用中具有潜力。通过提供一个强大的框架来开发更具上下文感知和多功能的对话代理，这项工作为AI领域做出了贡献。",
