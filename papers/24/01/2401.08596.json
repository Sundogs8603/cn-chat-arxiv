    "abstract": "This paper uses nighttime light(NTL) data to measure the nexus of the non-banking sector, particularly insurance, and economic growth in South Africa. We hypothesize that insurance sector growth positively propels economic growth due to its economic growth-supportive traits like investment protection and optimal risk mitigation. We also claim that Nighttime light data is a good economic measure than Gross domestic product (GDP). We used weighted regressions to measure the relationships between nighttime light data, GDP, and insurance sector development. We used time series South African GDP data collected from the World Bank for the period running from 2000 to 2018, and the nighttime lights data from the National Geophysical Data Centre (NGDC) in partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). From the models fitted and the reported BIC, AIC, and likelihood ratios, the insurance sector proved to have more predictive power on economic development in South Af",

    "translated_abstract": "本文利用夜间灯光数据来衡量南非非银行业（特别是保险业）与经济增长之间的关系。我们假设保险业的增长对经济增长起到积极推动作用，原因是它具有投资保护和风险优化的特点。我们还声称夜间灯光数据是比国内生产总值更好的经济指标。我们使用加权回归来衡量夜间灯光数据、国内生产总值和保险业发展之间的关系。我们使用来自世界银行的南非国内生产总值的时间序列数据（2000-2018年），以及与美国国家海洋和大气管理局合作的国家地球物理数据中心（NGDC）的夜间灯光数据。从拟合的模型和报告的BIC，AIC和似然比中可以看出，保险业在南非经济发展方面具有更强的预测能力。",
