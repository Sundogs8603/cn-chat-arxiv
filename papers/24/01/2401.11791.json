    "translated_abstract": "弱监督语义分割（WSSS）旨在利用仅具有图像级监督的图像数据来训练分割模型。由于无法获得精确的像素级标注，现有方法通常侧重于通过优化CAM样式的热图来生成用于训练分割模型的伪标记。然而，生成的热图可能仅捕获对象类别的具有区分性的图像区域或相关的共同出现的背景。为解决这些问题，我们提出了一种用于WSSS的语义提示学习（SemPLeS）框架，该框架学习有效地提示CLIP潜空间以增强分割区域与目标对象类别之间的语义对准。具体而言，我们提出了对比提示学习和提示引导的语义细化，以学习适当描述和抑制与每个目标对象类别相关的共同出现的背景的提示。",
