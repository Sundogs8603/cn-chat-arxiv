    "translated_abstract": "宗教是否规定了生态学原则？本文在理论和实证方面研究了宗教信仰在塑造环境互动中的作用。我们研究了将森林置于神圣领域的非洲传统宗教（ATR）。我们建立了一个非市场交互的平均场类型模型，其中具有不同宗教信仰的个体的行为不断影响森林覆盖的空间密度。平衡的开采策略显示了个体信仰及其在人口中的分布如何成为森林保护的关键驱动因素。该模型还描述了资源稀缺在个体和人口开采决策中的作用。我们依靠贝宁这一独特情况进行实证测试，贝宁自由报告非洲传统宗教的依从度。利用工具变量策略，利用与贝宁-尼日利亚边境临近程度的变化，我们发现，ATR依从度的标准差增加1会导致森林覆盖减少。",
