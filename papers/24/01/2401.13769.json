    "translated_abstract": "图拓扑推断，即从给定的节点观察数据中学习图，是许多应用领域中的重要任务。现有的方法大多局限于学习单个图，假设观察数据是均匀的。这是有问题的，因为许多现代数据集是异质的或混合的，并涉及多个相关的图，即多视图图。最近的工作提出了学习多视图图，通过成对正则化保证了学习的视图图的相似性，即鼓励每对视图具有相似的结构。然而，这种方法无法推断出视图之间的共享结构。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于一致正则化的替代方法，通过学习表示视图的共同结构的一致图，确保视图之间的相似性。具体而言，我们提出了一个优化问题，假设图数据在多视图图上是平滑的，并且图的拓扑结构在视图之间是一致的。",
