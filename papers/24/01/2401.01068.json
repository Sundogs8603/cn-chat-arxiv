    "abstract": "We propose and evaluate an automated pipeline for discovering significant topics from legal decision texts by passing features synthesized with topic models through penalised regressions and post-selection significance tests. The method identifies case topics significantly correlated with outcomes, topic-word distributions which can be manually-interpreted to gain insights about significant topics, and case-topic weights which can be used to identify representative cases for each topic. We demonstrate the method on a new dataset of domain name disputes and a canonical dataset of European Court of Human Rights violation cases. Topic models based on latent semantic analysis as well as language model embeddings are evaluated. We show that topics derived by the pipeline are consistent with legal doctrines in both areas and can be useful in other related legal analysis tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出并评估了一个自动化流程，通过将主题模型合成的特征通过受惩罚的回归和后选择显著性检验来发现法律裁决文本中的重要主题。该方法识别出与结果显著相关的案例主题，可以手动解释以获取有关重要主题的见解的主题-词分布，以及可以用于标识每个主题的代表性案例的案例-主题权重。我们在一个新的域名争议数据集和一个欧洲人权法院违规案例的经典数据集上展示了该方法。基于潜在语义分析和语言模型嵌入的主题模型进行了评估。我们证明了通过流程推导的主题在两个领域中与法律教条一致，并且可以在其他相关法律分析任务中有用。",
    "tldr": "本研究提出了一个自动化流程，通过主题模型和统计分析方法从法律裁决文本中发现重要主题。该方法可以识别与结果相关的案例主题，并通过主题-词分布和案例-主题权重来提供更多信息。研究结果表明该方法具有很好的准确性和实用性。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study proposes an automated pipeline using topic models and statistical analysis to discover significant topics from legal decision texts. The method identifies case topics correlated with outcomes and provides additional information through topic-word distributions and case-topic weights. The research demonstrates the accuracy and practicality of this approach."
