    "translated_abstract": "近年来，图神经网络在各种图学习任务中表现出了相当的有效性，特别是基于消息传递方法。然而，它们的性能常常受到有限接收域的限制，在稀疏图存在的情况下，挑战变得更加严峻。鉴于具有无限扩展能力的幂级数，我们提出了一种新颖的图幂滤波器神经网络 (GPFN)，通过使用幂级数图滤波器来增强节点分类。具体而言，我们的GPFN设计了一种基于收敛幂级数的具有无限接收域的图滤波器构建方法，可以在频谱和空间域中进行分析。此外，我们还从理论上证明了我们的GPFN是一个通用框架，可以集成任何幂级数并捕捉长程依赖关系。最后，我们在三个数据集上进行了实验，并展示了GPFN在稀疏图上的优越性能。",
