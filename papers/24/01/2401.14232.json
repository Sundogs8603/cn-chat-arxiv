    "abstract": "This study developed a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based defense method for traffic sign classification in an autonomous vehicle (AV), referred to as the attack-resilient GAN (AR-GAN). The novelty of the AR-GAN lies in (i) assuming zero knowledge of adversarial attack models and samples and (ii) providing consistently high traffic sign classification performance under various adversarial attack types. The AR-GAN classification system consists of a generator that denoises an image by reconstruction, and a classifier that classifies the reconstructed image. The authors have tested the AR-GAN under no-attack and under various adversarial attacks, such as Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), DeepFool, Carlini and Wagner (C&W), and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). The authors considered two forms of these attacks, i.e., (i) black-box attacks (assuming the attackers possess no prior knowledge of the classifier), and (ii) white-box attacks (assuming the attackers possess full knowledge",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究开发了一种基于生成对抗网络（GAN）的防御方法，用于自动驾驶车辆中的交通标志分类，称为攻击鲁棒的GAN（AR-GAN）。AR-GAN的创新之处在于（i）假设对抗攻击模型和样本一无所知，（ii）在各种对抗攻击类型下始终提供高水平的交通标志分类性能。AR-GAN分类系统由一个通过重建去噪图像的生成器和一个对重建图像进行分类的分类器组成。作者在没有攻击和各种对抗攻击（如快速梯度符号法（FGSM），DeepFool，Carlini和Wagner（C&W），以及投影梯度下降（PGD））的情况下测试了AR-GAN。作者考虑了这些攻击的两种形式，即（i）黑盒攻击（假设攻击者对分类器没有任何先验知识），以及（ii）白盒攻击（假设攻击者拥有完全知识）。",
