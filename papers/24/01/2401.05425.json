    "translated_abstract": "癫痫是全球最常见的神经疾病之一，影响着全球约5000万人。幸运的是，如果能得到正确的诊断和治疗，高达70%的癫痫患者可以无癫痫发作地生活，而一种可靠的监测癫痫发作的技术可以提高那些不断面临随机发作恐惧的患者的生活质量。尽管基于头皮的脑电图（EEG）测试是诊断癫痫的黄金标准，但该方法成本高、需要住院治疗、需要熟练的操作人员，并且对用户来说不舒适。在本文中，我们提出了EarSD，一种新颖的轻量级、无干扰和社会接受度高的耳戴系统，通过测量用户耳后部位的生理信号来检测癫痫发作的开始。EarSD包括一个集成的自定义传感、计算和通信电路板，用于收集和放大感兴趣的信号，去除运动伪影和环境噪声。",
