    "translated_abstract": "基于WiFi信道状态信息（CSI）的人体活动识别能够在室内环境中实现无接触和视觉保护隐私的感知。然而，由于环境条件和感知硬件的差异，模型泛化能力差是这个领域中一个众所周知的问题。为了解决这个问题，本文将常用于基于图像学习的数据增强技术应用于WiFi CSI，并研究它们对模型泛化性能在跨场景和跨系统设置中的影响。特别是，我们专注于线性视线（LOS）和非线性视线（NLOS）穿墙场景之间的泛化，以及不同天线系统之间的泛化，这仍然是一个未经充分探索的领域。我们收集并公开了一个包含人体活动CSI幅度谱图的数据集。利用这个数据集，进行了一个消融研究，基于EfficientNetV2架构构建了活动识别模型，并评估了不同数据增强技术的效果。",
