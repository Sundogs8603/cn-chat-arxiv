    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络(GNNs)在建模不同领域的图数据中具有广泛的应用。虽然GNN在测试数据与训练数据符合同一分布(即分布内,ID)的场景中表现出色，但当面对来自不熟悉分布(即领域外,OOD)的样本时，它们通常会出现错误的预测。为了用GNNs识别和拒绝OOD样本，最近的研究探索了图OOD检测，通常集中在训练特定模型或在经过良好训练的GNN之上修改数据。尽管这些方法是有效的，但它们需要重型的训练资源和成本，因为它们需要在训练数据上优化基于GNN的模型。此外，它们对修改原始GNN和访问训练数据的依赖进一步限制了它们的普适性。为此，本文介绍了一种在测试时检测图形的方法(GOODAT)，这是一种面向数据、无监督和即插即用的解决方案。",
