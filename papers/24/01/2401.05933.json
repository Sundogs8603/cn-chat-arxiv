    "translated_abstract": "菲律宾的HIV/AIDS疫情在西太平洋地区传播速度最快，2010年至2021年间HIV发病率增长了676%。尽管COVID-19对HIV服务和发展的完全影响尚不明确，但预计这种干扰可能会导致HIV死亡人数显著增加。因此，该国需要一些建模和预测技术来预测传播模式并改善政府的预防、治疗、检测和护理计划。本研究使用多层感知器神经网络，使用菲律宾HIV/AIDS和ART注册处的统计数据，在COVID-19大流行袭击该国的期间预测时间序列。经过数据的训练、验证和测试，研究发现到2030年，该国的累积病例预计将达到145,273例。此外，观察值与预期的HIV流行之间几乎没有差异。",
