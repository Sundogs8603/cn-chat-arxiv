    "translated_abstract": "在当今数据丰富的环境中，推荐系统在决策支持系统中扮演着至关重要的角色。它们为用户提供个性化推荐和对这些推荐的解释。嵌入式模型尽管被广泛使用，但往往缺乏可解释性，这可能损害信任和用户参与度。本论文提出了一种将嵌入式和基于语义的模型相结合的方法，用于在推荐系统中生成事后解释，利用基于本体的知识图谱来提高可解释性。通过在一个结构化框架内组织数据，本体允许对实体之间的复杂关系进行建模，这对于生成解释是必不可少的。通过结合基于嵌入和基于语义的模型用于推荐系统中的事后解释，我们定义的框架旨在产生有意义且易于理解的解释，增强用户的信任和满意度，并潜在地增加推荐的可靠性和效果。",
