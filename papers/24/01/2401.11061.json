We propose to communicate photography suggestions to the user via a reference picture that is retrieved from a curated gallery. We exploit a visual language model (VLM) and an object detector to characterize reference pictures via textual descriptions and use a large language model (LLM) to retrieve relevant reference pictures based on a user's language query through text-based reasoning. To correspond the reference picture and the observed scene, we exploit pre-trained features from a vision transformer capable of capturing semantic similarity across significantly varying images. Using these features, we compute pose adjustments for an RGB-D camera by solving a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world manipulator equipped with a wrist camera. Our user studies show that photos taken by PhotoBo",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一个名为PhotoBot的框架，它基于高级人类语言引导和机器人摄影师之间的相互作用，用于自动化的照片获取。我们建议通过从策展画廊中检索到的参考图片向用户传达摄影建议。我们利用视觉语言模型（VLM）和物体检测器，通过文本描述对参考图片进行特征化，并使用大型语言模型（LLM）通过基于用户语言查询的文本推理检索相关的参考图片。为了对应参考图片和观察到的场景，我们利用一个能够捕捉显著不同的图像的语义相似性的预训练特征的视觉变换器，通过解决一个透视n-点（PnP）问题来计算RGB-D相机的姿态调整。我们在配备有手腕相机的真实机械手臂上演示了我们的方法。我们的用户研究表明，由PhotoBot拍摄的照片具有良好的质量和效果。",
