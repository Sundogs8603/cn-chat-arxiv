    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了最优输运（OT）理论与多智能体强化学习（MARL）的整合。该整合使用OT处理分布和运输问题，以提高MARL的效率、协调性和适应性。OT在以下五个关键领域可以影响MARL：（1）政策对齐，利用OT的Wasserstein度量来将不同的智能体策略对齐到统一的目标上；（2）分布式资源管理，利用OT来优化智能体之间的资源分配；（3）应对非平稳性，利用OT适应动态环境变化；（4）可扩展的多智能体学习，利用OT将大规模学习目标分解为可管理的任务；（5）提高能源效率，应用OT原则来开发可持续的MARL系统。本文阐述了OT与MARL之间的协同作用如何解决可扩展性问题、优化资源分配、在合作环境中对齐智能体策略。",
