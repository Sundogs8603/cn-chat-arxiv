    "translated_abstract": "波浪冲上是影响海滩洪水、海岸线变化和沿海结构损坏的关键因素。气候变化还预计将增加波浪冲上对沿海地区的影响。因此，快速准确地估计波浪冲上对于有效的沿海工程设计和管理至关重要。然而，由于过程的固有非线性和非平稳性，即使使用最先进的机器学习技术，预测时变的波浪冲上也具有挑战性。在本研究中，提出了一种基于物理信息的机器学习方法，以高效准确地模拟时序波浪冲上。该方法将Surfbeat (XBSB)模式的计算效率与XBeach模型的非静水压（XBNH）模式的准确性相结合。具体而言，采用条件生成对抗网络（cGAN）将XBSB的波浪冲上图像表示映射到相应的XBNH图像表示。这些图像表示使用光流方法进行时间变换并进行机器学习模型训练以实现波浪冲上预测。",
