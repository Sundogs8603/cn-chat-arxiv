In this paper, we study fairness in dynamic systems where sequential decisions are made. Each decision may shift the underlying distribution of features or user behavior. We model the dynamic system through a Markov Decision Process (MDP). By acknowledging that traditional fairness notions and long-term fairness are distinct requirements that may not necessarily align with one another, we propose an algorithmic framework to integrate various fairness considerations with reinforcement learning using both pre-processing and in-processing approaches. Three case studies show that our method can strike a balance between traditional fairness notions, long-term fairness, and utility.",

    "translated_abstract": "在公平机器学习领域取得了重大进展，但大多数研究集中在决策模型在静态人群上运行的情况下。本文研究了决策模型操作的人口是动态的情况下的公平性。每个决策可能会改变特征或用户行为的基础分布。我们通过马尔科夫决策过程（MDP）建模动态系统。在承认传统公平性概念和长期公平性是不同要求且可能不一致的情况下，我们提出了一种算法框架，将各种公平考虑与强化学习相结合，同时使用预处理和处理中的方法。三个案例研究显示我们的方法能够在传统公平性、长期公平性和效用之间取得平衡。",
