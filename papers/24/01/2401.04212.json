    "translated_abstract": "随着人造空间物体数量的快速增加，低地球轨道（LEO）面临着严重的拥塞问题，这给空间运营商带来了挑战，并威胁着空间环境的可持续性。目前用于研究这一演变的模型虽然详细，但计算量大。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新颖的基于机器学习的模型，作为MIT轨道能力工具（MOCAT）的延伸。这个先进模型旨在加速ASO密度分布的传播，并且它的训练基于由一个建立在已有精确模型的空间环境演化模拟生成的数百个实例。我们研究了不同的基于深度学习的解决方案，可以作为ASO传播的良好候选，并管理数据的高维度特点。为了评估模型的能力，我们在长期预测场景（约100年）进行实验，分析性能下降的原因和方式。",
