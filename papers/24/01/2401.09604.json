    "abstract": "Advancements in machine learning (ML) have significantly revolutionized medical image analysis, prompting hospitals to rely on external ML services. However, the exchange of sensitive patient data, such as chest X-rays, poses inherent privacy risks when shared with third parties. Addressing this concern, we propose MedBlindTuner, a privacy-preserving framework leveraging fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and a data-efficient image transformer (DEiT). MedBlindTuner enables the training of ML models exclusively on FHE-encrypted medical images. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that MedBlindTuner achieves comparable accuracy to models trained on non-encrypted images, offering a secure solution for outsourcing ML computations while preserving patient data privacy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses data-efficient image transformers and fully homomorphic encryption in this domain.",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习的进步显著改变了医学图像分析，促使医院依赖外部机器学习服务。然而，与第三方共享敏感患者数据，如胸部X射线，会存在固有的隐私风险。为解决这个问题，我们提出了MedBlindTuner，这是一个利用全同态加密和数据高效的图像转换器(DEiT)的隐私保护框架。MedBlindTuner使得机器学习模型仅在全同态加密的生物医学图像上进行训练。我们的实验评估表明，MedBlindTuner实现了与在非加密图像上训练的模型相当的准确度，为外包机器学习计算提供了安全的解决方案，同时保护了患者数据的隐私。据我们所知，这是第一个在该领域中使用数据高效图像转换器和全同态加密的工作。",
