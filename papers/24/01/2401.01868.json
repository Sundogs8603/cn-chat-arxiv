    "translated_abstract": "随着人口老龄化，许多辅助和监测技术正在开发中，以使老年人能够在家中养老。为了促进在家中养老，预测跌倒、住院等风险因素，并提供早期干预非常重要。目前，关于风险预测的环境监测工作主要集中在步态速度分析方面，利用隐私保护传感器如雷达来进行。尽管已有强有力的证据表明除步态速度外，步长的监测对于预测风险同样重要，但基于雷达的方法尚未研究在家庭环境中的步长测量。此外，基于雷达的步长测量实验仅限于几位健康受试者的概念验证研究。为了弥补这一空白，提出了一种基于雷达点云检测和跟踪、通过雷达多普勒速度对躯干进行分析以获取步长的家庭基于雷达的步长测量系统。",
