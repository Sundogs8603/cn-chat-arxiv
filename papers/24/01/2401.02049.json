    "translated_abstract": "本文对比特币回报序列进行了广泛分析，主要关注三种波动率指标：历史波动率（根据样本标准差计算）、预测波动率（根据GARCH模型导出）和隐含波动率（根据新兴的比特币期权市场计算）。这些波动率指标作为市场对条件波动率的预期指标，通过比较它们的差异和相似之处来阐明。本研究的核心发现强调了在所有采用的方法中，无论是日内还是年度基础上，预期波动率水平明显较高。然而，需要强调的是，比特币期权市场的流动性存在潜在挑战。这些流动性限制可能会导致隐含波动率的计算值出现差异，特别是在涉及极端货币性或到期期限的情况下。本分析提供了对比特币波动性的有价值洞察。",
