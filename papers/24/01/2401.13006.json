    "translated_abstract": "内容创作和图像编辑可以受益于用户的灵活控制。条件图像生成的常见中间表示是语义地图，其中包含图像中存在的对象的信息。与原始RGB像素相比，修改语义地图要容易得多。可以采用语义地图并轻松修改地图以选择性地插入、删除或替换地图中的对象。本文提出的方法接受修改后的语义地图，并根据修改后的地图调整原始图像。该方法利用传统的预训练图像到图像转换生成对抗网络（GAN），如CycleGAN或Pix2Pix GAN，在与语义地图相关的参考图像的有限数据集上进行微调。我们讨论了我们的技术的定性和定量性能，以说明它在图像伪造和图像编辑领域的能力和可能的应用。我们还展示了提议的图像伪造方法的有效性。",
