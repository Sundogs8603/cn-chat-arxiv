    "translated_abstract": "过去十年来，计算机领域取得了巨大的突破，而且没有迹象表明这种趋势会在短期内减慢。机器学习、大规模计算资源和增加的行业关注导致了对数据管理、模拟和模型生成的计算机驱动解决方案的投资增加。然而，随着计算能力的增长，数据的扩大也带来了数据存储、共享和追踪的复杂性。在这项工作中，我们介绍了一个名为ZnTrack的Python驱动数据版本控制工具。ZnTrack基于已建立的版本控制系统，提供了一个用户友好且易于使用的界面，用于跟踪实验中的参数、设计工作流、以及存储和共享数据。通过将大型数据集简化为一个简单的Python脚本，产生了“数据即代码”的概念，这是本文所介绍的工作的核心组成部分，也是计算时代继续演变的一个无疑重要的概念。ZnTrack提供了一种方法，可以将数据当作代码处理。",
