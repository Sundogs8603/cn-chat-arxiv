    "abstract": "To address the possible lack or total absence of pulses from particle detectors during the development of its associate electronics, we propose a model that can generate them without losing the features of the real ones. This model is based on artificial neural networks, namely Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). We describe the proposed network architecture, its training methodology and the approach to train the GAN with real pulses from a scintillator receiving radiation from sources of ${}^{137}$Cs and ${}^{22}$Na. The Generator was installed in a Xilinx's System-On-Chip (SoC). We show how the network is capable of generating pulses with the same shape as the real ones that even match the data distributions in the original pulse-height histogram data.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了解决在开发相关的电子设备期间粒子探测器可能缺乏或完全没有脉冲的问题，我们提出了一个模型，可以在不失去真实脉冲特征的情况下生成它们。该模型基于人工神经网络，即生成对抗网络（GAN）。我们描述了所提出的网络架构，其训练方法和使用来自显示闪烁晶体由${}^{137}$Cs和${}^{22}$Na放射源接收的真实脉冲来训练GAN的方法。生成器被安装在Xilinx的片上系统（SoC）中。我们展示了该网络能够生成与真实脉冲相同形状的脉冲，甚至与原始脉冲高度直方图数据的数据分布相匹配。",
