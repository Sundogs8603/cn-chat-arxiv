    "abstract": "In this paper, we design a real-time question-answering system specifically targeted for helping sellers get relevant material/documentation they can share live with their customers or refer to during a call. Taking the Seismic content repository as a relatively large scale example of a diverse dataset of sales material, we demonstrate how LLM embeddings of sellers' queries can be matched with the relevant content. We achieve this by engineering prompts in an elaborate fashion that makes use of the rich set of meta-features available for documents and sellers. Using a bi-encoder with cross-encoder re-ranker architecture, we show how the solution returns the most relevant content recommendations in just a few seconds even for large datasets. Our recommender system is deployed as an AML endpoint for real-time inferencing and has been integrated into a Copilot interface that is now deployed in the production version of the Dynamics CRM, known as MSX, used daily by Microsoft sellers.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文设计了一个实时问答系统，专门为销售人员提供有关材料/文档的实时推荐，以便与客户分享或在电话中参考。通过使用Seismic销售资料的相对较大规模的多样化数据集，我们展示了如何使用卖方查询的LLM嵌入与相关内容相匹配。我们通过以详细的方式设计提示语，并利用可用的丰富的文档和销售者元特征集，实现了这一目标。通过使用具有交叉编码器重排序器架构的双编码器，我们展示了该解决方案在仅几秒钟内即可返回最相关的内容推荐，即使对于大规模数据集也是如此。我们的推荐系统已部署为用于实时推理的AML端点，并已集成到Copilot界面中，该界面现已部署在每日由微软销售人员使用的Dynamics CRM的生产版本中(MSX）。",
