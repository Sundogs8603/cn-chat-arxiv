    "abstract": "We propose an innovative data-driven option pricing methodology that relies exclusively on the dataset of historical underlying asset prices. While the dataset is rooted in the objective world, option prices are commonly expressed as discounted expectations of their terminal payoffs in a risk-neutral world. Bridging this gap motivates us to identify a pricing kernel process, transforming option pricing into evaluating expectations in the objective world. We recover the pricing kernel by solving a utility maximization problem, and evaluate the expectations in terms of a functional optimization problem. Leveraging the deep learning technique, we design data-driven algorithms to solve both optimization problems over the dataset. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of our methodology.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种创新的基于数据驱动的期权定价方法，该方法仅仅依赖于历史标的资产价格的数据集。虽然数据集根植于客观世界，但期权价格通常被表达为在风险中性世界中的终端支付的折现期望。为了弥合这种差距，我们提出了一个定价内核过程，将期权定价转化为在客观世界中评估期望。我们通过解决一个效用最大化问题来恢复定价内核，并通过一个函数优化问题来评估期望。利用深度学习技术，我们设计了基于数据驱动的算法来解决数据集上的两个优化问题。通过数值实验展示了我们方法的有效性。",
