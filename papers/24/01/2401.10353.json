    "abstract": "One critical issue for chat systems is to stay consistent about preferences, opinions, beliefs and facts of itself, which has been shown a difficult problem. In this work, we study methods to assess and bolster utterance consistency of chat systems. A dataset is first developed for studying the inconsistencies, where inconsistent dialogue responses, explanations of the inconsistencies, and recovery utterances are authored by annotators. This covers the life span of inconsistencies, namely introduction, understanding, and resolution. Building on this, we introduce a set of tasks centered on dialogue consistency, specifically focused on its detection and resolution. Our experimental findings indicate that our dataset significantly helps the progress in identifying and resolving conversational inconsistencies, and current popular large language models like ChatGPT which are good at resolving inconsistencies however still struggle with detection.",

    "translated_abstract": "对话系统的一个关键问题是保持其自身的偏好、观点、信念和事实的一致性，这被证明是一个困难的问题。在本研究中，我们研究了评估和增强对话系统话语一致性的方法。首先，我们开发了一个数据集来研究不一致性，其中包括由注释者编写的不一致的对话回应、不一致性的解释和恢复话语。这涵盖了不一致性的生命周期，即引入、理解和解决。在此基础上，我们介绍了一组以对话一致性为中心的任务，具体关注其检测和解决。我们的实验结果表明，我们的数据集显著帮助了鉴别和解决对话不一致性的进展，并且目前流行的大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）在解决不一致性方面表现出良好的特点，但在检测方面仍然存在困难。",
