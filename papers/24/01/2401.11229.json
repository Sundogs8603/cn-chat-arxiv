    "abstract": "The paper introduces a new estimation method for the standard linear regression model. The procedure is not driven by the optimisation of any objective function rather, it is a simple weighted average of slopes from observation pairs. The paper shows that such estimator is consistent for carefully selected weights. Other properties, such as asymptotic distributions, have also been derived to facilitate valid statistical inference. Unlike traditional methods, such as Least Squares and Maximum Likelihood, among others, the estimated residual of this estimator is not by construction orthogonal to the explanatory variables of the model. This property allows a wide range of practical applications, such as the testing of endogeneity, i.e.,the correlation between the explanatory variables and the disturbance terms, and potentially several others.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种新的标准线性回归模型的估计方法。该方法没有优化任何目标函数，而是观测对斜率的简单加权平均。研究表明，通过精心选择权重，这样的估计量是一致的。为了方便进行有效的统计推断，还推导了渐近分布等其他属性。与传统的最小二乘法和最大似然法等方法不同，该估计器的估计残差在构造时不与模型的解释变量正交。这一特性允许广泛的实际应用，例如检验内生性，即解释变量与干扰项之间的相关性，以及其他可能的应用。",
