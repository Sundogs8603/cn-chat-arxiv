To overcome the limitations of existing databases that record disease-gene associations from existing literature, which often lack real-time updates, we propose a novel framework employing Large Language Models (LLMs) for the discovery of diseases associated with specific genes.

    "translated_abstract": "遗传变异与人类疾病之间错综复杂的关系一直是医学研究的焦点，这在特定疾病的风险基因确定方面得到了证实。先进的基因组测序技术的出现极大地提高了检测这些遗传标记的效率和经济性，对疾病诊断起到了关键作用，并成为临床决策和早期风险评估的基础。为了克服现有数据库的局限性，这些数据库从现有文献中记录疾病基因关联，通常缺乏实时更新，我们提出了一种采用大型语言模型（LLM）的新框架，用于发现与特定基因相关的疾病。该框架旨在自动化繁重的过程，通过筛选医学文献证据，将遗传变异与疾病联系起来，从而提高疾病识别的效率。我们的方法涉及使用LLMs进行...",
