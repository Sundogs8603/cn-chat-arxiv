    "translated_abstract": "数据有效学习旨在以最有效的方式利用数据来训练AI模型，其涉及关注数据质量而非数量的策略，确保用于训练的数据具有高信息价值。数据有效学习在加快AI训练、减少计算成本和节省数据存储方面发挥着重要作用，这在近年来医学数据的数量超出了许多人的预期时尤为重要。然而，由于缺乏标准和综合的基准研究，医学领域的数据有效学习研究还不够深入。为了填补这一空白，本文引入了一个专门用于评估医学领域数据有效学习的综合基准。该基准包括来自31个医疗中心数百万个数据样本的数据集(DataDEL)，用于比较的基准方法(MedDEL)，以及一个用于客观衡量数据有效学习性能的新评估指标(NormDEL)。我们进行了广泛的实证实验和比较，证明了我们的基准在评估数据有效学习方面的有效性和适用性。",
