    "abstract": "In the context of whether investors are aware of carbon-related risks, it is often hypothesized that there may be a carbon premium in the value of stocks of firms, conferring an abnormal excess value to firms' shares as a form of compensation to investors for their transition risk exposure through the ownership of carbon instensive stocks. However, there is little consensus in the literature regarding the existence of such a premium. Moreover few studies have examined whether the correlation that is often observed is actually causal. The pertinent question is whether more polluting firms give higher returns or do firms with high returns have less incentive to decarbonize? In this study, we investigate whether firms' emissions is causally linked to the presence of a carbon premium in a panel of 141 firms listed in the S\\&P500 index using fixed-effects analysis, with propensity score weighting to control for selection bias in which firms increase their emissions.

    "translated_abstract": "在投资者是否意识到碳相关风险的背景下，通常有一种假设认为，公司股票的价值中可能存在一个碳溢价，以对投资者通过持有碳密集型股票而承担的转型风险暴露进行补偿。然而，关于是否存在这样一种溢价，学术界尚未达成一致意见。此外，很少有研究考察到通常被观察到的相关性是否真正具有因果关系。关键问题是：排放更多的公司是否提供较高的回报，还是回报较高的公司是否缺乏减缓碳排放的动力？在本研究中，我们使用固定效应分析和倾向评分加权，研究了在S&P500指数上列出的141家公司的排放是否与碳溢价的存在有因果关联，并控制了因公司选择增加排放而产生的选择偏差。我们发现存在一种",
