    "abstract": "This paper introduces the WordArt Designer API, a novel framework for user-driven artistic typography synthesis utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) on ModelScope. We address the challenge of simplifying artistic typography for non-professionals by offering a dynamic, adaptive, and computationally efficient alternative to traditional rigid templates. Our approach leverages the power of LLMs to understand and interpret user input, facilitating a more intuitive design process. We demonstrate through various case studies how users can articulate their aesthetic preferences and functional requirements, which the system then translates into unique and creative typographic designs. Our evaluations indicate significant improvements in user satisfaction, design flexibility, and creative expression over existing systems. The WordArt Designer API not only democratizes the art of typography but also opens up new possibilities for personalized digital communication and design.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了WordArt设计师API，这是一个利用模型范围上的大型语言模型进行用户驱动的艺术字体合成的新框架。我们通过提供动态、自适应和计算效果高的替代传统刚性模板的方案，解决了非专业人士简化艺术字体的挑战。我们的方法利用LLMs的能力来理解和解释用户输入，促进更直观的设计过程。通过各种案例研究，我们展示了用户如何表达他们的审美偏好和功能需求，系统然后将其转化为独特且富有创意的字体设计。我们的评估结果表明，与现有系统相比，用户满意度、设计灵活性和创造性表达都有显著改进。WordArt设计师API不仅使字体艺术民主化，还为个性化数字通信和设计打开了新的可能性。",
