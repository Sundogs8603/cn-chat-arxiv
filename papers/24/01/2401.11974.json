    "translated_abstract": "合规风险控制（CRC）是一种最近提出的技术，它应用于传统的点预测器上，以提供校准保证。在CRC中推广一致性预测（CP），通过从点预测器中提取一个预测器集合来控制风险函数（如误覆盖概率或错误负例率），从而确保校准性。原始的CRC需要将可用数据集分为训练和验证数据集。当数据可用性有限时，这可能导致预测器集合效率低下。本文介绍了一种基于交叉验证而不是原始CRC的新型CRC方法。所提出的交叉验证CRC（CV-CRC）将CP的一种版本扩展到CRC，可以控制更广泛的风险函数。CV-CRC被证明在预测器集合的平均风险上具有理论保证。此外，通过数值实验证明CV-CRC在实践中的有效性。",
