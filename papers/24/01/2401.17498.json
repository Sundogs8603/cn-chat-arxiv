    "translated_abstract": "QA模型面临着复杂而开放的上下文推理问题，但通常可以通过利用训练数据中特定于数据集的模式来学习高性能的解决启发式方法。这些模式，或者称为\"数据集伪迹\"，降低了模型在现实世界QA问题上的泛化能力。利用训练用于QA的ElectraSmallDiscriminator模型，我们使用一组对抗性挑战数据集分析了数据集伪迹的影响和发生情况，该数据集旨在混淆依赖于数据集伪迹进行预测的模型。在现有减轻伪迹影响方法的基础上，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，即地图接种，通过在优化的挑战数据子集上对模型进行微调，以减少模型对数据集伪迹的依赖性。我们证明，通过有选择地在挑战数据集中的模棱两可的对抗性示例上进行模型微调，可以在最小损失模型对其他挑战数据集的泛化能力的情况下，大大提高模型在整个挑战数据集上的性能。",
