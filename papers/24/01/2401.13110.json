    "translated_abstract": "可解释的人工智能（XAI）领域通常关注具有较强技术背景的用户，这使得非专家难以理解XAI方法。本文介绍了“x-[plAIn]”，一种通过使用ChatGPT Builder开发的自定义大型语言模型（LLM），使XAI对更广泛的受众更易于访问的新方法。我们的目标是设计一个模型，可以针对不同的用户群体，包括商业专业人士和学术界人士，生成清晰、简明的各种XAI方法的总结。我们模型的关键特点是其能够根据每个用户群体的知识水平和兴趣来适应解释。我们的方法仍然能够提供及时的见解，为最终用户的决策过程提供便利。我们的使用案例研究结果表明，我们的模型在提供易于理解的、针对特定受众的解释方面非常有效，不论使用何种XAI方法，这种适应性提高了XAI的可访问性，弥补了差距。",
