    "translated_abstract": "检测遥感图像中的云和雪是遥感图像的重要预处理任务。以前的工作借鉴了计算机视觉中的语义分割模型，大部分研究集中在改进模型结构以提高检测性能。然而，与自然图像不同，遥感图像中场景的复杂性和云类型的多样性导致云和雪检测数据集中存在许多不准确的标签，导致训练和测试过程中引入了不必要的噪声。通过构建一个新的数据集并提出一种新的训练策略，即课程学习模式，我们引导模型减少对噪声标签的过拟合。此外，我们设计了一种更合适的模型性能评估方法，缓解了由噪声标签引起的性能评估偏差。通过在UNet和Segformer模型上进行实验，我们验证了我们提出的方法的有效性。",
