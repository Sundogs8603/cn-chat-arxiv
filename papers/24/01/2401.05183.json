    "abstract": "The impact of strikes in educational institutions, specifically universities, on employers remains understudied. This paper investigates the impact of education strikes in UK universities from 2018 to 2022, primarily due to pension disputes. Using data from the Guardian University Guide and the 2014 and 2021 Research Excellence Frameworks and leveraging difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity approaches, our findings suggest significant declines in several student related outcomes, such as student satisfaction, and a more mixed picture for student attainment and research performance. These results highlight the substantial, albeit indirect, cost unions can impose on university employers during strikes.",

    "translated_abstract": "研究教育机构，特别是大学罢工对雇主的影响仍然不足。本文调查了2018年至2022年英国大学的教育罢工对雇主的影响，主要是因为养老金纠纷。利用《卫报大学指南》和2014年和2021年的研究卓越框架的数据及差异分析和回归不连续法，我们的研究结果表明，在一些与学生有关的结果上出现了显著下降，如学生满意度，而学生成绩和研究绩效的情况则较为复杂。这些结果突显出工会在罢工期间对大学雇主造成的实质性但间接的成本。",
