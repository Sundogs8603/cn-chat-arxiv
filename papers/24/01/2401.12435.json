    "translated_abstract": "大脑的细胞外间隙 (ECS)是位于细胞之间或细胞与血管之间的不规则、极其迂回的纳米级空间，对神经细胞的生存至关重要。它在记忆、情绪和感觉等高级脑功能中起着关键作用。然而，ECS内分子传输的具体形式仍然不清楚。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种新的方法，通过使用物理信息神经网络 (PINN) 解决从对流-扩散方程 (ADE) 导出的一个逆问题，定量分析ECS内的分子传输。PINN为ADE提供了一个简化的解决方案，而无需复杂的数学公式或网格设置。此外，PINN的优化功能可自动计算决定长期分子传输的扩散系数和由对流驱动的分子速度。因此，所提出的方法允许进行定量分析。",
