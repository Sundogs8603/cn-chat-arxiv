    "translated_abstract": "合成控制方法通常用于只有一个处理单元和少数对照单元的问题。在这种情况下，一种常见的推断任务是测试关于对待处理单元的平均处理效应的零假设。由于（1）样本量较小导致大样本近似不稳定和（2）在实践中实施的估计过程的简化，因此通常无法满足渐近合理性的推断程序常常不令人满意。一种替代方法是置换推断，它与常见的称为安慰剂测试的诊断相关。当治疗均匀分配时，它在有限样本中具有可证明的 Type-I 错误保证，而无需简化方法。尽管具有这种健壮性，安慰剂测试由于只从 $N$ 个参考估计构造零分布，其中 $N$ 是样本量，因此分辨率较低。这在常见的水平 $\\alpha = 0.05$ 的统计推断中形成了一个障碍，特别是在小样本问题中。",
