    "title": "Attack and Reset for Unlearning: Exploiting Adversarial Noise toward Machine Unlearning through Parameter Re-initialization. (arXiv:2401.08998v1 [cs.LG])",
    "abstract": "With growing concerns surrounding privacy and regulatory compliance, the concept of machine unlearning has gained prominence, aiming to selectively forget or erase specific learned information from a trained model. In response to this critical need, we introduce a novel approach called Attack-and-Reset for Unlearning (ARU). This algorithm leverages meticulously crafted adversarial noise to generate a parameter mask, effectively resetting certain parameters and rendering them unlearnable. ARU outperforms current state-of-the-art results on two facial machine-unlearning benchmark datasets, MUFAC and MUCAC. In particular, we present the steps involved in attacking and masking that strategically filter and re-initialize network parameters biased towards the forget set. Our work represents a significant advancement in rendering data unexploitable to deep learning models through parameter re-initialization, achieved by harnessing adversarial noise to craft a mask.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着隐私和监管合规方面的关注不断增加，机器遗忘的概念日益重要，旨在选择性地忘记或删除训练模型中的特定学习信息。针对这一迫切需求，我们引入了一种称为攻击和重置用于遗忘（ARU）的新方法。该算法利用精心设计的对抗性噪声生成参数蒙版，有效地重置某些参数并使其无法学习。ARU在两个面部机器遗忘基准数据集MUFAC和MUCAC上优于当前最先进的结果。我们特别介绍了攻击和蒙版的步骤，这些步骤过滤和重置对忘记集有偏见的网络参数。我们的工作通过利用对抗性噪声来设计蒙版，在通过参数重新初始化方面取得了使数据对深度学习模型不可利用的显著进展。",
