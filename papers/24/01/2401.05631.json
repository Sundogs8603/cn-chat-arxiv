    "abstract": "We introduce an interactive approach, DrawTalking, in which the user builds interactive worlds by sketching and speaking. It emphasizes user control and flexibility, and gives programming-like capability without code. We implemented it on the iPad. An open-ended study shows the mechanics resonate and are applicable to many creative-exploratory use cases. We hope to inspire and inform research in future natural user-centered interfaces.",
