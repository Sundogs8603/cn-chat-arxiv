    "abstract": "This research explores a relatively unexplored area of predicting cryptocurrency staking rewards, offering potential insights to researchers and investors. We investigate two predictive methodologies: a) a straightforward sliding-window average, and b) linear regression models predicated on historical data. The findings reveal that ETH staking rewards can be forecasted with an RMSE within 0.7% and 1.1% of the mean value for 1-day and 7-day look-aheads respectively, using a 7-day sliding-window average approach. Additionally, we discern diverse prediction accuracies across various cryptocurrencies, including SOL, XTZ, ATOM, and MATIC. Linear regression is identified as superior to the moving-window average for perdicting in the short term for XTZ and ATOM. The results underscore the generally stable and predictable nature of staking rewards for most assets, with MATIC presenting a noteworthy exception.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探索了一个相对未被探索的领域，即预测加密货币质押奖励，为研究人员和投资者提供潜在的洞察。我们研究了两种预测方法：a）简单的滑动窗口平均法，和b）基于历史数据的线性回归模型。研究结果表明，使用7天滑动窗口平均法，ETH质押奖励可以在1天和7天的预测中，预测误差均在均值的0.7%和1.1%之间。此外，我们还发现不同加密货币（包括SOL、XTZ、ATOM和MATIC）的预测准确度存在差异。对于XTZ和ATOM，线性回归方法在短期预测中被认为优于滑动窗口平均法。结果强调了大多数资产的质押奖励通常是稳定可预测的，而MATIC则是一个值得注意的异常情况。",
