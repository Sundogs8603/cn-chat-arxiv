The information set includes a stationary regressand and a node-specific vector of nonstationary regressors, both observed at the same equally spaced time frequencies. Our proposed econometric specification correponds to the NVAR model under time series nonstationarity which relies on the local-to-unity parametrization for capturing the unknown form of persistence of these node-specific regressors. Robust econometric estimation is achieved using an IVX-type estimator and the asymptotic theory analysis for the augmented vector of regressors is studied based on a double asymptotic regime where both the network size and the time dimension tend to infinity.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究具有非平稳回归变量的网络向量自回归模型的识别和估计。特别地，网络依赖关系由非随机邻接矩阵描绘。信息集包括一个平稳回归变量和一个特定节点的非平稳回归向量，两者在相同的均匀间隔时间频率下观测。我们提出的计量经济规范对应于基于局部到单位参数化的NVAR模型，用于捕捉这些节点特定回归变量的未知持续性形式。通过使用IVX类型的估计器实现了鲁棒计量经济估计，并基于双渐近区域研究了扩展回归变量的渐近理论分析，其中网络规模和时间维度都趋近于无穷大。",
