    "translated_abstract": "由于时间序列的非平稳性，分布偏移问题很大程度上阻碍了时间序列预测的性能。现有的解决方案要么无法处理超出简单统计的偏移，要么与预测模型的兼容性有限。在本文中，我们提出了一种针对时间序列预测的通用解耦公式，不依赖于固定统计数据，也不限制于预测架构。然后，我们将这种公式形式化为一个双层优化问题，以实现转换（外循环）和预测（内循环）的联合学习。此外，对于转换而言，对表达能力和双向性的特殊要求促使我们提出了实例规范化流（IN-Flow），一种新颖的可逆网络用于时间序列转换。大量实验证明我们的方法在合成数据和真实数据上始终优于最先进的基线模型。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method to address the distribution shift problem in time series forecasting using instance normalization flows, which does not rely on fixed statistics and is compatible with various forecasting architectures. The method involves a bi-level optimization problem for joint learning of transformation and forecasting, and introduces instance normalization flows as a novel invertible network for time series transformation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both synthetic and real-world data."
