    "translated_abstract": "滑坡灾害的最常用定义结合了滑坡位置的空间信息（易发性）、威胁程度（强度）和频率（重现期）。在处理大范围地区时，通常只考虑和估计前两个元素。即便如此，分离的模型仍是标准，对频率的研究很少。频率和强度相互交织并相互依赖，因为更大规模的事件发生的频率较低，反之亦然。然而，由于缺乏多时期清单和联合统计模型，通过统一的灾害模型对这些属性进行建模一直是具有挑战性的，尚未尝试过。在这里，我们开发了一个统一模型，以单元坡度水平估计滑坡灾害，以解决这些差距。我们采用深度学习结合极值理论驱动的模型，分析了尼泊尔30年土壤降雨引发滑坡的清单，并评估了多个地区的滑坡灾害。",
    "tldr": "该论文通过使用深度学习和极值理论驱动的模型，开发了一个统一的方法来估计滑坡灾害。这种方法将滑坡位置的空间信息、威胁程度和频率结合起来，填补了目前在处理大范围地区时仅考虑两个元素的不足之处。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper develops a unified approach to estimate landslide hazard by combining spatial information, threat intensity, and frequency using deep learning and a model based on extreme-value theory, filling the gap in the current practice of considering only two elements when working over vast areas."
