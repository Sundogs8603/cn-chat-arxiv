Three main complexity-related research trends in quantitative linguistics are covered. The first part addresses the issue of word frequencies in texts and demonstrates that taking punctuation into consideration restores scaling whose violation in the Zipf's law is often observed for the most frequent words. The second part introduces methods inspired by time series analysis, used in studying various kinds of correlations in written texts. The related time series are generated on the basis of text partition into sentences or into phrases between consecutive punctuation marks.

    "translated_abstract": "这篇综述从复杂性科学的角度总结了研究自然语言所使用的主要方法论概念，并记录了它们在识别语言在书面表达中的通用特征和系统特定特征方面的适用性。涵盖了数量语言学中与复杂性相关的三个主要研究趋势。第一部分讨论了文本中的词频问题，并证明考虑标点符号可以恢复违反Zipf定律的最常见词语的比例。第二部分介绍了受时间序列分析启发的方法，用于研究书面文本中的各种相关性。相关时间序列是基于将文本分割为句子或连续标点之间的短语而生成的。结果表明，这些序列具有复杂系统生成的信号中常见的长程相关性或（多）分形特征。",
