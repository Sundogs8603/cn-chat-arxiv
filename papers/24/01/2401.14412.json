    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络（DNN）已经成为解决现实世界问题的有效方法。然而，像人类编写的软件一样，DNN也容易受到错误和攻击的影响。这引发了对有效和可扩展的DNN验证技术和工具的重大关注。本文介绍了VeriStable，这是一种新颖的基于DPLL约束DNN验证方法的扩展。VeriStable利用了这样一个洞见：尽管神经元在整个DNN输入空间中的行为可能是非线性的，在验证过程中计算得到的中间状态中，许多神经元可能被约束为具有线性行为-这些神经元是稳定的。高效地检测稳定的神经元可以减少组合复杂性，而不会损害抽象的准确性。此外，DNN验证问题中产生的子句结构与工业化SAT基准具有重要特征。我们调整并融合了多线程和重启优化策略。",
