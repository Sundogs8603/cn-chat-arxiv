    "translated_abstract": "解析不同尺度时间模式之间的相互作用对于精确的长期时间序列预测至关重要。然而，先前的工作缺乏对高阶相互作用的建模能力。为了促进更全面的模式相互作用建模用于长期时间序列预测，我们提出了一个多尺度超图转换器（MSHyper）框架。具体而言，引入了一个多尺度超图来提供高阶模式相互作用建模的基础。然后，通过将超边视为节点，我们还构建了一个超边图来增强超图建模。此外，引入了一个三阶段的消息传递机制来聚合模式信息并学习不同尺度时间模式之间的相互作用强度。在五个真实世界的数据集上进行了大量实验，结果表明，MSHyper在均方误差(MSE)和平均绝对误差(MAE)方面实现了最先进的性能，平均减小了8.73%和7.15%的预测误差。",
