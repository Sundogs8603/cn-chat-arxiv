    "translated_abstract": "遥感图像变化检测旨在检测同一地方拍摄的两个时期的图像之间的差异。深度学习已被广泛应用于遥感图像变化检测任务，在结果识别方面取得了显著成果。然而，由于卫星的拍摄角度、薄云层的影响以及特定的光照条件，在一些遥感摄影中，变化区域的模糊边缘问题无法通过当前的遥感图像变化检测算法正确处理。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种身体解耦多尺度特征聚合变化检测（BD-MSA）的新模型，在训练和预测阶段在特征图的通道和空间维度中收集全局和局部特征图信息。这种方法允许我们成功提取变化区域的边界信息，并将变化区域的主体与其边界分离。许多研究表明，评估指标是评价遥感图像变化检测结果质量的重要标准。",
