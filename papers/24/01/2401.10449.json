    "translated_abstract": "端到端自动语音识别方法表现出出色的性能。然而，由于这些方法的性能与训练数据中的上下文密切相关，对于未知用户上下文（例如技术术语、个人姓名和播放列表），端到端自动语音识别方法无法实现预期的效果。因此，端到端自动语音识别方法必须能够轻松进行上下文化。本文提出了一种基于注意力的上下文偏差方法，可以使用可编辑的短语列表（称为偏差列表）进行定制。所提出的方法可以通过结合偏差短语索引损失和特殊标记来有效地训练，以便在输入语音数据中检测偏差短语。此外，为了进一步改善推理过程中的上下文化性能，我们提出了一种基于偏差短语索引概率的偏差短语增强束搜索算法。实验结果表明，所提出的方法始终可以改善字错误率。",
