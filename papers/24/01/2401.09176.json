In the present study, we introduce a unified deep learning framework called ADCNet to help design potential ADCs. The ADCNet highly integrates the protein representation learning language model ESM-2 and small-molecule representation learning language model FG-BERT models to achieve activity prediction through learning meaningful features from antigen and antibody protein sequences of ADC, SMILES strings of linker and payload, and drug-antibody ratio (DAR) value.

    "translated_abstract": "抗体药物复合物（ADC）由于其精确靶向癌细胞并释放高效药物的能力，已经在精准医学时代彻底改变了癌症治疗领域。然而，由于ADC的结构与活性之间的关系难以理解，因此合理设计ADC非常困难。在本研究中，我们介绍了一个名为ADCNet的统一深度学习框架，帮助设计潜在的ADC。ADCNet集成了蛋白质表示学习语言模型ESM-2和小分子表示学习语言模型FG-BERT，通过学习ADC的抗原和抗体蛋白质序列、连接物和药物的SMILES序列，以及药物-抗体比（DAR）值的有意义特征，实现了活性预测。根据精心设计和手动调整的ADC数据集，广泛的评估结果表明，与基准相比，ADCNet在测试集上表现最佳。",
