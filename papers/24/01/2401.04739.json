    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，自由手绘草图的识别一直是一个热门任务。然而，在一些特殊领域如军事领域，很难大规模采样自由手绘草图。常见的数据增强和图像生成技术很难产生具有各种自由手绘风格的图像。因此，相关领域中的识别和分割任务受到限制。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的对抗生成网络，可以准确地生成具有各种风格的逼真自由手绘草图。我们探索了模型的性能，包括使用从先验正态分布中随机采样的风格来生成具有各种自由手绘风格的图像，从已知的自由手绘草图中解开画家的风格，以生成具有特定风格的图像，以及生成不在训练集中的未知类别的图像。我们进一步通过定性和定量评估证明我们的优势。",
