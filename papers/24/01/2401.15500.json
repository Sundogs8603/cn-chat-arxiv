    "translated_abstract": "分类是许多应用中的一个基本任务，数据驱动方法已经显示出了出色的性能。然而，确定这些方法是否达到了最佳性能是具有挑战性的。这主要是因为通常无法知道最佳可达性能，因此有效地估计它是非常重要的。在本文中，我们考虑二分类问题，并提出了一个对于给定数据集中贝叶斯分类器的误报率（FPR）的估计方法，即相对于准确率而言最优的分类器。我们的方法利用了软标签或者实值标签，由于其特性，软标签正在获得显着的关注。我们对我们的估计器的各种理论性质进行了彻底的研究，包括其一致性、无偏性、收敛速度和方差。为了增强我们的估计器在软标签之外的通用性，我们还考虑了包含二元标签的有噪声标签。",
