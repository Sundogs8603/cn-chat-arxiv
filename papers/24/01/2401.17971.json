    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们评估了意大利于2018年引入的一项改革（Decreto Dignit\\`a）的影响，该改革增加了对临时雇佣的雇佣保护法规（EPL）的刚性，并回滚了以前的政策，以减少工作不稳定性。我们使用2016年至2019年的纵向劳动力数据，并在Rubin Casual Model（RCM）框架内采用时间序列技术来估计改革的因果效应。我们发现该改革成功地减少了对临时就业的持续性，并增加了从临时就业转为正式就业的流动，特别是在意大利北部的女性和年轻工人中，对正式就业的存量产生了显著影响（+），临时就业（-）和失业（-）。然而，这一积极的结果是以男性和低教育水平劳动者更高的不活跃持续性、失业到临时就业的流出减少以及失业到不活跃的流出增加为代价的。",
