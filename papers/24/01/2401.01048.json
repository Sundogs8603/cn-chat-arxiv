    "abstract": "This paper presents a series of new results for domain adaptation in the multi-view learning setting. The incorporation of multiple views in the domain adaptation was paid little attention in the previous studies. In this way, we propose an analysis of generalization bounds with Pac-Bayesian theory to consolidate the two paradigms, which are currently treated separately. Firstly, building on previous work by Germain et al., we adapt the distance between distribution proposed by Germain et al. for domain adaptation with the concept of multi-view learning. Thus, we introduce a novel distance that is tailored for the multi-view domain adaptation setting. Then, we give Pac-Bayesian bounds for estimating the introduced divergence. Finally, we compare the different new bounds with the previous studies.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文在多视图学习设置中提出了一系列关于领域自适应的新结果。在以往的研究中，很少关注将多个视图纳入领域自适应的方法。因此，我们提出了一种基于Pac-Bayesian理论的泛化界限分析，以整合目前分开处理的两种范式。首先，我们根据Germain等人的以往研究，将其提出的分布之间的距离用于多视图学习的领域自适应，从而引入了一种适用于多视图领域自适应设置的新型距离。然后，我们给出了用于估计引入的差异的Pac-Bayesian界限。最后，我们将不同的新界限与以前的研究进行了比较。",
