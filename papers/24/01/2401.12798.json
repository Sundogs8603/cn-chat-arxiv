    "translated_abstract": "实体对齐（EA）是在集成多源知识图谱（KGs）中的关键过程，旨在识别这些图谱中的等价实体对。大多数现有方法将EA视为图表示学习任务，专注于增强图编码器。然而，在EA中解码过程-对于有效的操作和对齐准确性至关重要-得到了有限的关注，并且仍然针对特定数据集和模型架构进行定制，需要实体和额外的显式关系嵌入。这种特殊性限制了它的适用性，尤其是在基于GNN的模型中。为了填补这一空白，我们引入了一种新颖、通用和高效的EA解码方法，仅依赖于实体嵌入。我们的方法通过最小化狄利克雷能量来优化解码过程，在图内引导梯度流，以促进图同质性。梯度流的离散化产生了一种快速可扩展的方法，称为三元特征。",
