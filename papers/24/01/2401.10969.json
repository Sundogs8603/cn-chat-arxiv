    "translated_abstract": "群体行为工程是一项旨在研究协调简单智能体团体内计算和行动的方法和技术，以实现复杂的全局目标，如图案形成、集体移动、聚类和分布式感知。尽管在群体（无人机、机器人、车辆）分析和工程方面取得了一些进展，但仍然需要通用的设计和实现方法和工具，以系统化的方式定义复杂的群体行为。为了对此做出贡献，本文提出了一种新的基于场的协调方法，称为MacroSwarm，以可重用且完全可组合的功能模块为基础，嵌入集体计算和协调。基于集成计算的宏编程范式，MacroSwarm提出了将每个群体行为块表示为将感知场映射为执行目标场的纯函数的思路。",

    "en_tdlr": "MacroSwarm is a field-based framework for swarm programming that enables the design and implementation of complex swarm behavior through reusable and composable functional blocks. By mapping sensing fields to actuation goal fields, MacroSwarm provides a systematic approach to defining and implementing swarm behavior."
