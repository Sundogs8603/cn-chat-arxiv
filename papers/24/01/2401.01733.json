    "abstract": "Leakages are a major risk in water distribution networks as they cause water loss and increase contamination risks. Leakage detection is a difficult task due to the complex dynamics of water distribution networks. In particular, small leakages are hard to detect. From a machine-learning perspective, leakages can be modeled as concept drift. Thus, a wide variety of drift detection schemes seems to be a suitable choice for detecting leakages. In this work, we explore the potential of model-loss-based and distribution-based drift detection methods to tackle leakage detection. We additionally discuss the issue of temporal dependencies in the data and propose a way to cope with it when applying distribution-based detection. We evaluate different methods systematically for leakages of different sizes and detection times. Additionally, we propose a first drift-detection-based technique for localizing leakages.",

    "translated_abstract": "泄漏是水配水网络中的重大风险，因为它们导致水资源的损失并增加了污染风险。泄漏检测是一项困难的任务，由于水配水网络的复杂动力学。特别是，很难检测到小泄漏。从机器学习的角度来看，泄漏可以被建模为概念漂移。因此，一种广泛的漂移检测方案似乎是检测泄漏的合适选择。在这项工作中，我们探讨了基于模型损失和基于分布的漂移检测方法在处理泄漏检测方面的潜力。我们还讨论了数据中的时序依赖问题，并提出了一种处理这个问题的方法，当应用基于分布的检测时。我们系统地评估了不同方法对不同大小和检测时间的泄漏。此外，我们提出了一种基于漂移检测的技术来定位泄漏。",
