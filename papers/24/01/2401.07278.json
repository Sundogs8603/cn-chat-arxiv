    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, especially in white blood cell cancer diagnosis, is hindered by two primary challenges: the lack of large-scale labeled datasets for white blood cell (WBC) segmentation and outdated segmentation methods. To address the first challenge, a semi-supervised learning framework should be brought to efficiently annotate the large dataset. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a novel self-training pipeline with the incorporation of FixMatch. We discover that by incorporating FixMatch in the self-training pipeline, the performance improves in the majority of cases. Our performance achieved the best performance with the self-training scheme with consistency on DeepLab-V3 architecture and ResNet-50, reaching 90.69%, 87.37%, and 76.49% on Zheng 1, Zheng 2, and LISC datasets, respectively.",

    "translated_abstract": "在医疗保健领域，特别是在白细胞癌症诊断中，人工智能（AI）受到两个主要挑战的阻碍：缺乏大规模的白细胞（WBC）分割的标记数据集和过时的分割方法。为了解决第一个挑战，应该引入一种半监督学习框架来高效地注释大数据集。在这项工作中，我们通过提出一种新颖的自训练流程并结合FixMatch来解决这个问题。我们发现，通过在自训练流程中结合FixMatch，大多数情况下性能得到了改善。我们的性能在DeepLab-V3架构和ResNet-50上采用了自训练方案和一致性，分别在Zheng 1、Zheng 2和LISC数据集上达到了90.69%、87.37%和76.49%。",
