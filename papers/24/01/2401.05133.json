    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在n个玩家 general-sum 游戏中寻找均衡的计算方法，特别是那些涉及复杂的视觉运动技能。我们展示了现有方法在这种情况下要么在计算上困难，要么在理论上面临困难。然后，我们引入了 NeuPL-JPSRO，一种神经群体学习算法，该算法通过技能的迁移学习，收敛到游戏的粗略相关均衡 (Coarse Correlated Equilibrium)。我们在一系列的 OpenSpiel 游戏中展示了实证收敛性，并由精确的游戏求解器进行了严格验证。然后，我们将 NeuPL-JPSRO 应用于复杂的领域，在 MuJoCo 控制领域实现了自适应协调和 capture-the-flag 中的技能迁移。我们的工作表明，可以在规模和普遍性上实现收敛于均衡的群体学习，为解决异质玩家、具有混合动机的现实世界游戏铺平了道路。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study investigates computationally efficient methods for finding equilibria in n-player general-sum games, and proposes a neural population learning algorithm, NeuPL-JPSRO, that converges to a Coarse Correlated Equilibrium through transfer learning of skills. The algorithm is validated by empirical convergence in a suite of games and demonstrated applicability in complex domains. This research provides a new approach to solving real-world games between heterogeneous players with mixed motives."
