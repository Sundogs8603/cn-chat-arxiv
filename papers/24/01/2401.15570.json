For solving that numerically, one must truncate the domain and impose an artificial boundary data. By deriving an estimate of the domain truncation error at all the points in the truncated domain, we extend some results in the literature those deal with option pricing equation under constant regime case only. We differ from the existing approach to obtain the error estimate that is sharper in certain region of the domain. Hence, the minimum of proposed and existing gives a strictly sharper estimate. A comprehensive comparison with the existing literature is carried out by considering some numerical examples. Those examples confirm that the improvement in the error estimates is significant.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文详细研究了在一个制度切换市场模型下涉及欧式期权定价的多维抛物型偏微分方程系统。为了对其进行数值求解，必须对域进行截断并施加人工边界数据。通过对截断域中所有点的域截断误差进行估计，我们扩展了现有文献中仅考虑恒定制度情况下的期权定价方程的一些结果。我们采用了一种与现有方法不同的方法来获得误差估计，在域的某个区域内具有更高的精度。因此，我们提出的误差估计和现有方法之间的最小值得到了严格更精确的估计。通过考虑一些数值例子，我们进行了与现有文献的全面比较。这些例子证实了误差估计的改进是显著的。",
