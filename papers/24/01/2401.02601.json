This model, which minimizes maximum portfolio drawdown, is particularly appealing during times of financial distress, like during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we will present a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming variation of our new model that, based on our out-of-sample results and sensitivity analysis, delivers a more profitable and robust solution with a 200 times faster solving time compared to the standard Markowitz quadratic formulation.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于最大回撤的替代线性化方法，用于经典的Markowitz二次投资组合优化模型。该模型通过最小化最大投资组合回撤，在金融困境时特别有吸引力，例如COVID-19疫情期间。此外，我们还将介绍我们新模型的混合整数线性规划变体，根据我们的趋势外样本结果和敏感性分析，该模型比标准的Markowitz二次优化模型提供更具盈利性和鲁棒性的解决方案，并且求解时间快200倍。",
