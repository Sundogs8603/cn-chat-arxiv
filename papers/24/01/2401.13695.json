    "translated_abstract": "颗粒流中的反演问题，如山体滑坡和碎屑流，涉及基于目标波动剖面估计材料参数或边界条件。传统的高保真度模拟器对这些反演问题是计算密集型的，限制了可能的模拟次数。此外，它们的不可微性使得梯度优化方法无法应用，而这些方法在高维问题中以其效率而闻名。虽然基于机器学习的代理模型提供了计算效率和可微性，但由于其依赖于低维输入-输出映射，无法捕捉到颗粒流的完整物理过程，因此往往难以推广到训练数据之外。我们提出了一种新颖的可微分图神经网络模拟器(GNS)，通过将图神经网络的反向模式自动微分与基于梯度的优化相结合，用于解决反演问题。GNS学习了颗粒流的动力学特性。",
