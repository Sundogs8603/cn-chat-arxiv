    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的机器学习方法，用于构建多类可解释评分系统（MISS）- 一种完全数据驱动的方法，用于生成单一、稀疏和用户友好的多类分类问题的评分系统。评分系统通常用作医疗保健、刑事司法和其他领域的决策支持模型，其中预测的解释性和易用性至关重要。以前用于数据驱动评分的方法，如SLIM（超稀疏线性整数模型），仅限于二元分类任务，而对于多类领域的扩展主要通过一对多技术实现。我们的方法产生的评分可以通过softmax函数轻松转换为类别概率。我们演示了降维和启发式技术，提高了训练效率并减少了最佳模型之间的差距，该差距可以证明模型的最佳性。",
