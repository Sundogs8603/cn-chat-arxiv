Existing studies typically rely on fully supervised machine learning, which presents challenges such as the labor-intensive manual process of annotating extensive training data for each disease and the need to design specialized deep learning architectures for each problem. To address such challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages advanced AI techniques, including large language models and multi-prompt engineering. Specifically, we address two key technical challenges in data-driven chronic disease management: (1) developing personalized prompts to represent each user's uniqueness and (2) incorporating medical knowledge into prompts to provide context for chronic disease detection, instruct learning objectives, and operationalize prediction goals.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究利用最先进的人工智能技术进行慢性病管理，特别是通过用户生成的文本内容来检测各种精神障碍。现有研究通常依赖于全监督机器学习，这带来了一些挑战，比如注释庞大的训练数据对于每种疾病的费时费力的手动过程，以及需要为每个问题设计专门的深度学习架构。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一个新颖的框架，利用了先进的人工智能技术，包括大型语言模型和多Prompt工程。具体而言，我们解决了数据驱动慢性病管理中的两个关键技术挑战：（1）开发个性化的提示来表示每个用户的独特性，以及（2）将医疗知识融入到提示中，为慢性病检测提供上下文，指导学习目标，并实现预测目标。我们使用四种精神障碍来评估我们的方法。",
