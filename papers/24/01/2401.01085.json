    "translated_abstract": "在transformer架构的革命下，自然语言处理（NLP）受到了前所未有的关注。虽然NLP模型的进展已经引起了对其后门漏洞的广泛研究，但这些进展可能引入新的后门威胁还未被探索。本文提出了Imperio，它利用NLP模型的语言理解能力来丰富后门攻击。Imperio提供了一种新的模型控制体验，使对手通过语言引导的指令可以任意控制受害模型的输出。为此，我们使用语言模型来驱动条件触发生成器，并对其进行了优化，以扩展其对后门指令解释和执行的语言理解能力。我们在三个数据集、五种攻击和九种防御的实验中验证了Imperio的有效性。它可以从文本描述中产生上下文适应的触发器，并控制被攻击模型的输出。",
