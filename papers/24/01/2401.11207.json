    "translated_title": "不公平的服务条款：使用定制的BERT的自动化方法",
    "translated_abstract": "服务条款(Terms of Service，ToS)是任何协议的重要组成部分，它定义了服务提供商和最终用户之间的法律关系。它们不仅确定和界定了相互的权利和责任，还为用户提供了与使用数字空间有关的合同重要方面的信息。这些方面包括责任限制、数据保护等各种主题。用户倾向于在使用任何应用程序或服务之前接受ToS而不进行阅读。这种无知可能使他们在需要采取任何行动时处于较弱的状况。现有的检测或分类不公平条款的方法已经过时且表现不佳。在这篇研究论文中，我们以前所未有的Fine-tuning BERT与SVC（支持向量分类器）相结合，提出了关于ToS文档中不公平条款检测的SOTA（最新技术）结果。研究表明了出色的性能。",
