    "translated_abstract": "在当代信息时代，大规模语言模型的出现显著加快了科学文献的传播速度，科学文献的增长达到了前所未有的水平。研究人员迫切需要高效的工具来阅读和总结学术论文，发现重要的科学文献，并运用多种解释方法。为了满足这一迫切需求，自动化科学文献解读系统的作用变得至关重要。然而，现有的商业和开源模型都面临着一些困难：它们往往忽视多模态数据，难以总结过长的文本，并缺乏多样化的用户界面。为了解决这些问题，我们引入了一个开源的多模态自动化学术论文解读系统（MMAPIS），它具有三个步骤的处理阶段，并使用LLMs来增强其功能性。我们的系统首先利用混合模态预处理和对齐模块提取纯文本，",
