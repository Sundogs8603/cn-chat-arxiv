    "abstract": "In this study, we conducted a comprehensive data collection on the 2022 Qatar FIFA World Cup event and used a multilayer network approach to visualize the main topics, while considering their context and meaning relationships. We structured the data into layers that corresponded with the stages of the tournament and utilized Gephi software to generate the multilayer networks. Our visualizations displayed both the relationships between topics and words, showing the word-context relationship, as well as the dynamics and changes over time by layer of the most frequently discussed topics.",
