    "translated_abstract": "如今，对因果发现的需求无处不在。理解系统中部分之间的随机依赖性以及实际的因果关系对科学的各个部分都至关重要。因此，寻找可靠的方法来检测因果方向的需求不断增长。在过去的50年里，出现了许多因果发现算法，但大多数仅适用于系统没有反馈环路并且具有因果充分性的假设，即没有未测量的子系统能够影响多个已测量变量。这是不幸的，因为这些限制在实践中往往不能假定。反馈是许多过程的一个重要特性，现实世界的系统很少是完全隔离和完全测量的。幸运的是，在最近几年中，已经发展了几种能够处理循环的、因果不充分的系统的技术。随着多种方法的出现，一种实际的应用方法开始变得可能。",
