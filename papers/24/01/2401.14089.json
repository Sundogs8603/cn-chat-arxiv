    "translated_abstract": "许多当前的量子机器学习(QML)模型在识别量子数据的重要性方面存在不足，导致处理大规模量子数据集时效果下降。硬注意力机制(HAM)被期望能够有效解决上述QML瓶颈，但面临无法微分的严重挑战，因此限制了其广泛应用性。针对HAM和QML的困境，提出了一种受到Grover启发的量子硬注意力机制(GQHAM)，由柔性预言机(Flexible Oracle, FO)和自适应扩散算子(Adaptive Diffusion Operator, ADO)组成。值得注意的是，FO通过执行具有柔性控制的离散原语(Discrete Primitives, DPs)的激活或屏蔽来克服不可微的问题，从而编织各种离散的命运。在此基础上，这种离散选择可以通过特殊定义的量子硬注意力分数(QHAS)进行可视化。此外，还设计了一个可训练的ADO来增强通用性和灵活性。",
