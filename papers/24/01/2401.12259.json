    "translated_abstract": "当前社会面临着许多挑战，可以通过分布式开放系统来解决。这在智能城市这样的领域尤其如此，包括智能交通、智能能源网络和参与性治理等。在为这些领域设计电脑应用时，需要考虑一个事实，即系统的元素（通常称为软件代理）通常来自不同的设计师，并代表特定的利益相关者。此外，在设计时无法确定这些代理何时加入或离开系统，以及新代理将代表什么利益。在这样的系统中进行协调是非常具有挑战性的，因为通常只能在运行时直接控制其中的一部分。协议技术是指基于协议概念的一组工具和机制，用于开发这种开放的多agent系统。本文认为，协议技术是解决智能城市协调问题的有效途径。",
