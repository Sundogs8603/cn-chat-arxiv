    "translated_abstract": "肽段具有很大的生物医学潜力，是有前景的药物候选物。目前，大部分获批的肽药物直接来自于经过深入研究的自然人类肽段。在广阔而未开发的生物化学空间中，利用先进的深度学习技术识别新型肽药物是非常必要的。尽管已经开发了各种基于计算方法来加速肽段早期药物发现，但现有模型面临过拟合和缺乏普适性的挑战，主要是由于实验数据规模有限，分布不平衡，质量不一致。在本研究中，我们提出了PepGB，一个用于通过预测肽-蛋白相互作用（PepPIs）来促进肽段早期药物发现的深度学习框架。PepGB采用图神经网络，结合了细粒度的扰动模块和基于对比学习的肽段预训练表示的双视图目标来预测PepPIs。通过严格的评估，我们证明了PepGB在预测PepPIs方面的有效性和鲁棒性。",
