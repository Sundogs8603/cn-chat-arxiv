    "translated_abstract": "本文探索了大型语言模型（LLMs）在心理学应用中的前沿。心理学经历了几次理论变革，当前人工智能（AI）和机器学习，特别是LLMs的使用有望开启新的研究方向。我们详细探讨了LLMs如ChatGPT在心理学研究中的转变。文章讨论了LLMs在认知与行为心理学、临床与咨询心理学、教育与发展心理学以及社会与文化心理学等心理学分支中的影响，强调了它们模拟人类认知和行为方面的潜力。本文深入探讨了这些模型模拟人类文本生成的能力，为心理学中的文献回顾、假设生成、实验设计、实验对象、数据分析、学术写作和同行评审等提供创新工具。虽然LLMs在推动研究方法学方面起着重要作用，",
