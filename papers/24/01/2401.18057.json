    "translated_abstract": "最近，各种对比学习技术已经被开发用于时间序列数据的分类，并展现出很好的性能。一种常见的范式是利用适当的数据增强和构建可行的正样本，使得编码器能够在特征空间中将相似的数据点映射得更近，将不相似的数据点映射得更远，从而产生稳健而有区分性的表示。尽管该方法非常有效，在标记样本有限的情况下，正样本的细粒度相对相似性信息（例如排名）往往被忽略。为此，我们提出了一种称为Rank Supervised Contrastive Learning（RankSCL）的方法来进行时间序列分类。与传统的对比学习框架不同，RankSCL在嵌入空间中以一种有针对性的方式进行数据增强，并采用特定的过滤规则来选择更具信息量的正样本和负样本对。此外，还开发了一种新的排名损失函数，来为不同的样本赋予不同的权重。",
