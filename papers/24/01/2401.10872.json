    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个关于无转移的分散双边匹配市场的实验研究。实验参与者了解每个人的偏好，并可以进行任意的非约束性匹配提议，这些提议在市场停滞一段时间后最终确定。我们得出了几个关键结论。首先，稳定的结果很普遍。其次，尽管集中的清算机构通常致力于实现极端稳定的匹配，我们的分散市场最常导致中位稳定匹配。第三，偏好的基数表示影响参与者匹配的稳定伴侣。最后，我们结果的动力学表现出战略上的复杂性，参与者成功地避免了阻止对的循环。",
    "tldr": "这项实验研究了无转移的分散匹配市场，发现稳定的结果很普遍，分散市场更倾向于中位稳定匹配，参与者的偏好也影响着他们匹配的稳定伴侣。实验结果展示了参与者在避免阻止对循环方面的战略智慧。",
    "en_tdlr": "This experimental study of decentralized matching markets without transfers found that stable outcomes are prevalent, with decentralized markets tending to result in median stable matching. Participants' preferences also impact their stable partners, and the results demonstrate strategic sophistication in avoiding cycles of blocking pairs."
