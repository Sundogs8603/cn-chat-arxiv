    "translated_abstract": "刚性蛋白质-蛋白质对接的研究在药物设计和蛋白质工程等各种任务中起着重要作用。最近，已经提出了几种基于学习的方法来进行对接任务，相比计算方法，这些方法表现出更快的对接速度。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为ElliDock的新颖学习方法，该方法通过预测椭抛体来表示蛋白质-蛋白质对接界面。具体来说，我们的模型分别为两个输入蛋白质估计椭抛体接口，并通过使两个接口重合来获得对接的旋转平移变换。通过其设计，ElliDock在蛋白质的任意旋转/平移下都是等变的，这是确保对接过程的泛化性的必要性质。实验评估表明，ElliDock在所有比较方法中拥有最快的推理时间，并且在当前的对接方法中具有强大的竞争力。",
