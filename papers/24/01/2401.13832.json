The risk of manipulation is particularly prominent in the case when AICSs have to deal with information about false claims that underpin propaganda campaigns of authoritarian regimes. Using as a case study of the Russian disinformation campaign concerning the US biolabs in Ukraine, we investigate how one of the most commonly used forms of AICSs - i.e. web search engines - curate misinformation-related content.

    "translated_abstract": "在线内容的增长促使采用算法系统进行信息策划。这些系统包括网络搜索引擎和推荐系统，对帮助用户了解重要社会发展具有重要作用。然而，与新闻编辑不同，算法信息策划系统（AICSs）容易受到各种形式的失效的影响，这使它们容易受到操纵。操纵的风险在于，AICSs必须处理有关虚假主张的信息，这些主张是专制政权的宣传活动的基础。通过以俄罗斯有关乌克兰美国生物实验室的虚假信息宣传运动为案例研究，我们调查了最常用的AICSs形式之一——即网络搜索引擎如何进行谣言相关内容的策划。为此，我们在2020年6月使用虚拟基于代理的算法进行了对Google、Bing和Yandex搜索结果的审核。",
