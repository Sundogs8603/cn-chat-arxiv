    "translated_abstract": "社交网络数据的大量增加为对人类行为进行广泛的数据驱动探索提供了前所未有的机会。社交网络的结构复杂性为各种计算社会科学问题提供了洞察力，特别是社交影响和信息传播方面。然而，对大规模社交网络数据进行建模面临着计算挑战。尽管大型语言模型使得对文本内容进行建模变得更加容易，但任何先进的网络表示方法都难以在可扩展性和高效部署到未知用户的问题上满足要求。为此，我们提出了一种针对用户检测任务中社交网络数据建模的新方法。这种创新方法将本地化社交网络互动与大型语言模型的能力相结合。基于社交网络同质性的前提，即社交连接的用户具有相似性，我们的方法旨在解决这些挑战。",
