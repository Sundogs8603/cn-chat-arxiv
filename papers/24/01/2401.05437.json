    "translated_abstract": "可穿戴设备持续收集传感器数据并用于推断个体的行为，如睡眠、体力活动和情绪。尽管在这个领域有很大的兴趣和进展，但由于数据质量低和数据注释有限，建模真实环境中的多模式传感器数据仍然具有挑战性。本研究探讨了用于填充缺失可穿戴数据的表示学习，并将其与最先进的统计方法进行了比较。我们使用10个生理和行为信号的变化率不同的掩码比率，研究了Transformer模型在缺失数据填充上的性能。结果显示，Transformer模型在变化频繁的信号的缺失数据填充方面优于基准模型，但对于单调信号则不然。我们进一步研究了填充策略和掩码比率对下游分类任务的影响。本研究为基于掩码的自监督学习任务的设计和开发提供了洞察。",
