    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了一种新的用户定位方式，即非专业营销人员可以仅凭需求的自然语言形式选择目标用户。解决这个问题的关键在于如何将自然语言转化为实际的结构化逻辑语言，即对营销人员需求的结构化理解。考虑到大型语言模型（LLMs）出色的自然语言处理能力，我们尝试利用LLMs来解决这个问题。过去的研究表明，通过链式思考（CoT）提示可以有效增强LLMs的推理能力。但是现有方法仍然存在一些限制：（1）先前的方法要么使用简单的“让我们一步一步地思考”提示，要么在演示中提供固定的示例而不考虑提示和问题之间的兼容性，在一些复杂的推理任务（如结构化语言转换）中使LLMs无效。(2) 先前的方法通常在闭源模型或过度实现的模型中实现。",
