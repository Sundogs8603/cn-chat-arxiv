    "translated_abstract": "物联网可以显著提高人类生活的质量，特别是在健康护理方面吸引了广泛的关注。同时，人类数字孪生被提出作为一种创新的范式，可以全面地描述个体人体在数字世界中的复制，并实时反映其物理状况。自然地，人类数字孪生被设想为通过充当多功能、生动的人类数字测试平台来增强物联网健康护理的能力，模拟结果并指导实际治疗。然而，成功建立人类数字孪生需要高保真度的虚拟建模和强大的信息交互，但可能存在稀缺、偏倚和噪声数据。幸运的是，最近流行的一种名为生成式人工智能（GAI）的技术可能是一个有前途的解决方案，因为它可以利用先进的人工智能算法自动生成、操作和修改渐变视图。",
