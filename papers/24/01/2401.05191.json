    "translated_abstract": "负采样对于隐式协同过滤至关重要，能够提供适当的负训练信号以达到良好的性能。我们实验证明，所有现有的负采样方法都只能选择固定难度级别的负样本，从而导致了误判问题和误负问题。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的范式——自适应难度负采样（AHNS），并讨论了它的三个关键准则。通过在训练过程中自适应地选择适当难度的负样本，AHNS可以有效降低误判问题和误负问题的影响。接下来，我们提出了具体的AHNS实例——AHNS_{p<0}，并从理论上证明了AHNS_{p<0}可以很好地符合AHNS的三个准则，并实现了更大的归一化折扣累积增益的下界。此外，我们注意到现有的负采样方法可以被看作是AHNS的更宽松的特例。最后，我们c",
