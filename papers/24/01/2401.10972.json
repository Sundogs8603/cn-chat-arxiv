    "abstract": "In order to efficiently explore the chemical space of all possible small molecules, a common approach is to compress the dimension of the system to facilitate downstream machine learning tasks. Towards this end, we present a data driven approach for clustering potential energy landscapes of molecular structures by applying recently developed Network Embedding techniques, to obtain latent variables defined through the embedding function. To scale up the method, we also incorporate an entropy sensitive adaptive scheme for hierarchical sampling of the energy landscape, based on Metadynamics and Transition Path Theory. By taking into account the kinetic information implied by a system's energy landscape, we are able to interpret dynamical node-node relationships in reduced dimensions. We demonstrate the framework through Lennard-Jones (LJ) clusters and a human DNA sequence.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了有效探索所有可能的小分子的化学空间，一种常见方法是通过压缩系统的维度来促进下游的机器学习任务。为此，我们提出了一种数据驱动的方法，通过应用最近开发的网络嵌入技术，对分子结构的潜在能量景观进行聚类，从而得到通过嵌入函数定义的潜在变量。为了扩展该方法，我们还结合熵敏感的自适应方案，基于元动力学和转变路径理论，对能量景观进行层次采样。通过考虑系统能量景观所隐含的动力学信息，我们能够解释在降维空间中的动态节点之间的关系。我们通过Lennard-Jones (LJ)簇和人类DNA序列来演示这个框架。",
