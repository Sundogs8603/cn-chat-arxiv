    "abstract": "Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) is an essential first step in any modern, high-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) system. Most of the current G2P systems rely on carefully hand-crafted lexicons developed by experts. This poses a two-fold problem. Firstly, the lexicons are generated using a fixed phoneme set, usually, ARPABET or IPA, which might not be the most optimal way to represent phonemes for all languages. Secondly, the man-hours required to produce such an expert lexicon are very high. In this paper, we eliminate both of these issues by using recent advances in self-supervised learning to obtain data-driven phoneme representations instead of fixed representations. We compare our lexicon-free approach against strong baselines that utilize a well-crafted lexicon. Furthermore, we show that our data-driven lexicon-free method performs as good or even marginally better than the conventional rule-based or lexicon-based neural G2Ps in terms of Mean Opinion Score (MOS) while using no prior language",

    "translated_abstract": "字素到音素（G2P）是任何现代高质量文本转语音（TTS）系统中的重要第一步。当前大多数G2P系统依赖于专家编制的精心手工编写的字典。这带来了一个双重问题。首先，字典是使用固定的音素集生成的，通常是ARPABET或IPA，这可能不是最优化地表示所有语言的音素的方式。其次，生产这样一个专家字典所需的工时非常高。本文通过使用自监督学习的最新进展，而不是固定表示法，消除了这两个问题，从而获得了数据驱动的音素表示法。我们将我们的无字典方法与使用精心编写的字典的强基线进行了比较。此外，我们证明了我们的数据驱动无字典方法在平均意见分数（MOS）方面与常规基于规则或基于字典的神经G2P相当或稍微更好，同时不使用任何先验语言知识。",
