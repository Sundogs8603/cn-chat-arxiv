    "translated_abstract": "基于差分隐私增强的联合学习成为了保护客户端数据隐私的常用方法，但现有方案通常假设所有记录的隐私预算均相同，提供一种适用于所有记录的通用解决方案，可能无法满足每个记录的隐私需求。本文探讨了跨领域联合学习中基于记录级个性化差分隐私的未知领域。我们设计了一个名为rPDP-FL的新型框架，采用两阶段混合抽样方案，既包括客户端级别抽样，又包括非均匀记录级别抽样，以适应不同的隐私需求。一个关键且非平凡的问题是在给定个性化隐私预算ε的情况下选择理想的每记录抽样概率q。我们提出了一个多功能解决方案“模拟-曲线拟合”，使我们能够揭示非线性相关性的重要见解。",
