Using the World Risk Index, we conduct a temporal analysis of global disaster risk dynamics from 2011 to 2021. This temporal exploration through the lens of the World Risk Index provides insights into the complex dynamics of disaster risk. We found that, despite sustained efforts, the global landscape remains divided into two main clusters: high susceptibility and moderate susceptibility, regardless of geographical location. This clustering was achieved using a semi-supervised approach through the Label Spreading algorithm, with 98% accuracy.

    "translated_abstract": "评估行动的影响对于管理至关重要。本文评估了全球范围内减轻风险和创建安全环境所考虑的努力的影响。我们通过观察在特定短时间内改善的概率来衡量这种影响。利用世界风险指数，我们对2011年至2021年全球灾害风险动态进行了时间分析。通过世界风险指数的视角进行的这种时间探索揭示了灾害风险的复杂动态。我们发现，尽管进行了持续努力，全球格局仍然分为两个主要集群：高易感性和中等易感性，与地理位置无关。通过半监督方法使用标签扩散算法进行了该聚类，准确率达到了98%。我们还发现，在本研究所考虑的期间（一年、三年和五年），通过监督学习预测的集群持续存在。",
