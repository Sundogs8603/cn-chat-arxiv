    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）在图形学习和挖掘方面展示出强大的能力，而图结构学习（GSL）在提升GNNs的性能方面起着重要作用。在文献中，大多数GSL解决方案要么主要关注具有任务特定监督（如节点分类）的结构精化问题，要么忽视GNNs自身的固有缺陷（如过度挤压），导致尽管采用了精致设计，但性能亚优。鉴于这些限制，我们提出了研究用于有效缓解典型GNNs中的过度挤压问题的自监督图结构-特征协同精化技术。在本文中，我们从黎曼几何中基本不同的角度来考虑黎曼曲率，其中我们遇到了建模、利用和计算黎曼曲率的挑战。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一个自监督黎曼模型，DeepRicci。",
