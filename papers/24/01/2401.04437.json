    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究尝试使用高光谱成像（HSI）来检测产品中的异物，因为它能够可视化包括紫外线和红外线在内的不可见波长。考虑到HSI的巨大图像通道，可以考虑使用多种降维方法（如PCA或UMAP）来减少通道数量，但这些方法无法解决以下基本限制：（1）HSI捕捉的延迟问题；（2）对重要通道的解释能力较弱。为了规避上述方法，本文提出了一种基于异常检测的HSI通道还原方法。与特征提取方法（如PCA或UMAP）不同，特征选择可以按影响排序并具有更好的可解释性，因此我们可以重新设计任务优化和成本效益的光谱相机。通过对合成的MVTec AD数据集进行广泛的实验结果验证，我们确认特征选择方法在推理阶段比特征提取方法快6.90倍。",
