NWP utilizes atmospheric physics for weather modeling but suffers from poor data utilization and high computational costs, while DLP can learn weather patterns from vast amounts of data directly but struggles to incorporate physical laws.

    "translated_abstract": "准确的天气预报对人类活动非常重要。目前，天气预报有两种范式：数值天气预报（NWP）和基于深度学习的预测（DLP）。NWP利用大气物理学进行天气模拟，但数据利用不足和计算成本高的问题使其受到限制，而DLP可以直接从大量数据中学习天气模式，但难以融入物理定律。这两种范式各有优势和劣势，并且不互相兼容，因为NWP中采用的物理定律描述了坐标和气象变量之间的关系，而DLP直接学习气象变量之间的关系而不考虑坐标。为了解决这些问题，我们引入了DeepPhysiNet框架，将物理定律纳入深度学习模型中，以实现准确和连续的天气系统模拟。首先，我们基于多层网络构建物理网络模型。",
