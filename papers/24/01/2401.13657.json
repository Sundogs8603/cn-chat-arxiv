    "translated_abstract": "由于伦理和安全相关的关切，人工智能的广泛应用于医学决策仍然受阻。对于基于人工智能的医疗决策支持系统来说，可靠性和可信度至关重要。然而，常见的深度学习方法在数据转移下往往过于自信。这种在基于证据的场景之外不恰当的推理可能会产生严重后果。这凸显了对本地不确定性可靠估计及其向最终用户传达的重要性。尽管随机神经网络被誉为这些问题的潜在解决方案，但本研究调查了其在临床应用中的实际可靠性。我们以从MIMIC3研究中使用的EHR的ICU住院病死率预测为例来进行分析。对于EHR时间序列的预测，我们采用了仅编码器的Transformer模型。通过纳入常见方法来实现模型函数的随机性。",
