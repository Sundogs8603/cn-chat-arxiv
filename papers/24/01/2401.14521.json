    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了利用机器学习技术开发简洁可解释的集水区尺度水文模型的可行性，采用基于质量守恒感知器（MCP）的有向图结构作为基本计算单元。我们关注的是单个位置的结构复杂性（深度），而不是对大样本集水区具有普适性的广度。目标是发现一个最小的表示（单元状态数和流量路径数），用于表示能够解释给定集水区输入状态和输出行为的主要过程，特别强调模拟全范围（高、中、低）的流量动力学。我们发现，在我们的研究区域，采用类似HyMod的架构，具有3个单元状态和2个主要流动路径，能够实现这样的表示，但引入输入旁路机制可以显著改善水文图的时间和形状。",
    "tldr": "本研究通过利用质量守恒感知器构建基于有向图结构的水文模型，实现了对集水区尺度水文过程的解释能力，在保持简洁性的同时能够准确地模拟各种流量动力学行为，并通过引入输入旁路机制进一步优化了模型的表现。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study develops an interpretable hydrological model using the mass-conserving perceptron and directed-graph architectures, which can accurately simulate various flow dynamics at catchment scale while maintaining simplicity. The model achieves interpretability by representing the dominant processes with minimal cell-states and flow paths, and further improves performance by incorporating an input-bypass mechanism."
