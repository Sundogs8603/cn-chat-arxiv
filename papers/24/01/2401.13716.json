    "translated_abstract": "在医疗领域，确保人工智能工具的安全采用取决于获得足够的训练、测试和验证数据。为了解决隐私问题和监管要求，使用合成数据被提出。合成数据是通过在真实数据上训练生成器来创建具有类似统计属性的数据集。不同分类标准的竞争性指标已被提出，导致了一个复杂的情况。优化质量需要平衡使数据适用于使用的考虑因素，但现有框架中留下了一些相关的维度。我们对在表格医疗数据范围内评估质量指标和使用深度生成方法生成的合成数据进行了全面的文献综述。基于此和团队的集体经验，我们开发了一个概念性的质量保证框架。该框架的适用性与荷兰国家癌症登记中心的实际案例进行了基准测试。",
