    "translated_abstract": "最近，深度学习技术逐渐代替传统统计和机器学习模型成为价格预测任务的首选。本文利用概率深度学习推断波动性指数VIX。我们使用WaveNet、Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)和Transformers的概率对应模型。我们发现，TCN在RMSE约为0.189时胜过其他模型。此外，现代神经网络提供的不准确的不确定性估计问题已被广泛知晓。为解决这个问题，我们使用标准差缩放来校准网络。此外，我们发现，具有高斯先验的MNF模型在精度和不确定性预测方面优于重新参数化技巧和Flipout模型。最后，我们声称具有柯西和对数均匀先验分布的MNF可以最好地推断VIX值，并且能够使TCN和WaveNet网络进行良好的校准。",
