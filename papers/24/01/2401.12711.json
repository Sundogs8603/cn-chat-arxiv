    "abstract": "In traditional machine teaching, a teacher wants to teach a concept to a learner, by means of a finite set of examples, the witness set. But concepts can have many equivalent representations. This redundancy strongly affects the search space, to the extent that teacher and learner may not be able to easily determine the equivalence class of each representation. In this common situation, instead of teaching concepts, we explore the idea of teaching representations. We work with several teaching schemas that exploit representation and witness size (Eager, Greedy and Optimal) and analyze the gains in teaching effectiveness for some representational languages (DNF expressions and Turing-complete P3 programs). Our theoretical and experimental results indicate that there are various types of redundancy, handled better by the Greedy schema introduced here than by the Eager schema, although both can be arbitrarily far away from the Optimal. For P3 programs we found that witness sets are usuall",

    "translated_abstract": "在传统的机器教学中，教师想要通过一个有限的示例集合来向学习者教授一个概念，即证明集。但是概念可以有许多等效的表示方式。这种冗余性强烈影响了搜索空间，以至于教师和学习者可能无法轻易确定每个表示的等价类。在这种常见情况下，我们探索了教授表示的想法。我们使用了几种利用表示和证明集大小的教学模式（Eager、Greedy和Optimal），并分析了对某些表示语言（DNF表达式和图灵完备的P3程序）的教学有效性的提升。我们的理论和实验结果表明，存在各种类型的冗余，通过这里引入的Greedy模式比Eager模式更好地处理，尽管两者都可能远离最优。对于P3程序，我们发现证明集通常是不同的。",
