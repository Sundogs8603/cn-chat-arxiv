    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）彻底改变了设计智能系统的可能方式，将焦点从大规模数据获取和新的建模训练转移到了与人类对齐以及战略性地发挥现有预训练模型的全部潜力上。然而，由于金融情绪分析任务的歧视性特征以及缺乏如何在这种背景下利用生成模型的规定性知识，这种范式转变尚未完全实现。本研究调查了新范式的有效性，即在金融情绪分析中使用无需微调的LLM。基于明斯基的心灵和情绪理论，提出了一种采用异构LLM代理的设计框架。该框架使用先前领域知识实例化专门的代理，并对集合的代理讨论进行推理。在金融情绪分析数据集上进行的全面评估表明，该框架可以获得更高的准确性，特别是在讨论频繁的情况下。",
    "tldr": "本研究提出了一种设计框架，使用动态的异构LLM代理，来改进金融情绪分析的准确性，并在实验中取得了令人满意的结果。",
