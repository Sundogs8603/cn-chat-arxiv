    "abstract": "Background: The semantics of entities extracted from a clinical text can be dramatically altered by modifiers, including entity negation, uncertainty, conditionality, severity, and subject. Existing models for determining modifiers of clinical entities involve regular expression or features weights that are trained independently for each modifier.  Methods: We develop and evaluate a multi-task transformer architecture design where modifiers are learned and predicted jointly using the publicly available SemEval 2015 Task 14 corpus and a new Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) data set that contains modifiers shared with SemEval as well as novel modifiers specific for OUD. We evaluate the effectiveness of our multi-task learning approach versus previously published systems and assess the feasibility of transfer learning for clinical entity modifiers when only a portion of clinical modifiers are shared.  Results: Our approach achieved state-of-the-art results on the ShARe corpus from SemEval 2015 T",

    "translated_abstract": "背景：从临床文本中提取的实体的语义可能会受到修饰语的显著改变，包括实体的否定、不确定性、条件性、严重性和主观性。现有的确定临床实体修饰语的模型涉及使用正则表达式或特征权重，这些权重是独立训练每个修饰语的。方法：我们开发并评估了一个多任务变换器架构设计，在公开可用的SemEval 2015任务14语料库和一个新的阿片类物质使用障碍（OUD）数据集上共同学习和预测修饰语，该数据集包含与SemEval共享的修饰语以及OUD特定的新修饰语。我们评估了我们的多任务学习方法与以前发表的系统的效果，并评估了仅共享部分临床修饰语时的临床实体修饰语的迁移学习的可行性。结果：我们的方法在来自SemEval 2015的ShARe语料库上取得了最新技术的结果。",
