It can be problematic when dealing with experimental data characterized by measurement uncertainties and errors. Our paper proposes a recursive scheme for clustering data obtained in geographical (climatological) experiments. The discussion of results obtained by k-means and SOM methods with the developed recursive procedure is presented. We show that the clustering using the new approach gives more acceptable results when compared to experts assessments.",
