We show that certain EQNN models can preserve equivariance under Pauli channels, while this is not possible under the amplitude damping channel. We claim that the symmetry breaking grows linearly in the number of layers and noise strength. We support our claims with numerical data from simulations as well as hardware up to 64 qubits.

    "translated_abstract": "基于等变量量子神经网络（EQNN）的几何量子机器学习最近成为量子机器学习中的一个有前景的方向。尽管取得了令人鼓舞的进展，但目前的研究仍限于理论，并且尚未探索EQNN训练中硬件噪声的作用。本工作研究了EQNN模型在噪声存在的情况下的行为。我们展示了特定的EQNN模型可以在Pauli通道下保持等变性，而在阻尼通道下不可能实现。我们声称对称性破缺随着层数和噪声强度呈线性增长。我们通过数值模拟和高达64个量子比特的硬件实验数据支持我们的论断。此外，我们提供了在噪声存在的情况下增强EQNN模型对称性保护的策略。",
