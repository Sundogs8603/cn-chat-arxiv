    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了应用于非可微函数（NGDMs）和应用于可微函数的传统梯度下降（GDs）之间的区别。首先，我们证明了NGDMs的收敛性质与GDs存在显著差异，挑战了基于$L$-光滑性的广泛神经网络收敛文献对非光滑神经网络的适用性。接下来，我们展示了NGDM解决$L_1$正则化问题的矛盾性质，表明增加正则化惩罚会导致NGDMs中最优解的$L_1$范数增加。因此，我们证明了广泛采用的基于$L_1$惩罚的网络修剪技术并未产生预期结果。最后，我们探索了稳定边界现象（Edge of Stability），指出即使对于Lipschitz连续凸可微函数，它也不适用于非凸非可微的神经网络。",
