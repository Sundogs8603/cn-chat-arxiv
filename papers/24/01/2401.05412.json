    "translated_abstract": "利用可穿戴设备进行运动重建已成为一种经济且可行的技术。某些方法利用人体上的稀疏惯性测量单元(IMUs)并采用数据驱动的策略来建模人体姿势。然而，仅基于稀疏的IMUs数据进行运动重建在本质上存在模糊性，这是由于大量相同的IMU读数对应于不同的姿势。在本文中，我们探讨了多传感器的空间重要性，受到描述特定动作的文本的监督。具体地，我们引入了不确定性来为每个IMU派生加权特征。我们还设计了一个分层时序变换器(HTT)，并应用对比学习来实现传感器数据与文本语义的精确时序和特征对齐。实验结果表明，与现有方法相比，我们提出的方法在多个指标上取得了显著的改进。值得注意的是，通过文本监督，我们的方法可以实现准确的运动重建。",
