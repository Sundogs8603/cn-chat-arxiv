    "translated_abstract": "在人工智能领域，赋予机器抽象推理能力是一个长期的研究课题。Raven的渐进矩阵（RPM）被广泛用于探索机器智能中的抽象视觉推理，模型需要理解潜在的规则并从候选集中选择缺失的右下图像来完成图像矩阵。参与者可以通过推断潜在的属性变化规则和想象任意位置的缺失图像展示强大的推理能力。然而，现有的解决方案很难在现实的RPM问题中展示出这种能力。在本文中，我们提出了一个条件生成模型，通过规则抽象和选择（RAISE）在潜在空间中解决答案生成问题。RAISE将图像属性编码为潜在概念，并通过概念将潜在规则分解成原子规则，这些原子规则被抽象为全局可学习的参数。在生成答案时，RAISE选择...",
