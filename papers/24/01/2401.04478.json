    "abstract": "The success of drug discovery and development relies on the precise prediction of molecular activities and properties. While in silico molecular property prediction has shown remarkable potential, its use has been limited so far to assays for which large amounts of data are available. In this study, we use a fine-tuned large language model to integrate biological assays based on their textual information, coupled with Barlow Twins, a Siamese neural network using a novel self-supervised learning approach. This architecture uses both assay information and molecular fingerprints to extract the true molecular information. TwinBooster enables the prediction of properties of unseen bioassays and molecules by providing state-of-the-art zero-shot learning tasks. Remarkably, our artificial intelligence pipeline shows excellent performance on the FS-Mol benchmark. This breakthrough demonstrates the application of deep learning to critical property prediction tasks where data is typically scarce.",

    "translated_abstract": "药物发现和开发的成功依赖于对分子活性和属性的精确预测。虽然基于计算的分子属性预测显示出了显著的潜力，但其使用迄今为止仅限于大量数据可用的检测方法。在本研究中，我们使用经过微调的大语言模型，结合了基于文本信息的生物检测方法，并使用了一种新颖的自监督学习方法的Siamese神经网络Barlow Twins。该架构利用检测方法信息和分子指纹提取真实的分子信息。TwinBooster通过提供最先进的零样本学习任务，实现了对未见过的生物检测方法和分子的属性预测。值得注意的是，我们的人工智能流水线在FS-Mol基准测试上表现出优秀的性能。这一突破展示了深度学习在通常数据稀缺的关键属性预测任务中的应用。",
