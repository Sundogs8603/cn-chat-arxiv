    "translated_abstract": "在现实世界中，时间序列预测是至关重要且具有挑战性的。近期对于时间序列基础模型的兴趣激增，这些模型适应各种不同的下游任务，这是值得注意的。然而，现有方法往往忽视了时间序列的多尺度性质，这是进行精确预测所必需的。为了弥合这一差距，我们提出了HiMTM，一种专门针对长期预测设计的分层多尺度屏蔽时间序列建模方法。具体包括四个主要组成部分：（1）分层多尺度变压器（HMT）捕捉不同尺度的时间信息；（2）解耦的编码器-解码器（DED）让编码器专注于特征提取，而解码器专注于假设任务；（3）多尺度屏蔽重构（MMR）为预训练提供多阶段的监督信号；（4）跨尺度注意微调（CSA-FT）以捕捉不同尺度之间的依赖性进行预测。综上所述，这些部件共同构成了模型。",
