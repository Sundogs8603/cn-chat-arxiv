    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种通用的基于模型的重新排序框架——多插槽重新排序器，它同时优化相关性、多样性和新鲜度。具体而言，我们的顺序贪心算法（SGA）足够高效（线性时间复杂度）用于大规模生产推荐引擎。它在离线AUC（接收器操作特征曲线下面积）上取得了6%至10%的提升，主要是由于在列表中明确建模了物品之间的相互影响，并利用了多个目标的第二次排序得分。此外，我们将离线回放理论推广到多插槽重新排序场景，通过在多个目标之间进行权衡来改善离线回放结果。离线回放结果还可以通过Pareto最优性进一步改进。此外，我们还基于OpenAI Gym和Ray框架构建了一个多插槽重新排序模拟器。它可以根据不同的假设进行简单配置，快速评估强化学习和...",
