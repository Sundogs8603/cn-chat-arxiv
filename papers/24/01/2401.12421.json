    "translated_abstract": "半监督领域自适应（SSDA）在计算机视觉中是一个关键的难题，特别是在现实世界的环境中标记数据常常稀缺的情况下。这种稀缺常导致在新领域应用基础模型时效果不佳。我们提出的AdaEmbed是半监督领域自适应的一种新方法，为这些挑战提供了一个有希望的解决方案。AdaEmbed利用无标签数据的潜力，通过学习共享的嵌入空间，促进从有标签源领域到无标签目标领域的知识转移。通过根据建立的嵌入空间生成准确且统一的伪标签，该模型克服了传统SSDA的局限，从而显著提高了性能。我们通过对DomainNet、Office-Home和VisDA-C等基准数据集进行了大量实验，验证了我们方法的有效性，AdaEmbed在所有基线上均取得了更好的性能，创造了领域中的新纪录。",
