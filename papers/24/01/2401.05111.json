    "abstract": "The zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) method, based on speaker embeddings extracted from reference speech using self-supervised learning (SSL) speech representations, can reproduce speaker characteristics very accurately. However, this approach suffers from degradation in speech synthesis quality when the reference speech contains noise. In this paper, we propose a noise-robust zero-shot TTS method. We incorporated adapters into the SSL model, which we fine-tuned with the TTS model using noisy reference speech. In addition, to further improve performance, we adopted a speech enhancement (SE) front-end. With these improvements, our proposed SSL-based zero-shot TTS achieved high-quality speech synthesis with noisy reference speech. Through the objective and subjective evaluations, we confirmed that the proposed method is highly robust to noise in reference speech, and effectively works in combination with SE.",

    "translated_abstract": "基于自监督学习（SSL）语音表征提取的说话人嵌入向量的零样本文本到语音（TTS）方法可以非常准确地复制说话人的特征。然而，当参考语音中含有噪声时，该方法的语音合成质量会下降。本文提出了一种抗噪零样本TTS方法。我们将适配器引入到SSL模型中，并使用带有噪声参考语音的TTS模型进行微调。此外，为了进一步提高性能，我们采用了语音增强（SE）前端。通过这些改进，我们提出的基于SSL的零样本TTS在噪声参考语音下实现了高质量的语音合成。通过客观和主观评估，我们确认了该方法对参考语音中的噪声具有高度的鲁棒性，并且与SE结合有效地运作。",
