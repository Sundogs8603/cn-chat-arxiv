    "translated_abstract": "本论文引入了一种名为“友好攻击”的新方法，旨在提高纠错信道编码的性能。受到对抗性攻击概念的启发，我们的方法利用对神经网络输入进行轻微扰动的想法，对网络性能产生了重大影响。通过在传输前向固定点调制的码字引入小的扰动，我们有效地提高了解码器的性能，而不违反输入功率约束。扰动设计由修改过的迭代快速梯度方法完成。本研究考察了适用于计算梯度以获得所需扰动的各种解码器架构。具体而言，我们考虑了在LDPC码中的置信传播（BP），在极化码中的误差纠正码变换器、BP和神经BP（NBP），以及在卷积码中的神经BCJR。我们证明了所提出的友好攻击方法可以提高可靠性。",
