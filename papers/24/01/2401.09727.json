    "abstract": "The critical threat of phishing emails has been further exacerbated by the potential of LLMs to generate highly targeted, personalized, and automated spear phishing attacks. Two critical problems concerning LLM-facilitated phishing require further investigation: 1) Existing studies on lateral phishing lack specific examination of LLM integration for large-scale attacks targeting the entire organization, and 2) Current anti-phishing infrastructure, despite its extensive development, lacks the capability to prevent LLM-generated attacks, potentially impacting both employees and IT security incident management. However, the execution of such investigative studies necessitates a real-world environment, one that functions during regular business operations and mirrors the complexity of a large organizational infrastructure. This setting must also offer the flexibility required to facilitate a diverse array of experimental conditions, particularly the incorporation of phishing emails crafted",

    "translated_abstract": "钓鱼电子邮件的严重威胁被LLMs生成高度定向、个性化和自动化的鱼叉式网络钓鱼攻击的潜力进一步恶化。关于LLM促成的钓鱼存在两个关键问题需要进一步调查：1）现有的横向网络钓鱼研究缺乏针对整个组织进行大规模攻击的LLM整合的具体审查；2）尽管反钓鱼基础设施经过广泛开发，但仍无法防止LLM生成的攻击，可能影响员工和IT安全事件管理。然而，进行这样的调查研究需要在现实世界环境中进行，该环境在正常业务运作期间工作，并反映出大型组织基础设施的复杂性。此设置还必须提供所需的灵活性，以促进各种实验条件的实施，特别是钓鱼电子邮件的制作和组织范围的攻击。",
