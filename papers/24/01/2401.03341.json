    "abstract": "Due to their unsupervised training and uncertainty estimation, deep Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have become powerful tools for reconstruction-based Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD). Existing VAE-based TSAD methods, either statistical or deep, tune meta-priors to estimate the likelihood probability for effectively capturing spatiotemporal dependencies in the data. However, these methods confront the challenge of inherent data scarcity, which is often the case in anomaly detection tasks. Such scarcity easily leads to latent holes, discontinuous regions in latent space, resulting in non-robust reconstructions on these discontinuous spaces.

    "translated_abstract": "由于其无监督训练和不确定性估计，深度变分自编码器（VAEs）已经成为基于重建的时间序列异常检测（TSAD）的强大工具。现有的基于VAE的TSAD方法，不论是统计方法还是深度方法，都调整元先验以估计有效捕获数据中的时空依赖关系的似然概率。然而，这些方法面临着内在数据稀缺的挑战，这在异常检测任务中经常出现。这种稀缺容易导致潜在空间中的潜在空洞，即潜在空间中的不连续区域，导致在这些不连续的空间上的非鲁棒重构。我们提出了一种将VAEs与自监督学习（SSL）结合的新颖生成框架来解决这个问题。",
