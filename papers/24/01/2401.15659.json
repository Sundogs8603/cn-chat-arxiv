    "abstract": "This paper studies an optimal investment-consumption problem for competitive agents with exponential or power utilities and a common finite time horizon. Each agent regards the average of habit formation and wealth from all peers as benchmarks to evaluate the performance of her decision. We formulate the n-agent game problems and the corresponding mean field game problems under the two utilities. One mean field equilibrium is derived in a closed form in each problem. In each problem with n agents, an approximate Nash equilibrium is then constructed using the obtained mean field equilibrium when n is sufficiently large. The explicit convergence order in each problem can also be obtained. In addition, we provide some numerical illustrations of our results.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一个在有限时间内，竞争代理人使用指数或幂函数效用的优化投资-消费问题。每个代理人将来自所有同行的习惯形成和财富的平均值作为评估她决策表现的基准。我们分别基于这两种效用形式得到了n个代理人博弈问题和相应的均值场博弈问题的形式。在每个问题中，通过这些均值场均衡可以得到一个闭式解，当n足够大的时候，我们还构建了一个近似纳什均衡。此外，我们还进行了一些数值实例分析来验证我们的结果。",
