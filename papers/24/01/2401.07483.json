To perform this experiment the data were collected from multiple sources including stock price and financial news. Python is used as an interface to connect and query databases (to create database structures according to the feed file structure, to load data into tables, objects, to read data , to connect PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, Neo4j. Purpose Modern applications of LLM (Large language model) including RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with Machine Learning, deep learning, NLP (natural language processing) or Decision Analytics are computationally expensive. Finding a better option to consume less resources and time to get the result. Findings The Graph database of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) is comparatively better and can be considered for extended analytics to integrate ESG in business and investment.
