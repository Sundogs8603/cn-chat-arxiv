    "translated_abstract": "多模态概率预测模型的发展引发了对综合评估指标的需求。虽然有几个指标可以表征机器学习模型的准确性（例如，负对数似然、Jensen-Shannon散度），但这些指标通常作用于概率密度上。因此，将它们应用于纯粹基于样本的预测模型需要估计底层密度函数。然而，常见的方法如核密度估计（KDE）已被证明在鲁棒性方面存在不足，而更复杂的方法在多模态估计问题中尚未得到评估。在本文中，我们提出了一种非参数的密度估计方法ROME（RObust Multi-modal density Estimator），它解决了估计多模态、非正态和高相关分布的挑战。ROME利用聚类将多模态样本集分割成多个单模态样本集，然后结合简单的KDE估计来得到总体的估计结果。",
