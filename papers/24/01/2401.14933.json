    "translated_abstract": "背景：单体设计在教育和生物医学等多个领域中被使用。然而，目前还没有适合的正式词汇来注释此类研究的详细配置和结果，以获得有关它们的信息。因此，对这些研究设计的搜索很大程度上依赖于对摘要、关键词或全文进行语法搜索，这存在一些限制。目标：介绍SSDOnt，一个用于描述和注释单体设计研究的特定目的本体论，以便随后可以对其进行复杂问题的提问。方法：本体论是按照NeOn方法论开发的。在定义了本体论的要求后，使用描述逻辑描述了一个形式化模型，并在本体论语言OWL 2 DL中实现了该模型。结果：我们展示了本体论如何提供一个具有适当术语的参考模型，用于表示单体设计研究的详细配置和结果。",
