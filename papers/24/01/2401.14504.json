    "translated_abstract": "收集交通数据对于交通系统和城市规划至关重要，并且通常更希望通过易于部署但电力受限的设备进行，这是由于电力和网络基础设施的不可用性或高成本所致。有限的电力意味着数据收集持续时间和准确性/分辨率之间不可避免的权衡。我们介绍了一种新颖的基于学习的框架，通过策略性地决定电池供电设备的观测时间，并从稀疏采样的观测中重建完整的数据流，从而实现最小的性能损失和显著延长系统寿命。我们的框架由预测器、控制器和估计器组成。预测器利用历史数据来预测固定时间范围内的未来趋势。控制器使用这些预测来确定下一个最优的数据收集时间。最后，估计器从采样观测中重建完整的数据配置文件。我们评估了该系统的性能。",
