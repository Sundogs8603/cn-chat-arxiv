    "translated_abstract": "顺序推荐的多兴趣学习方法旨在根据用户的多方面兴趣预测下一个项目，给定用户的历史互动。现有方法主要由两个模块组成：多兴趣提取模块学习用户的多兴趣嵌入以捕捉用户多兴趣，多兴趣权重预测模块学习每个兴趣的权重，以聚合学习到的多兴趣嵌入以得到用户嵌入，用于预测用户对项目的评分。尽管这些方法很有效，但存在两个主要限制：1)它们直接将用户互动输入两个模块中，而忽略了它们不同的学习目标；2)它们仅考虑用户互动的中心性来学习用户的多兴趣，忽视了它们的离散性。为了解决这些限制，我们提出了一种基于提示的多兴趣学习方法（PoMRec），其中具体的提示被用来指导多兴趣嵌入模块和多兴趣权重预测模块的学习。",
