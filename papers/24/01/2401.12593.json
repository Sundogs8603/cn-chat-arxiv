    "abstract": "Multi-Objective Recommender Systems (MORSs) emerged as a paradigm to guarantee multiple (often conflicting) goals. Besides accuracy, a MORS can operate at the global level, where additional beyond-accuracy goals are met for the system as a whole, or at the individual level, meaning that the recommendations are tailored to the needs of each user. The state-of-the-art MORSs either operate at the global or individual level, without assuming the co-existence of the two perspectives. In this study, we show that when global and individual objectives co-exist, MORSs are not able to meet both types of goals. To overcome this issue, we present an approach that regulates the recommendation lists so as to guarantee both global and individual perspectives, while preserving its effectiveness. Specifically, as individual perspective, we tackle genre calibration and, as global perspective, provider fairness. We validate our approach on two real-world datasets, publicly released with this paper.",

    "translated_abstract": "多目标推荐系统（MORS）作为一种保证多个目标的范式出现。除了准确性外，MORS可以在全局层面上工作，为整个系统实现除准确性之外的其他目标，也可以在个体层面上工作，这意味着推荐是根据每个用户的需求定制的。现有的MORS要么在全局层面上工作，要么在个体层面上工作，而不假设这两种观点的共存。在本研究中，我们表明当全局和个体目标共存时，MORS无法同时满足这两种目标。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种方法，通过调节推荐列表来保证全局和个体的观点，同时保持其有效性。具体而言，作为个体角度，我们解决了流派校准问题，作为全局角度，我们解决了供应商公平性问题。我们在两个实际数据集上验证了我们的方法，这些数据集与本文一同公开发布。",
