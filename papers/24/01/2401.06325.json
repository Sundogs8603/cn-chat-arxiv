    "translated_abstract": "为了从一般的目标分布$p_*\\propto e^{-f_*}$中进行采样，超越等温条件，Huang等人（2023）提出了通过反向扩散进行采样，从而产生了基于扩散的蒙特卡罗（DMC）方法。具体而言，DMC遵循扩散过程的反向SDE，将目标分布转化为标准高斯分布，并利用非参数评分估计。然而，原始的DMC算法遇到了高梯度复杂性的问题，导致对获得的样本的误差容差$\\epsilon$的依赖成指数增长。在本文中，我们证明了DMC的高复杂性源于其冗余的评分估计设计，并提出了一种更高效的算法，称为RS-DMC，基于一种新颖的递归评分估计方法。特别地，我们首先将整个扩散过程划分为多个段落，然后将评分估计步骤（在任何时间步骤）形式化为一系列相互连接的均值估计步骤。",
