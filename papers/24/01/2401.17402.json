    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了在半导体制造企业中管理产品转型的问题，该企业需要通过多层次后继模型协调多个自治产品部门的资源分配决策，以捕捉决策过程的分层和分散特性。作为领导者的企业管理层旨在有限时间内最大化企业的总利润。后继者由多个产品部门组成，它们必须共享制造和工程资源来开发、生产和销售市场上的产品。每个产品部门都需要工程能力来开发新产品，并需要工厂能力来生产销售产品，同时还要生产产品开发流程所需的样品和样本。我们将产品部门之间的相互依赖关系建模为一个广义纳什均衡问题，并提出了一种重新定义的模型，其中企业管理层作为领导者来协调资源分配。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study uses a multi-follower bilevel programming model to coordinate resource allocation decisions during product transitions. The corporate management acts as the leader and aims to maximize the total profit of the firm by coordinating the sharing of manufacturing and engineering resources among multiple autonomous product divisions for product development, production, and sales. The research emphasizes the importance of resource allocation decisions in product transitions and provides an effective model for decision coordination."
