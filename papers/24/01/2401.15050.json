Numerous downstream tasks and datasets have been introduced to facilitate the training of AI models capable of parsing and extracting information from various document types such as receipts and scanned forms. Despite these advancements, both existing datasets and models fail to address critical challenges that arise in industrial contexts. Existing datasets primarily comprise short documents consisting of a single page, while existing models are constrained by a limited maximum length, often set at 512 tokens. Consequently, the practical application of these methods in financial services, where documents can span multiple pages, is severely impeded.

    "translated_abstract": "文档AI是一个不断发展的研究领域，其专注于理解和从扫描和数字文档中提取信息，以使日常业务操作更加高效。虽然已经引入了许多下游任务和数据集来促进训练能够解析和提取各种文档类型（如收据和扫描表单）信息的AI模型，但是现有的数据集和模型都无法解决工业环境中出现的关键挑战。现有数据集主要由单页组成的短文档构成，而现有模型受限于最大长度的限制，通常限制在512个标记。因此，在金融服务中实际应用这些方法会受到严重限制，因为文档可能跨越多个页面。为了解决这些挑战，我们引入了LongFin，一种能够编码多达4K个标记的多模态文档AI模型。同时，我们还提出了LongForms",
