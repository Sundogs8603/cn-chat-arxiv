    "abstract": "In densely populated urban areas, where interactions between pedestrians, vehicles, and motorcycles are frequent and complex, traffic safety is a critical concern. This paper evaluates the Neighborhood Traffic Environment Improvement Program in Taipei, which involved painting green pedestrian paths, adjusting no-parking red/yellow lines, and painting speed limit and stop/slow signs on lanes and alleys. Exploiting staggered rollout of policy implementation and administrative traffic accident data, we found that the program reduced daytime traffic accidents by 5 percent and injuries by 8 percent, while having no significant impact on nighttime incidents. The effectiveness of the program during the day is mainly attributed to the painted green sidewalks, with adequate sunlight playing a part in the program's success. Our findings indicate that cost-effective strategies like green pedestrian lanes can be effective in areas with dense populations and high motorcycle traffic, as they improve",

    "translated_abstract": "在人口稠密的城市地区，行人、车辆和摩托车之间的互动频繁且复杂，交通安全是一个关键问题。本文评估了台北的社区交通环境改善计划，该计划包括绘制绿色人行道、调整禁止停车的红/黄线以及在车道和小巷上绘制限速和停止/慢行标志。利用政策实施的阶段性推出和行政交通事故数据，我们发现该计划将白天交通事故减少了5%，受伤人数减少了8%，而对夜间事故没有显著影响。白天计划的有效性主要归功于绘制的绿色人行道，充足的阳光也对计划的成功起到一定作用。我们的研究结果表明，像绿色人行道这样的成本效益高的策略在人口稠密和摩托车流量大的地区是有效的。",
