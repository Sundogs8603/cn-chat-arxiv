    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理、信息检索(IR)、计算机视觉等技术的快速发展，对评估这些系统的性能提出了显著挑战。其中一个主要挑战是人工标记数据的稀缺性，这限制了对这些系统的公平和准确评估。在本研究中，我们特别关注使用稀疏标签评估IR系统，借鉴了最近在评估计算机视觉任务方面的研究成果。受将Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID)用于评估文本到图像生成系统成功的启发，我们提出利用Fr\\'echet距离来衡量相关被判定项和检索结果的分布之间的距离。我们在MS MARCO V1数据集和TREC深度学习轨迹查询集上的实验结果证明了Fr\\'echet距离作为评估IR系统的指标的有效性，特别是在少量标签可用的情况下。",
