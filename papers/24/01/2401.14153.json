    "translated_abstract": "本文开发了一个基于代理的模拟来评估基于代理的AmI场景。许多AmI应用程序都是通过代理来实现的，但没有将它们与其他现有的替代方法进行比较，以评估使用它们相对于其他方法的效益。提出的模拟环境使用两个评估指标来分析这些效益：首先，通过测量不同类型愿望的代理满意度来衡量。其次，通过正确使用上下文信息所获得的时间节约来衡量。因此，本文使用NetLogo模拟环境评估了之前提出的在机场提供AmI服务的代理架构、本体论和12步协议。本文使用NetLogo模型考虑了该应用领域的可扩展性问题，同时使用FIPA和BDI扩展与我们先前的工作和我们先前的JADE实现保持一致。",
