    "translated_abstract": "集成电路（IC）供应链的全球化使得IC易受到硬件木马（HT）的威胁。面对这种威胁，一种有希望的方法是使用基于机器学习（ML）的侧信道分析，这种方法具有非入侵性的优势，并能在黄金芯片无干扰的情况下高效地检测HT。本文质疑基于机器学习的侧信道分析来检测HT的可靠性。我们引入了一种HT混淆（HTO）方法，以允许HT绕过这种检测方法。我们的方法的一个关键方面是在电路的一部分和HT一起设计和实现对抗性噪声，而不是通过模拟对抗性迹线来理论上误导模型。我们详细介绍了ASIC和FPGA的HTO方法，并使用TrustHub基准进行评估。有趣的是，我们发现HTO可以在ASIC设计中只使用一个晶体管来实现。",
