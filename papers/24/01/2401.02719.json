    "abstract": "This paper focuses on addressing the issue of image demoireing. Unlike the large volume of existing studies that rely on learning from paired real data, we attempt to learn a demoireing model from unpaired real data, i.e., moire images associated with irrelevant clean images. The proposed method, referred to as Unpaired Demoireing (UnDeM), synthesizes pseudo moire images from unpaired datasets, generating pairs with clean images for training demoireing models. To achieve this, we divide real moire images into patches and group them in compliance with their moire complexity. We introduce a novel moire generation framework to synthesize moire images with diverse moire features, resembling real moire patches, and details akin to real moire-free images. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive denoise method to eliminate the low-quality pseudo moire images that adversely impact the learning of demoireing models. We conduct extensive experiments on the commonly-used FHDMi and UHDM datasets. R",

    "translated_abstract": "本文专注于解决图像去莫尔问题。与现有大量研究依赖于成对真实数据学习的情况不同，我们尝试从不成对的真实数据中学习莫尔问题模型，即关联到不相关清晰图像的莫尔图像。提出的方法称为无对齐去莫尔（Unpaired Demoireing，UnDeM），从不成对数据集中合成伪莫尔图像，为训练去莫尔模型生成与清晰图像对应的图像对。为了实现这一目标，我们将真实莫尔图像分成小块并按照莫尔复杂程度进行分组。我们引入了一种新的莫尔生成框架，以合成具有多样化莫尔特征的莫尔图像，类似于真实的莫尔块，并具有类似真实无莫尔图像的细节。此外，我们引入了自适应去噪方法，以消除低质量的伪莫尔图像对去莫尔模型的学习产生的不利影响。我们在常用的FHDMi和UHDM数据集上进行了广泛的实验。",
