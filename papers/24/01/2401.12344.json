    "translated_abstract": "尽管AI的革命性影响和本地训练算法的发展，但在医学AI中从多模态数据实现广义学习仍然是一个重大挑战。这个差距限制了可扩展医学AI解决方案的实际部署。为了解决这个挑战，我们的研究提出了一种自监督的鲁棒机器学习框架OCT-SelfNet，用于使用光学相干断层扫描（OCT）图像检测眼科疾病。在这项工作中，综合了来自不同机构的各种数据集，实现了更全面的表征范围。我们的方法通过使用基于SwinV2骨架的自监督预训练和监督微调的双阶段训练方法，提供了一个适用于临床实际部署的解决方案。在三个数据集上进行了大量实验证明了不同编码器骨架、低数据设置、未见数据设置和数据增强的影响。",
