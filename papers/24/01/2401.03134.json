    "translated_abstract": "许多现实世界的系统展示了时间上的动态行为，这些行为可以被捕捉为复杂代理交互的时间序列。为了进行时间推理，目前的方法主要通过简单的序列模型来编码时间动态。然而，一般来说，这些模型在有效捕捉输入中丰富动态的全谱时往往失败，因为动态并不均匀分布。特别是，有关信息可能更难提取，并且即使它们不包含重大变化或新信息，也会浪费计算能力来处理所有单独的时间步长。在这里，我们提出了TimeGraphs，一种将动态交互作为分层时间图来表征的新方法，与传统的顺序表示不同。我们的方法使用紧凑的基于图的表示来建模交互，实现了对不同时间尺度的自适应推理。采用自监督方法，TimeGraphs构建了一个多层级事件层次结构",
