    "translated_abstract": "仇恨言论代表着一种普遍且有害的在线言论形式，通常表现为一系列不友好的言语，从令人讨厌的推文到诽谤性的帖子。随着这种言论的蔓延，它连接了全球的人们，并对被针对的个人和社区构成了重大的社会、心理和偶尔的身体威胁。目前，针对这一现象的计算语言学方法依赖于带有标签的社交媒体数据集进行训练。为了统一努力，我们的研究在解决这一问题的关键需求上取得了进展，倡导使用一个全面的元收集数据集，有助于有效对抗这个问题。我们审查了60多个数据集，并选择性地将与之相关的数据纳入MetaHate中。本文对现有收集进行了详细研究，强调了它们的优点和局限性。我们的研究结果有助于更深入地了解现有数据集，为训练更强大和适应性更强的模型铺平了道路。",
