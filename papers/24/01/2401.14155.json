    "translated_abstract": "图形异常检测是一个具有挑战性的二分类问题，由于异常节点和正常节点之间的结构分布不同，使得该问题变得困难。异常节点是少数，因此与正常节点相比，具有较高的异质性和较低的同质性。此外，由于各种时间因素和人类专家的注释偏好，异质性和同质性在训练和测试数据之间可能会发生变化，这在本文中被称为结构分布偏移（SDS）。主流方法是基于图神经网络（GNN）构建的，通过聚合同质邻居有利于正常节点的分类，但忽视了异常节点的SDS问题，导致泛化能力差。本研究从特征视角解决了这个问题。我们观察到SDS的程度在异常节点和正常节点之间有所不同。因此，解决这个问题的关键在于对异常节点抵抗高异质性的同时，从同质邻居中受益于正常节点的学习。",
