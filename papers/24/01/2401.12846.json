    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）可能在未来的AI辅助业务流程管理系统（ABPMSs）中发挥重要作用，其功能涵盖系统生命周期的各个阶段。其中一个系统功能是情境感知解释（SAX），它涉及生成在考虑所解释条件出现的流程上下文的前提下既符合因果关系又可人类解读的解释。在本文中，我们介绍了开发用于生成SAX解释的SAX4BPM框架。SAX4BPM套件包括一组服务和一个中央知识库。这些服务的功能是获取构成SAX解释的各种知识要素。其中一个创新性的关键组成部分是因果过程执行视图。在本工作中，我们将该框架与LLM集成，以利用其综合各种输入要素的能力，从而改进SAX解释的质量。",
