    "abstract": "Climate change poses increasingly complex challenges to our society. Extreme weather events such as floods, wild fires or droughts are becoming more frequent, spontaneous and difficult to foresee or counteract. In this work we specifically address the problem of sewage water polluting surface water bodies after spilling over from rain tanks as a consequence of heavy rain events. We investigate to what extent state-of-the-art interpretable time series models can help predict such critical water level points, so that the excess can promptly be redistributed across the sewage network. Our results indicate that modern time series models can contribute to better waste water management and prevention of environmental pollution from sewer systems. All the code and experiments can be found in our repository: https://github.com/TeodorChiaburu/RIWWER_TimeSeries.",

    "translated_abstract": "气候变化对我们的社会提出了越来越复杂的挑战。洪水、野火或干旱等极端天气事件变得越来越频繁、突发且难以预见或应对。在这项工作中，我们特别解决了重雨事件导致下雨罐溢出以后，污水污染地表水体的问题。我们调查了最先进的可解释时间序列模型在如何预测这些临界水位点方面的作用，以便能够及时将多余的水重新分配到下水道网络中。我们的结果表明，现代时间序列模型可以为改善废水管理和预防下水道系统对环境的污染做出贡献。所有的代码和实验可以在我们的存储库中找到：https://github.com/TeodorChiaburu/RIWWER_TimeSeries。",
