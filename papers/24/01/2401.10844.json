    "translated_abstract": "最近在神经计算领域取得了重要进展，采用了取胜带走(WTA)电路来促进分层贝叶斯推断和尖峰神经网络的统一，作为信息处理的神经生物学合理模型。目前的研究通常通过分类任务，特别是MNIST数据集，来验证这些网络的性能。然而，研究人员尚未就如何最佳地将这些网络的随机响应转化为离散决策达成一致，这个过程被称为群体解码。尽管群体解码是SNNs常常被忽视的部分，但在这项工作中，我们显示群体解码对WTA网络的分类性能有很大影响。为此，我们将WTA网络应用于多组学数据的癌症亚型诊断问题，使用了来自癌症基因图谱数据库(TCGA)的数据集。在这个过程中，我们利用了一种新颖的基因相似性网络实现。",
