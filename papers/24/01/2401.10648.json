    "translated_abstract": "了解人们在城市中如何使用区域是一种宝贵的信息，在从市场营销到城市规划等各个领域都具有重要价值。区域的使用会随着时间的推移而发生变化，受到季节变化和大流行等各种事件的影响。在智能手机普及之前，这些数据是通过问卷调查来收集的。然而，从时间效率和成本效益来看，这种方法并不可持续。目前存在许多关于区域建模的研究，这些研究使用兴趣点（POI）或区域间移动数据等某种信息来描述区域。然而，由于POI数据与空间静态绑定，区域间移动数据忽略了区域内人们的行为，现有方法在捕捉区域使用变化方面并不足够。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的区域建模方法Area2Vec，受Word2Vec启发，该方法基于人们的位置数据对区域进行建模。",
