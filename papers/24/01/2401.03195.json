The traditional one-size-fits-all scheme for bitrate ladders is inefficient and reaching the best content-aware decision computationally impractical due to extensive encodings required. To mitigate this, we propose a bitrate and complexity efficient bitrate ladder prediction method using transfer learning and spatio-temporal features. We propose: (1) using feature maps from well-known pre-trained DNNs to predict rate-quality behavior with limited training data; and (2) improving highest quality rung efficiency by predicting minimum bitrate for top quality and using it for the top rung. The method tested on 102 video scenes demonstrates 94.1% reduction in complexity versus brute-force at 1.71% BD-Rate expense. Additionally, transfer learning was thoroughly studied through four networks and ablation studies.",

    "translated_abstract": "在视频行业里，提供高质量的视频并保持比特率的效率是一个主要的挑战。传统的一刀切比特率梯度方案效率低下，并且由于需要进行大量的编码，使得计算最佳内容感知决策成为不现实。为了缓解这个问题，我们提出了一种使用迁移学习和时空特征的比特率和复杂度高效预测方法。我们提出了以下方法：（1）使用来自知名预训练深度神经网络的特征图来预测比特率质量行为，并限制训练数据的数量；（2）通过预测顶部质量的最小比特率来改进最高质量的梯度效率，并将其应用于顶部step。该方法在102个视频场景上进行了测试，结果显示，在1.71%的BD-Rate开销下，与蛮力方法相比，复杂度降低了94.1%。此外，我们还通过四个网络和消融研究深入研究了迁移学习。",
