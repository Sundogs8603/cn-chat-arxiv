    "translated_abstract": "对于物理学、化学和生物学来说，提取分子系统相关自由能极小值之间的一致统计数据至关重要。分子动力学（MD）模拟可以帮助完成这项任务，但对于需要量子精度的系统而言，计算代价很高。为了克服这一挑战，我们开发了一种结合增强采样、深度生成模型和主动学习机器学习势能（MLP）的方法。我们引入了一个自适应马尔科夫链蒙特卡洛框架，使得每个状态可以训练一个正则化流（NF）和一个MLP。我们并行模拟多个马尔科夫链直到收敛，使用高效的能量评估从玻尔兹曼分布中采样。在每次迭代中，我们使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算NF生成的配置子集的能量，用MLP预测剩余配置的能量，并使用DFT计算得到的能量对MLP进行主动训练。",
