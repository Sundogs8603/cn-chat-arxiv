    "abstract": "Deep learning algorithms are often said to be data hungry. The performance of such algorithms generally improve as more and more annotated data is fed into the model. While collecting unlabelled data is easier (as they can be scraped easily from the internet), annotating them is a tedious and expensive task. Given a fixed budget available for data annotation, Active Learning helps selecting the best subset of data for annotation, such that the deep learning model when trained over that subset will have maximum generalization performance under this budget. In this work, we aim to propose a new Active Learning approach which is model agnostic as well as one doesn't require an iterative process. We aim to leverage self-supervised learnt features for the task of Active Learning. The benefit of self-supervised learning, is that one can get useful feature representation of the input data, without having any annotation.",

    "translated_abstract": "人们常说深度学习算法对数据的需求很大。这些算法的性能通常随着注释数据的增加而改善。虽然收集未标记数据更容易（因为它们可以很容易地从互联网上获取），但注释它们是一项费时费力的任务。在给定的数据注释预算下，主动学习有助于选择适合注释的数据子集，以使在此预算下对该子集进行训练的深度学习模型具有最大的泛化性能。在这项工作中，我们旨在提出一种新的主动学习方法，它既是模型无关的，也不需要迭代过程。我们的目标是利用自监督学习得到的特征来进行主动学习任务。自监督学习的好处是，可以在没有任何注释的情况下获取输入数据的有用特征表示。",
