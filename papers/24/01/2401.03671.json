    "abstract": "This paper considers the dynamics of cheap talk interactions between a sender and receiver, departing from conventional models by focusing on the receiver's perspective. We study two models, one with transparent motives and another one in which the receiver can \\emph{filter} the information that is accessible by the sender. We give a geometric characterization of the best receiver equilibrium under transparent motives and prove that the receiver does not benefit from filtering information in this case. However, in general, we show that the receiver can strictly benefit from filtering and provide efficient algorithms for computing optimal equilibria. This innovative analysis aligns with user-based platforms where receivers (users) control information accessible to senders (sellers). Our findings provide insights into communication dynamics, leveling the sender's inherent advantage, and offering strategic interaction predictions.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了发送方和接收方之间廉价谈话交互的动态，与传统模型的不同之处在于侧重于接收方的角度。我们研究了两种模型，一种有透明的动机，另一种是接收方可以\\emph{过滤}发送方可以访问的信息。我们给出了在透明动机下最佳接收方均衡的几何特征，并证明接收方在这种情况下不会从过滤信息中获益。然而，一般情况下，我们显示接收方可以通过过滤获得严格的好处，并提供计算最优均衡的有效算法。这种创新性的分析与用户导向的平台一致，在这些平台上，接收方（用户）控制发送方（卖家）可以访问的信息。我们的发现揭示了通信动态，弥平了发送方固有的优势，并提供了策略性互动预测。",
