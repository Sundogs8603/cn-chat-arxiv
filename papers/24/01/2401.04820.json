    "translated_abstract": "随着互联网的兴起，我们的通信和工作方式发生了巨大的变化。虽然它为我们带来了新的机会，但也增加了网络威胁。其中一种常见且严重的威胁是网络钓鱼，黑客使用欺骗性方法窃取敏感信息。本研究通过引入一种基于HTML内容的先进检测模型，针对网络钓鱼问题进行了探讨。我们提出的方法集成了用于结构化表格数据的专门的多层感知器(MLP)模型和两个预训练的自然语言处理(NLP)模型，以分析页面标题和内容等文本特征。通过一种新颖的融合过程，这些模型生成的嵌入向量被和谐地组合在一起，并输入到线性分类器中。鉴于目前缺乏全面的网络钓鱼研究数据集，我们的贡献还包括创建一个最新的数据集",
