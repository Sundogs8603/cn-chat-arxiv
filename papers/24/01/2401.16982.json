    "abstract": "The growing popularity of Android requires malware detection systems that can keep up with the pace of new software being released. According to a recent study, a new piece of malware appears online every 12 seconds. To address this, we treat Android malware detection as a streaming data problem and explore the use of active online learning as a means of mitigating the problem of labelling applications in a timely and cost-effective manner. Our resulting framework achieves accuracies of up to 96\\%, requires as little of 24\\% of the training data to be labelled, and compensates for concept drift that occurs between the release and labelling of an application. We also consider the broader practicalities of online learning within Android malware detection, and systematically explore the trade-offs between using different static, dynamic and hybrid feature sets to classify malware.",

    "translated_abstract": "Android的日益普及要求恶意软件检测系统能够跟上新软件发布的速度。根据最近的研究，每12秒就有一种新的恶意软件出现在互联网上。为了解决这个问题，我们将Android恶意软件检测视为一个流数据问题，并探索使用主动在线学习作为一种及时和经济有效的标记应用程序的手段。我们的框架实现了高达96％的准确率，只需对24％的训练数据进行标记，并补偿了应用程序发布和标记之间发生的概念漂移。我们还考虑了Android恶意软件检测中在线学习的更广泛实用性，并系统地探讨了使用不同静态、动态和混合特征集对恶意软件进行分类的权衡。",
