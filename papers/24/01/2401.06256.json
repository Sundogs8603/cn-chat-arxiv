    "translated_abstract": "本文确定了42种用于创建通用人工智能（AGI）的认知架构，并提出了一组相互关联的功能模块，这些模块是接近AGI能力的智能系统所应具备的。由于现有的架构中没有找到所需的功能模块集合，本文提出了一种新的认知架构，用于接近AGI能力的智能系统。作为架构框架中的关键解决方案之一，本文提出了一种通用的知识表示方法，可以将各种非形式化、部分和完全形式化的知识表示方法结合在一个知识库中，如自然语言文本、图像、音频和视频记录、图形、算法、数据库、神经网络、知识图、本体、框架、实质-属性-关系模型、推理系统、谓词演算模型、概念模型等。为了组合和结构化各个片段",
