    "translated_abstract": "我们找到了经纪人和一群知情交易者之间随机游戏的闭合形式解。在有限玩家游戏中，知情交易者观察到一个公共信号和一个私有信号。经纪人则观察到每个客户的交易速度，并为知情交易者提供流动性。每个游戏中的玩家都通过库存惩罚来优化财富。在均场版本的游戏中，我们使用Gâteaux导数方法，通过求解明确的向前向后随机微分方程系统来描述游戏的解。我们发现，经纪人的最优交易策略是基于自己的库存、知情交易者之间的平均库存，以及公共信号或知情交易者的平均交易速度的线性关系。我们发现的纳什均衡帮助了知情交易者决定如何利用私有信息，以及帮助经纪人决定他们应该外部化多少订单流量。",
