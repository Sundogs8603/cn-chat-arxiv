To improve the scalability, we propose to use linear optimal transport to construct affinity matrices efficiently on large datasets.

    "translated_abstract": "离散分布聚类（D2C）通常通过Wasserstein质心方法来解决。这些方法在一个共同的假设下工作，即聚类可以通过质心很好地表示，但在许多实际应用中可能不成立。在本文中，我们提出了一个简单而有效的基于谱聚类和分布相似度度量（例如最大均值差异和Wasserstein距离）的框架来解决D2C问题。为了提高可扩展性，我们提出使用线性最优传输在大型数据集上高效地构建相似度矩阵。我们提供了理论保证，保证了所提方法在聚类分布方面的成功。在合成数据和真实数据上的实验证明，我们的方法在聚类准确性和计算效率方面大大优于基准方法。",
