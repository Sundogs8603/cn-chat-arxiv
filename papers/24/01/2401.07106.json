    "abstract": "We study the problem of deciding whether a given language is directed. A language $L$ is \\emph{directed} if every pair of words in $L$ have a common (scattered) superword in $L$. Deciding directedness is a fundamental problem in connection with ideal decompositions of downward closed sets. Another motivation is that deciding whether two \\emph{directed} context-free languages have the same downward closures can be decided in polynomial time, whereas for general context-free languages, this problem is known to be coNEXP-complete.  We show that the directedness problem for regular languages, given as NFAs, belongs to $AC^1$, and thus polynomial time. Moreover, it is NL-complete for fixed alphabet sizes. Furthermore, we show that for context-free languages, the directedness problem is PSPACE-complete.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究决定给定语言是否是定向语言的问题。一个语言L是\\emph{定向}的，如果L中的每对单词都有一个共同的（散乱的）超级词在L中。决定定向性是与向下封闭集合的理想分解相关的基本问题。另一个动机是决定两个\\emph{定向的}上下文无关语言是否具有相同的向下闭包可以在多项式时间内决定，而对于一般的上下文无关语言，这个问题被称为coNEXP-complete。我们证明了作为NFAs给出的正则语言的定向性问题属于$AC^1$，因此在多项式时间内。此外，对于固定字母表大小，它是NL-complete的。此外，我们还证明了对于上下文无关语言，定向性问题是PSPACE-complete的。",
