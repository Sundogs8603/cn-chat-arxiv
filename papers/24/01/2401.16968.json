    "abstract": "Recent approaches to automatically detect the speaker of an utterance of direct speech often disregard general information about characters in favor of local information found in the context, such as surrounding mentions of entities. In this work, we explore stylistic representations of characters built by encoding their quotes with off-the-shelf pretrained Authorship Verification models in a large corpus of English novels (the Project Dialogism Novel Corpus). Results suggest that the combination of stylistic and topical information captured in some of these models accurately distinguish characters among each other, but does not necessarily improve over semantic-only models when attributing quotes. However, these results vary across novels and more investigation of stylometric models particularly tailored for literary texts and the study of characters should be conducted.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近自动检测直接引语的讲话者的方法常常忽视关于角色的一般信息，而倾向于上下文中找到的局部信息，例如周围实体的提及。在这项工作中，我们探索了对角色进行风格表示的方法，通过使用现成的预训练作者验证模型在英语小说的大语料库（项目对话小说语料库）中编码他们的引语。结果表明，在一些这些模型中捕捉到的风格和主题信息的组合能够准确地区分不同的角色，但当归因引语时，不一定优于仅有语义的模型。然而，这些结果在不同的小说中有所变化，因此需要进行更多专门针对文学文本和角色研究设计的文体测量模型的研究。",
