    "translated_abstract": "可信的机器学习的一个关键因素是开发出对训练数据具有鲁棒性的表示方法。只有在此保证下，方法才能合法地人工生成数据，例如，对抗不平衡的数据集或为黑盒决策系统提供反事实解释。近年来，生成对抗网络（GANs）在形成稳定的表示和生成逼真数据方面取得了相当大的成果。虽然许多应用集中于生成图像数据，但在生成时间序列数据，特别是多变量信号方面，付出的努力较少。本文提出了一种基于Transformer的自编码器，通过对抗训练方案进行正则化，以生成人工多变量时间序列信号。通过t-SNE可视化、动态时间规整（DTW）和熵得分对表示进行评估。我们的结果表明，生成的信号与示例数据集的相似性较高，而不是使用常规的自编码器。",
