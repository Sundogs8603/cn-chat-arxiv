    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence based chatbots have brought unprecedented business potential. This study aims to explore consumers trust and response to a text-based chatbot in ecommerce, involving the moderating effects of task complexity and chatbot identity disclosure. A survey method with 299 useable responses was conducted in this research. This study adopted the ordinary least squares regression to test the hypotheses. First, the consumers perception of both the empathy and friendliness of the chatbot positively impacts their trust in it. Second, task complexity negatively moderates the relationship between friendliness and consumers trust. Third, disclosure of the text based chatbot negatively moderates the relationship between empathy and consumers trust, while it positively moderates the relationship between friendliness and consumers trust. Fourth, consumers trust in the chatbot increases their reliance on the chatbot and decreases their resistance to the chatbot in future interactio",

    "translated_abstract": "基于人工智能的聊天机器人带来了前所未有的商业潜力。本研究旨在探索消费者对电子商务中基于文本的聊天机器人的信任和反应，以及任务复杂性和聊天机器人身份披露的调节效应。通过299个可用的调查问卷收集了数据。本研究采用普通最小二乘回归分析来测试假设。首先，消费者对聊天机器人的共情和友好度的认知对他们的信任产生积极影响。其次，任务的复杂性负向调节了友好度与消费者信任之间的关系。第三，文本聊天机器人的披露负向调节了共情与消费者信任之间的关系，同时正向调节了友好度与消费者信任之间的关系。第四，消费者对聊天机器人的信任增加了他们对聊天机器人的依赖，并减少了他们对未来互动中的抵抗。",
