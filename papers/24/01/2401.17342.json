    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种新的方法，用于估计机器学习模型预测的置信度，特别是在利用地球观测数据进行回归任务时，重点关注蚊子种群（MA）估计。我们利用变分自动编码器的架构，通过EO数据的潜在空间表示来推导置信度度量。这种方法对于建立潜在表示中的欧几里得距离与个体MA预测的绝对误差（AE）之间的相关性至关重要。我们的研究重点关注了意大利威尼托地区和德国上莱茵河谷的EO数据集，这些地区受蚊子种群的影响显著。一个重要的发现是MA预测的AE与所提出的置信度度量之间存在0.46的显著相关性。这个相关性意味着这是一个稳健的、新的度量方法，用于量化AI模型在该背景下的预测可靠性和提高可信度。",
