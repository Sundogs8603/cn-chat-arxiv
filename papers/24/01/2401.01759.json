    "translated_abstract": "随着社交媒体的发展，谣言在社交媒体平台上广泛传播，给社会造成了巨大的危害。除了文本信息外，许多谣言还使用篡改的图像或将文本信息隐藏在图像中，以欺骗人们并避免被检测出来，使得多模态谣言检测成为一个关键问题。目前的多模态谣言检测方法主要集中于提取源索赔和相应图像的特征，而忽略了谣言的评论和传播结构。这些评论和结构蕴含着众人的智慧，并被证明对揭露谣言至关重要。此外，这些方法通常只以基本方式提取视觉特征，很少考虑图像中的篡改或文本信息。因此，在本研究中，我们提出了一种新颖的视觉和图形融合注意力网络（VGA）用于谣言检测，以利用帖子之间的传播结构，获取众人的意见和谣言。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文提出了一种名为VGA的视觉和图形融合注意力网络，用于多模态谣言检测。该方法不仅考虑了源索赔和图像的特征，还利用谣言的评论和传播结构来揭示谣言，并且能够有效处理图像篡改和文本信息隐藏等问题。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a Vision and Graph Fused Attention Network (VGA) for multimodal rumor detection, which takes into account both features of source claims and images, as well as the comments and propagation structures of the rumor. It effectively addresses the issues of image tampering and textual information concealment."
