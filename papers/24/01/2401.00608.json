    "translated_abstract": "相机陷阱在动物生态学中是宝贵的工具，用于生物多样性监测和保护。然而，挑战如在新的未知位置部署时的糟糕泛化限制了它们的实际应用。图像自然与可能在不同模态下的异质上下文相关联。在这项工作中，我们利用与相机陷阱图像相关联的结构化上下文，改善在相机陷阱中物种识别这个任务的超出分布的泛化能力。例如，一张野生动物的照片可能与拍摄地点和时间以及关于动物物种的结构化生物学知识相关联。虽然现有的工作通常忽视这一点，但将这样的上下文带回来可以带来一些潜在的好处，如解决数据稀缺和增强泛化能力。然而，有效地将这样的异质上下文整合到视觉领域是一个具有挑战性的问题。",
