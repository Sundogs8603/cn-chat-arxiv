    "translated_abstract": "本文着重研究了球面上的散点数据拟合问题。我们研究了一类加权谱滤波算法（包括Tikhonov正则化、Landaweber迭代、谱截断和迭代Tikhonov）在拟合可能存在的无界随机噪声的嘈杂数据时的逼近性能。为了分析这个问题，我们提出了一种积分算子方法，可以被看作是散点数据拟合领域中广泛使用的采样不等式方法和规范集方法的延伸。通过提供算子差异和数值积分规则之间的等价性，我们成功地推导出带权重谱滤波算法的Sobolev类型误差估计的最优结果。我们的误差估计不受文献中Tikhonov正则化的饱和现象、现有误差分析中的本地空间屏障和不同嵌入空间的影响。我们还提出了一种分而治之的方案，以提升加权谱滤波算法的效能。",
