    "translated_abstract": "由于人工智能行业的最新进展，机器学习作为服务（MLaaS）领域正在经历增长的实施。然而，这种增长引发了对AI防御机制的担忧，特别是对于来自不完全可信的第三方提供商的潜在隐蔽攻击。最近的研究发现，听觉后门可能使用某些修改作为其启动机制。DynamicTrigger作为一种方法被引入，用于进行使用巧妙设计的调整来确保损坏的样本与干净的样本无法区分的动态后门攻击。通过利用波动的信号采样率，并通过动态声音触发器（比如拍手声）对说话者身份进行掩盖，可以欺骗语音识别系统（ASR）。我们的实证测试表明，DynamicTrigger在隐蔽攻击中既有效又隐蔽，并在攻击过程中取得了令人印象深刻的成功率。",
