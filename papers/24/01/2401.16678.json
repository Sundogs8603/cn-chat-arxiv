    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a variety of classification experiments related to the task of fictional discourse detection. We utilize a diverse array of datasets, including contemporary professionally published fiction, historical fiction from the Hathi Trust, fanfiction, stories from Reddit, folk tales, GPT-generated stories, and anglophone world literature. Additionally, we introduce a new feature set of word \"supersenses\" that facilitate the goal of semantic generalization. The detection of fictional discourse can help enrich our knowledge of large cultural heritage archives and assist with the process of understanding the distinctive qualities of fictional storytelling more broadly.",
