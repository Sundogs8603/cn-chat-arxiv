    "abstract": "Suicide is recognized as one of the most serious concerns in the modern society. Suicide causes tragedy that affects countries, communities, and families. There are many factors that lead to suicidal ideations. Early detection of suicidal ideations can help to prevent suicide occurrence by providing the victim with the required professional support, especially when the victim does not recognize the danger of having suicidal ideations. As technology usage has increased, people share and express their ideations digitally via social media, chatbots, and other digital platforms. In this paper, we proposed a novel, simple deep learning-based model to detect suicidal ideations in digital content, mainly focusing on chatbots as the primary data source. In addition, we provide a framework that employs the proposed suicide detection integration with a chatbot-based support system.",

    "translated_abstract": "自杀被认为是现代社会最严重的问题之一。自杀造成了对国家、社区和家庭的悲剧性影响。有许多因素导致自杀意向。早期发现自杀意向可以通过为受害者提供所需的专业支持来防止自杀发生，尤其是当受害者没有意识到自杀意向的危险时。随着科技的使用增加，人们通过社交媒体、聊天机器人和其他数字平台在数字内容中分享和表达自己的意向。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖而简单的基于深度学习的模型，用于检测数字内容中的自杀意向，主要关注聊天机器人作为主要数据源。此外，我们提供了一个框架，将所提出的自杀检测集成到基于聊天机器人的支持系统中。",
