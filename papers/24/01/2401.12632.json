    "translated_abstract": "碰撞化人工智能系统（CAIS）与人类合作执行行动以实现共同目标。 CAIS可以使用经过训练的人工智能模型来控制人-系统交互，也可以使用人类交互以在线方式动态地从人类中学习。在带有人类反馈的在线学习中，通过系统传感器在学习状态下监测人类交互，AI模型通过学习在操作状态下激活CAIS的自主组件。因此，任何影响这些传感器的不利事件可能会影响AI模型做出准确决策的能力并降低CAIS的性能。因此，CAIS管理者能够自动跟踪系统性能以了解CAIS在此类不利事件中的韧性至关重要。在本文中，我们提供了一个新的框架，用于在系统遇到不利事件时建模CAIS的性能。",
