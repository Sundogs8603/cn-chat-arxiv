    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络(GNN)是一种在科学领域中具有广泛应用的图机器学习模型。然而，GNN被认为是黑盒模型，很难理解模型如何进行预测。基于博弈论的Shapley值方法在其他领域中被广泛应用于解释模型，但在图领域中研究较少。一些研究已经提出了基于Shapley值的GNN解释方法，然而它们存在一些限制：它们只考虑了有限的样本来近似Shapley值；有些方法主要关注小和大的联盟大小，并且它们比其他解释方法慢了一个数量级，使得它们在中等规模的图中无法应用。在这项工作中，我们提出了GNNShap，它提供边的解释，因为它们对图提供了更自然和精细的解释。我们通过对所有联盟大小进行抽样、在GPU上并行抽样和加速模型等方面克服了这些限制。",

    "en_tdlr": "GNNShap is an explanation method for graph neural networks that uses Shapley values to provide fast and accurate explanations for predictions. It overcomes limitations of previous methods by sampling from all coalition sizes, parallelizing the sampling process, and improving the speed and granularity of explanations."
