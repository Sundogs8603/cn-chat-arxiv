    "translated_abstract": "实时准确地获取作物栽培的细微变化信息对于作物生长监测、产量预测和农业结构调整具有重要意义。针对可见光高分辨率无人机图像在不同阶段存在严重光谱混淆，现有语义变化检测算法受到大型复杂背景干扰和椒盐噪声的问题，为了有效提取作物的深度图像特征，并满足农业实际工程应用的需求，本文设计和提出了一种农业地理场景和基于地块尺度约束的作物语义变化检测框架（AGSPNet）。AGSPNet框架包括农业地理场景（AGS）分割模块、地块边缘提取模块和作物语义变化检测模块。同时，我们还设计了一个针对农业监测的无人机图像语义变化检测数据集（CSCD），包含多个语义变化场景。",
