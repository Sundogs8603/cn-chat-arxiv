    "translated_abstract": "基于多元t分布的因子分析（tfa）是一种在重尾或受污染数据上提取公共因子的有用的鲁棒工具。然而，tfa只适用于向量数据。当tfa应用于矩阵数据时，通常会先将矩阵观测向量化。这带来了两个挑战：（i）数据的固有矩阵结构被破坏，（ii）鲁棒性可能丢失，因为向量化的矩阵数据通常会导致较高的数据维度，这容易导致tfa的崩溃。为了解决这些问题，本文从矩阵数据的内在结构出发，提出了一种新的鲁棒因子分析模型，即基于矩阵变量t分布的双线性因子分析（tbfa）。其创新之处在于它能够同时对感兴趣的行和列变量从重尾或受污染的矩阵数据中提取公共因子。本文提出了两种最大似然估计的高效算法来求解模型参数。",
