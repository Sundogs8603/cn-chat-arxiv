    "abstract": "Traditionally, European social policies have focused on material well-being and social justice, neglecting subjective indicators. This review systematically examines the scientific understanding of well-being, its indicators, and its relationship with governance. It suggests that political systems and institutions significantly impact well-being, and that subjective indicators should be incorporated into public policy decisions. The findings advocate for a more holistic approach to well-being measurement, encompassing both objective and subjective dimensions.",
