So, early diagnosis of skin cancer is very desired. In the last few years, there is a growing interest in computer aided diagnostic (CAD) using most image and clinical data of the lesion.

The most commonly used techniques and classification algorithms used in spectroscopy are Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

    "translated_abstract": "皮肤病变可以分为良性和恶性。在恶性病变中，黑色素瘤是一种非常侵袭性的癌症，也是导致死亡的主要原因。因此，早期诊断皮肤癌非常重要。近年来，人们对使用图像和临床数据在计算机辅助诊断（CAD）中的兴趣越来越大。然而，这些信息来源存在限制，因为它们不能提供病变分子结构的信息。近红外光谱可以为皮肤病变的自动CAD提供替代信息来源。光谱学中最常用的技术和分类算法是主成分分析（PCA）、偏最小二乘-判别分析（PLS-DA）和支持向量机（SVM）。然而，人们对将现代机器学习和深度学习（MDL）应用于光谱学的兴趣日益增长。而将MDL应用于光谱学的主要限制之一是缺乏公共数据集。",
