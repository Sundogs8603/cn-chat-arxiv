    "translated_abstract": "气候变化对各个国家或地区的商品和服务价格影响不同。仅仅依赖于总体测量或摘要统计数据，例如国家平均温度变化对HICP总体通胀的影响，隐藏了经济部门（亚部门）间的巨大异质性。此外，气象异常对消费者价格的影响不仅取决于其符号和大小，还取决于其位置以及受冲击影响的区域的规模。对于具有多样气候区域的大国或地区来说尤其如此，因为气候效应的地理分布对塑造经济结果起到了作用。通过使用地理位置的时间序列数据，我们证明仅仅依赖国家平均值不能充分捕捉和解释气候对欧元区消费者物价的影响。我们得出结论，丰富而复杂的表面数据中隐藏的信息内容可以提供有价值的洞见。",
