    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型 (LLMs) 和多模态大型语言模型 (MLLMs) 已经展现出了出色的通用能力，甚至在法律、经济、交通和医学等许多专业领域表现出了适应性。目前，已提出了许多领域特定的基准来验证 (M)LLMs 在特定领域的性能。在各种不同领域中，交通运输在现代社会中扮演着至关重要的角色，因为它影响着经济、环境和数十亿人民生活的质量。然而，目前尚不清楚 (M)LLMs 多少交通知识，并且它们是否可以可靠地执行与交通相关的任务。为了弥补这一空白，我们提出了 TransportationGames，这是一个经过精心设计和全面评估的基准测试，用于评估(M)LLMs 在交通领域中的表现。通过综合考虑现实场景中的应用，并参照布鲁姆分类法的前三个层次，我们测试了各种(M)LLMs 在记忆交通知识、推理交通概念、解释和评估交通问题等方面的表现。",
