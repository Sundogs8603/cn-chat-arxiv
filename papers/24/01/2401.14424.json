    "translated_abstract": "在科学研究和人工智能中，找到一个简洁且可解释的数学公式来准确描述数据中每个变量与预测值之间的关系是一个关键任务，也是一个重大挑战。这个问题被称为符号回归，是一个NP困难问题。去年，提出了一种基于蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）的符号回归方法，并在多个数据集上获得了sota。虽然与以前的方法相比，该算法在恢复目标表达式方面显示出了相当大的改进，但是在MCTS过程中缺乏引导严重阻碍了其搜索效率。最近，一些算法在MCTS的搜索中添加了一个预训练的策略网络，但是这个预训练的策略网络的泛化能力很差。为了平衡效率和通用性，我们提出了SR-GPT，结合了AlphaZero的思想。SR-GPT是一种新的符号回归算法，将MCTS与一个通用性较好的生成式预训练模型相结合。",
