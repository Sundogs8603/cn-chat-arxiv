    "abstract": "The recent advances in natural language processing have predominantly favored well-resourced English-centric models, resulting in a significant gap with low-resource languages. In this work, we introduce the language model TURNA, which is developed for the low-resource language Turkish and is capable of both natural language understanding and generation tasks. TURNA is pretrained with an encoder-decoder architecture based on the unified framework UL2 with a diverse corpus that we specifically curated for this purpose. We evaluated TURNA with three generation tasks and five understanding tasks for Turkish. The results show that TURNA outperforms several multilingual models in both understanding and generation tasks, and competes with monolingual Turkish models in understanding tasks. TURNA is made available at https://huggingface.co/boun-tabi-LMG/TURNA .",

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理的最新进展主要偏向于资源丰富且以英语为中心的模型，这导致了与资源稀缺的语言之间存在显著差距。在这项工作中，我们介绍了TURNA语言模型，该模型针对资源稀缺的土耳其语开发，能够进行自然语言理解和生成任务。TURNA使用基于统一框架UL2的编码-解码架构进行预训练，并且我们专门为此目的筛选了一个多样的语料库。我们对TURNA在土耳其语的三个生成任务和五个理解任务上进行了评估。结果表明，TURNA在理解和生成任务上优于多语言模型，并与土耳其语单语模型在理解任务上竞争。TURNA已在https://huggingface.co/boun-tabi-LMG/TURNA 上提供。",
