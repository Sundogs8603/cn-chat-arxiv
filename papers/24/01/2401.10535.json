    "translated_abstract": "尽管殖民主义在社会历史上对人们的身份产生了各种影响，但这些殖民的价值观和偏见仍通过社会技术系统得到了延续。一类社会技术系统，情感分析工具，也可能延续殖民的价值观和偏见，然而，对这些工具可能如何与殖民主义的延续相关联的关注却较少，尽管它们经常被用来指导各种实践（例如，内容管理）。在本文中，我们探讨了在经历和继续经历殖民主义影响的孟加拉社群背景下，情感分析工具可能存在的偏见。我们根据当地孟加拉社群中受殖民主义影响最大的身份类别，重点关注了性别、宗教和国籍。我们对在Python包索引(PyPI)和GitHub上提供的所有孟加拉情感分析工具进行了算法审查。尽管语义内容相似，但我们发现这些工具在处理与孟加拉社群有关的情感时存在偏见。",
    "tldr": "本研究审查了在孟加拉社群中经历殖民主义影响的情感分析工具，发现它们可能存在基于身份的偏见，并提出了警示。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper examines sentiment analysis tools used in Bengali communities that have experienced colonialism and finds that such tools may exhibit identity-based biases, indicating a need for awareness."
