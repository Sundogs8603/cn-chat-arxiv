    "abstract": "Revenues obtained from the corporate tax heads play significant roles in any economy as they can be prioritized for producing public goods and employment creations, among others. As such, corporate tax revenue should be paid enough attention. This study, therefore, explores the tax-revenue harvesting system of an economy where we focused on the corporate tax head. The system comprises three players; the government and formal and informal firms. We applied the predator-prey model to model the effect of the government-gazetted tax rate on corporate survivability. It is a new approach to modeling economic system relations and games. Critical combinatory points are derived, with stability analysis provided after that. Dynamics associated with the tax-revenue system are established and critically analyzed. Lastly, we provide the mathematical way the system can be optimized for the government to harvest as much Revenue as possible, including optimal conditions.",

    "translated_abstract": "企业税收对于任何经济体而言都扮演着重要角色，可以用于生产公共物品和创造就业机会等。因此，应该足够重视企业税收收入。本研究探讨了一个经济体中涉及企业税收的税收收获系统，其中我们关注企业税收的影响。该系统包括政府、正式企业和非正式企业三个参与者。我们应用捕食-被捕食模型来模拟政府规定税率对企业生存能力的影响。这是一种对经济系统关系和博弈进行建模的新方法。在此基础上，我们推导出关键的组合点，并提供稳定性分析。确定了与税收收入系统相关联的动态，并进行了详尽的分析。最后，我们提供了政府如何通过优化该系统以最大程度地收获收入的数学方法，包括优化的条件。",
