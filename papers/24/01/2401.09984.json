    "abstract": "ChatGPT, as a language model based on large-scale pre-training, has exerted a profound influence on the domain of machine translation. In ChatGPT, a \"Prompt\" refers to a segment of text or instruction employed to steer the model towards generating a specific category of response. The design of the translation prompt emerges as a key aspect that can wield influence over factors such as the style, precision and accuracy of the translation to a certain extent. However, there is a lack of a common standard and methodology on how to design and select a translation prompt. Accordingly, this paper proposes a generic taxonomy, which defines gradable translation prompts in terms of expression type, translation style, POS information and explicit statement, thus facilitating the construction of prompts endowed with distinct attributes tailored for various translation tasks. Specific experiments and cases are selected to validate and illustrate the effectiveness of the method.",

    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT作为一种基于大规模预训练的语言模型，在机器翻译领域产生了深远影响。在ChatGPT中，“提示”是指用于引导模型生成特定类型回应的文本段落或指导。翻译提示的设计成为影响翻译风格、准确性和精确度等因素的关键方面。然而，目前缺乏一个共同的标准和方法来设计和选择翻译提示。因此，本文提出了一种通用分类系统，以表达类型、翻译风格、POS信息和显式声明的方式定义可分级的翻译提示，从而为不同的翻译任务构建具有不同特性的提示。选择了具体的实验和案例来验证和说明该方法的有效性。",
