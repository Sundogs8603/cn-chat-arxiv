    "translated_abstract": "扩散生成模型在生成固定分辨率的图像方面取得了显著的成功。然而，现有模型在没有相应分辨率的训练数据时，很难推广到不同的分辨率。借鉴操作符学习技术，我们提出了一种新的深度学习架构，Dual-FNO UNet (DFU)，通过在多个分辨率上同时组合空间和光谱信息来近似评分操作符。将DFU与基准模型进行比较，我们证明其可扩展性：1）在多个分辨率上同时训练可以改善FID，而单一固定分辨率的训练则不能实现；2）DFU可以推广到其训练分辨率之外，实现高分辨率的协调、高保真度的图像生成，即零样本超分辨率图像生成；3）我们提出了一种微调策略来进一步提高我们模型的零样本超分辨率图像生成能力，使FID为11.3。",
