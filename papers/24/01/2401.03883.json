    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering-based recommender systems leverage vast amounts of behavioral user data, which poses severe privacy risks. Thus, often, random noise is added to the data to ensure Differential Privacy (DP). However, to date, it is not well understood, in which ways this impacts personalized recommendations. In this work, we study how DP impacts recommendation accuracy and popularity bias, when applied to the training data of state-of-the-art recommendation models. Our findings are three-fold: First, we find that nearly all users' recommendations change when DP is applied. Second, recommendation accuracy drops substantially while recommended item popularity experiences a sharp increase, suggesting that popularity bias worsens. Third, we find that DP exacerbates popularity bias more severely for users who prefer unpopular items than for users that prefer popular items.",

    "translated_abstract": "基于协同过滤的推荐系统利用大量的用户行为数据，这带来了严重的隐私风险。因此，通常会向数据中添加随机噪声以确保差分隐私（DP）。然而，迄今为止，人们对DP如何影响个性化推荐的方式并不清楚。在这项工作中，我们研究了DP应用于最先进的推荐模型的训练数据时，对推荐准确性和流行偏差的影响。我们的发现有三个：首先，我们发现几乎所有用户的推荐都会在应用DP后发生变化。其次，推荐准确性大幅下降，而推荐物品的流行度急剧增加，表明流行偏差加剧。第三，我们发现，与喜欢流行物品的用户相比，喜欢不受欢迎物品的用户会更严重地受到DP的流行偏差影响。",
