    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了A2C，一个多阶段人工智能团队合作决策框架，旨在实现人工智能团队内强大的决策制定能力。A2C从拒绝学习和学习推迟等概念中获得灵感，将训练有素的人工智能系统纳入其决策过程中，使其能够识别自己决策中的不确定性并在需要时推迟到人类专家。此外，A2C适用于即使是人类专家也会遇到限制的场景，例如在网络安全运营中心（SOC）中的事件检测和响应。在这种情况下，A2C促进了协作探索，实现了对复杂挑战的集体解决。A2C支持人工智能团队中三种不同的决策模式：自动化、增强型和协作型，为人工智能与人类的有效协作策略开发提供了灵活的平台。通过充分发挥人类和人工智能的优势，A2C显著提高了动态和不断变化环境中复杂决策制定的效率和效果。",
