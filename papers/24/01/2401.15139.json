    "abstract": "In high-dimensional data analysis, such as financial index tracking or biomedical applications, it is crucial to select the few relevant variables while maintaining control over the false discovery rate (FDR). In these applications, strong dependencies often exist among the variables (e.g., stock returns), which can undermine the FDR control property of existing methods like the model-X knockoff method or the T-Rex selector. To address this issue, we have expanded the T-Rex framework to accommodate overlapping groups of highly correlated variables. This is achieved by integrating a nearest neighbors penalization mechanism into the framework, which provably controls the FDR at the user-defined target level. A real-world example of sparse index tracking demonstrates the proposed method's ability to accurately track the S&P 500 index over the past 20 years based on a small number of stocks. An open-source implementation is provided within the R package TRexSelector on CRAN.",

    "translated_abstract": "在高维数据分析中，如金融指数跟踪或生物医学应用中，关键是在保持对误发现率（FDR）的控制的同时选择少数相关变量。在这些应用中，变量之间经常存在强依赖关系（例如股票收益），这可能会削弱现有方法（如模型X knockoff方法或T-Rex选择器）的FDR控制特性。为了解决这个问题，我们扩展了T-Rex框架，以适应高度相关变量的重叠组。这是通过将最近邻惩罚机制集成到框架中实现的，该机制能够在用户定义的目标水平上可靠控制FDR。稀疏指数跟踪的实例展示了该方法在过去20年内基于少量股票准确跟踪标准普尔500指数的能力。在CRAN上提供了R包TRexSelector的开源实现。",
