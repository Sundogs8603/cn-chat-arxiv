    "translated_abstract": "尽管语言模型在文本推理和分类任务中取得了许多里程碑式的成果，但它们仍然容易受到对抗性攻击的影响，可能导致意想不到的结果。现有的工作通过为语言模型增加防御补丁来缓解这个问题。然而，这些防御策略往往依赖于不切实际的假设或者需要在模型性能方面做出巨大的牺牲。因此，使用这些防御机制来提高目标模型的弹性是一个严峻的挑战。本文介绍了一种创新的用于强化文本推理和分类的模型，基于扩散模型（ROIC-DM）。由于其训练过程涉及去噪阶段，ROIC-DM本质上比传统的语言模型具有更强的鲁棒性。此外，ROIC-DM还可以通过有效地将其作为咨询组件纳入，达到与语言模型相当甚至更优秀的性能。在多个强文本上进行的大量实验证明了ROIC-DM的有效性。",
