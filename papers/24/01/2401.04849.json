    "translated_abstract": "现有的空间交互模型（SIM）在捕捉商业集群与贸易区之间复杂的、与环境相关的互动方面存在局限性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个SIM-GAT模型，用于预测社区商业集群与其贸易区之间的时空访问流量。该模型创新地使用连通图表示城市地区内的商业集群、贸易区和交通基础设施的综合系统。然后，使用基于图的深度学习模型，即Graph AttenTion network (GAT)，来捕捉商业集群的复杂性和相互依赖关系。我们使用佛罗里达州迈阿密都市区收集的数据开发了这个模型。然后，我们使用可解释的AI方法证明了其在捕捉不同居民社区对商业集群的吸引力以及不同情景下的有效性。我们对预测和分析传统SIM的新方法进行了贡献。",
