    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了比特币持有时间分布的时间演化，并发现平均持有时间分布是一个从一天到至少200周的重尾幂律分布，指数约等于0.9，表明存在非常长的记忆效应。我们还报告了持有时间分布的显著样本间变化，可以最好地描述为多尺度特性，幂律指数在0.3到2.5之间变化，取决于比特币价格的不同阶段。我们证明了订单到市场和实现收益的分布存在显著差异，表明交易者的表现远非最佳。我们还报告了对比特币区块链数据中处置效应的强有力的定性和定量证据。我们将一个给定时间内交易的比特币数量以及在特定先前时间内被创建（最后交易）的比特币数量定义为年龄相关的交易流，并证明了...

    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the scaling laws and statistical properties of the transaction flows and holding times of Bitcoin. The findings indicate heavy-tailed power law distribution in the average holding-time, indicating long memory effects. The study also reveals multiscaling properties in the distribution of holding times, with variations depending on Bitcoin price regimes. Moreover, it demonstrates suboptimal performance of traders and provides evidence of the disposition effect in Bitcoin Blockchain data."
