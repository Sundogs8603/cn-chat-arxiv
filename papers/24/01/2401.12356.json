This is foundational for our system, directing the formation of coalitions among devices based on the closeness of their model weights. Furthermore, the concept of a barycenter, representing the average of model weights, helps in the aggregation of updates from multiple devices. We evaluate our approach using homogeneous and heterogeneous data distribution, comparing it against traditional federated learning averaging algorithm.
