    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）是基于Transformer架构，在多样的数据上进行大规模预训练的，它们不仅在自然语言处理领域引起了革命，还将其能力扩展到了各个领域，迈向了人工通用智能的重要一步。尽管进化算法（EAs）与LLMs在目标和方法论上存在差异，但它们之间的相互作用揭示了有趣的相似之处，特别是在他们共同的优化性质、黑盒特性和处理复杂问题的能力方面。与此同时，进化算法不仅可以为LLM在黑盒设置下提供优化框架，还可以在应用中为LLM赋予灵活的全局搜索和迭代机制。另一方面，LLM丰富的领域知识使得进化算法可以进行更智能的搜索，而其文本处理能力则有助于将进化算法应用于各种任务。基于它们的互补优势，本文提出了一份调查和路线图。",
