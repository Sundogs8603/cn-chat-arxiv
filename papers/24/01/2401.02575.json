    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）正在改变人们生成、探索和参与内容的方式。本研究探讨如何在在线社交网络中开发LLM应用。尽管LLMs在其他领域取得了成功，但在社交网络中开发基于LLM的产品面临着许多挑战，并且在研究界中相对较少报道。我们将社交网络中的LLM应用分为三类。第一类是知识任务，用户想要查找新知识和信息，例如搜索和问答。第二类是娱乐任务，用户想要消费有趣的内容，例如获取娱乐性通知内容。第三类是基础任务，需要进行社交网络的内容注释和LLM监控。针对每个任务，我们分享了我们发现的挑战、开发的解决方案和吸取的经验教训。据我们所知，这是第一个全面的研究关于在社交网络中应用LLMs的研究。",
