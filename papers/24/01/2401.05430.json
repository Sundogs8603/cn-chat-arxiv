    "translated_abstract": "股票趋势分类仍然是一项基本但具有挑战性的任务，因为股票之间和内部之间的复杂时变动力学。为了解决这两个挑战，我们提出了一种基于图的表示学习方法，旨在预测多个股票的未来走势。首先，我们通过生成动态多关系股票图来建模股票之间复杂的时变关系。这是通过一种新颖的边生成算法实现的，该算法利用信息熵和信号能量来量化每个交易日的股票之间关系的强度和方向性。然后，我们通过随机的多关系扩散过程进一步优化这些初始图，自适应地学习任务最优边。随后，我们使用并行保留的解耦表示学习方案来获得最终的图表示。这种策略更好地捕捉了各个股票内部的独特时间特征，同时也能够考虑股票之间的关系。",
