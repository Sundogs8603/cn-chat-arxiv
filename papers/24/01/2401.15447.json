    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了个性化连续处理效果（ICTE）估计问题，通过观测数据预测任何连续值处理对个体的效果。这个估计任务的主要挑战是训练数据中处理分配与个体协变量的潜在混淆，而在推断ICTE时需要对独立采样的处理进行预测。与之前依赖于正则化器或不稳定的GAN训练的工作相反，我们主张直接方法，即通过增加独立采样的处理和推断的反事实结果来增强训练个体。 我们使用两种策略推断反事实结果：对接近观察到的处理进行梯度插值，以及基于高斯过程的核平滑，使我们能够减小推断的高方差。我们在五个基准测试上评估我们的方法，并显示我们的方法在反事实预测性能上胜过六种最先进的方法。",
