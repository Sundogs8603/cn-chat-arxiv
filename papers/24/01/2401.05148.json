    "translated_abstract": "如今，学习越来越多地涉及到搜索引擎和网络资源的使用。相关的跨学科研究领域“搜索即学习”旨在理解人们在网络上的学习方式。以往的研究已经调查了几种特征类别，以预测例如在Web搜索过程中预期的知识获取量。然而，目前为止，尚未对注视追踪特征进行深入研究。在本文中，我们将之前使用的基于行的阅读模型扩展为可以检测多行阅读序列的模型。我们使用公开可用的基于Web的学习任务的研究数据，来研究我们的特征集与参与者的测试成绩之间的关系。我们的研究结果表明，知识获取量较高的学习者在阅读上花费了更多时间，并且总体上阅读了更多的文字。我们还发现，以牺牲更多回退的方式更快地阅读可能是网络学习较好的指标。我们将我们的代码公开。",
