    "translated_abstract": "薄板样条（TPS）是一种允许使用控制点运动表示弹性非线性变换的主要变形方式。随着控制点数量的增加，变形越来越灵活，但常常会遇到由不希望的问题（如内容畸变）导致的瓶颈。本文探索了TPS在基于单幅图像的变形任务中的通用应用，如旋转校正、矩形化和肖像校正。为了突破这个瓶颈，我们提出了耦合薄板样条模型（CoupledTPS），它将有限控制点的多个TPS迭代耦合成一个更灵活和强大的变换。具体来说，我们首先设计了一个迭代搜索来根据当前潜在条件预测新的控制点。然后，我们以变形流作为连接不同TPS变换的桥梁，有效消除了多个变形引起的插值误差。此外，鉴于繁琐的注释成为制约深度学习方法效果的重要因素，我们还提出了一种半监督学习方法，使得在有限带标注样本条件下，能充分利用未标注样本来提高模型性能。",
