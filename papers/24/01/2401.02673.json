    "translated_abstract": "远场语音识别是一个具有挑战性的任务，传统上使用信号处理波束形成来解决噪声和干扰问题。但是由于对环境假设的严重依赖，性能通常受到限制。本文提出了一个统一的多通道远场语音识别系统，该系统结合了神经波束形成和基于变压器的Listen, Spell, Attend (LAS)语音识别系统，进一步扩展了端到端语音识别系统，包括语音增强。然后，这个框架被共同训练以优化最终的目标。具体地，采用分解复线性投影(fCLP)来形成神经波束形成。然后比较了几种合并方向的汇聚策略，以找到最优的方法。此外，源方向的信息也被集成到波束形成中，探索源方向作为先验知识的有用性，这通常是不常见的。",
