    "translated_abstract": "时间序列预测任务是基于历史信息预测未来趋势。最近基于U-Net的方法在预测真实数据集方面表现出优越性能。然而，这些模型的性能比基于补丁模型或线性模型的模型低。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种对称和层次化的框架，Kernel-U-Net，它在网络的每一层将输入序列切割成片段，然后使用卷积核进行计算。此外，它扩展了经典U-Net中的卷积核的概念，可以接受符合相同设计模式的自定义卷积核。与现有的线性或基于transformer的解决方案相比，我们的模型具有三个优势：1）参数数量较少：参数大小为$O(log(L)^2)$，其中$L$为回溯窗口大小；2）灵活性：其卷积核可以定制和适应数据集；3）计算效率：如果使用此模型，transformer模块的计算复杂度减小为$O(log(L)^2)$。",
