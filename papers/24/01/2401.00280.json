    "translated_abstract": "战术，技术和程序（TTPs）概述了攻击者利用漏洞的方法。由于假定的专业知识，复杂的依赖关系和内在的模糊性，对MITRE ATT＆CK框架中的TTPs的解释对于网络安全从业人员来说可能具有挑战性。与此同时，大型语言模型（LLMs）的进步导致了最近在研究中探索其在网络安全操作中的用途的激增。这引起了我们的疑问，仅编码器（例如RoBERTa）和仅解码器（例如GPT-3.5）LLMs对于理解和总结TTPs以通知分析人员有关网络攻击过程的预期目的（即策略）的能力如何。最先进的LLMs已经显示出容易产生错误信息，这在网络安全等关键领域是有问题的。因此，我们提出使用检索增强生成（RAG）技术来为仅解码器的LLMs提取每个网络攻击过程的相关上下文（无需微调）。",
