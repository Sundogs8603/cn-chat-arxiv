    "translated_abstract": "随着汽车对外部世界的连接增加，增加了车辆自动化程度，暴露了以前独立存在的汽车网络，如控制区域网络（CAN）的漏洞。CAN的特性，如基于广播的电子控制单元（ECU）之间的通信降低了部署成本，现在被利用来进行主动注入攻击，如拒绝服务（DoS），模糊测试和欺骗攻击。研究文献提出了多个以监督机器学习模型为基础的入侵检测系统（IDS）来检测这种恶意活动; 但是，这些模型很大程度上局限于识别先前已知的攻击向量。随着主动注入攻击复杂性的不断增加，实时检测这些网络中的零日（新颖）攻击（以防止传播）成为一个特别感兴趣的问题。本文提出了一种基于无监督学习的卷积自编码器架构，用于实时检测零日攻击。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents an unsupervised learning-based convolutional autoencoder architecture for real-time detection of zero-day attacks in automotive controller area networks. It addresses the detection problem of zero-day attacks in these networks, which is of particular interest due to the increasing complexity of active injection attacks and the need to prevent their propagation."
