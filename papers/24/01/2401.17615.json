    "translated_abstract": "有效的分子表示学习对于分子属性预测至关重要。对分子表示学习而言，对比学习是一种明显的自监督方法，它依赖于建立正负对。然而，这种二进制相似性分类过于简化了复杂分子关系的性质，并忽视了分子之间相对相似性的程度，给表示学习的效果和泛化性带来挑战。为了应对这一挑战，我们提出了用于分子属性预测的图多相似性学习(GraphMSL)框架。GraphMSL将广义多相似性度量融入到连续尺度中，包括自相似度和相对相似性。单模多相似性度量来自于各种化学模态，而这些度量的融合形式则显著增强了GraphMSL的效果。此外，融合的灵活性能够适应不同任务需求，使得GraphMSL在分子属性预测中具备更广的适用性。",
