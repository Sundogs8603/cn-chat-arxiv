    "translated_abstract": "随着LLMs在我们生活的许多方面的应用，科学研究领域是一个需要增加审查的地方。LLMs被用于生成或分析研究数据的应用正变得越来越流行。但是，当这种应用被临时决策和工程解决方案所困扰时，我们需要关注它如何影响研究、研究结果或者基于该研究的任何未来工作。我们需要更科学的方法来在我们的研究中使用LLMs。虽然目前有一些积极的努力支持更系统的提示构建，但它们往往更注重实现期望的结果，而不是产生可复制和具有足够透明度、客观性或严谨性的广泛知识。本文提出了一种新的方法，灵感来自通过定性方法构建代码书的方法，以解决这个问题。通过人在循环和多阶段验证过程，该方法为更系统的研究打下了基础。",
