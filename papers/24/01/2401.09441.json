    "abstract": "This paper presents VoxCeleb-ESP, a collection of pointers and timestamps to YouTube videos facilitating the creation of a novel speaker recognition dataset. VoxCeleb-ESP captures real-world scenarios, incorporating diverse speaking styles, noises, and channel distortions. It includes 160 Spanish celebrities spanning various categories, ensuring a representative distribution across age groups and geographic regions in Spain. We provide two speaker trial lists for speaker identification tasks, each of them with same-video or different-video target trials respectively, accompanied by a cross-lingual evaluation of ResNet pretrained models. Preliminary speaker identification results suggest that the complexity of the detection task in VoxCeleb-ESP is equivalent to that of the original and much larger VoxCeleb in English. VoxCeleb-ESP contributes to the expansion of speaker recognition benchmarks with a comprehensive and diverse dataset for the Spanish language.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了VoxCeleb-ESP，这是一个指向YouTube视频的指针和时间戳集合，便于创建一个新的说话人识别数据集。VoxCeleb-ESP捕捉了真实世界的场景，包括各种说话风格、噪音和信道失真。它包括了160个西班牙名人，涵盖了西班牙各个年龄组和地理区域，以确保代表性分布。我们为说话人识别任务提供了两个说话人试验列表，分别是同一视频和不同视频的目标试验，并伴有ResNet预训练模型的跨语言评估。初步的说话人识别结果表明，VoxCeleb-ESP中的检测任务的复杂性与原版更大的英语VoxCeleb相当。VoxCeleb-ESP通过提供一个全面多样的西班牙语数据集，为说话人识别基准的扩展做出了贡献。",
