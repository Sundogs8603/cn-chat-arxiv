    "translated_abstract": "最近，引入了一种专门用于具有符号间干扰的信道的数据驱动型Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv（BCJR）算法。这种被称为BCJRNet算法利用神经网络计算信道的似然概率。BCJRNet在应用于具有理想指数衰减特性的定态信道时表现出对信道衰减估计不准确的鲁棒性。然而，对于实际中常见的时变信道以及接收机只能获取到错误的信道参数的情况，BCJRNet的泛化能力尚未得到充分探索。本文的主要贡献是对现有文献中的结果进行扩展，涵盖了实际传输中出现的各种不完全信道知识情况。我们的研究结果表明，通过学习噪声信道数据和不完全信道衰减特性，在定态传输场景下，BCJRNet显著优于传统的BCJR算法。然而，这种优势是否可持续以及在其他情况下的适用性需要进一步研究。",
