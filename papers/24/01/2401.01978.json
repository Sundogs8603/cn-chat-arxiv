    "abstract": "In the ever-changing and dynamic realm of high-end fashion marketplaces, providing accurate and personalized size recommendations has become a critical aspect. Meeting customer expectations in this regard is not only crucial for ensuring their satisfaction but also plays a pivotal role in driving customer retention, which is a key metric for the success of any fashion retailer. We propose a novel sequence classification approach to address this problem, integrating implicit (Add2Bag) and explicit (ReturnReason) user signals. Our approach comprises two distinct models: one employs LSTMs to encode the user signals, while the other leverages an Attention mechanism. Our best model outperforms SFNet, improving accuracy by 45.7%. By using Add2Bag interactions we increase the user coverage by 24.5% when compared with only using Orders. Moreover, we evaluate the models' usability in real-time recommendation scenarios by conducting experiments to measure their latency performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "在不断变化和动态的高端时尚市场中，提供准确和个性化的尺寸建议已成为一个关键方面。满足顾客在这方面的期望不仅对确保他们的满意度至关重要，也在促进顾客保持，这是任何时尚零售商成功的关键指标。我们提出了一种新的序列分类方法来解决这个问题，将隐式（加购物车）和显式（退货原因）用户信号进行整合。我们的方法包括两个不同的模型：一个采用LSTM对用户信号进行编码，另一个利用注意机制。我们的最佳模型的准确性比SFNet提高了45.7%。通过使用加购物车的交互，与仅使用订单相比，我们将用户覆盖范围增加了24.5%。此外，我们通过进行实验以测量模型的延迟性能，评估模型在实时推荐场景中的可用性。",
