    "abstract": "Automatic diacritization of Arabic text involves adding diacritical marks (diacritics) to the text. This task poses a significant challenge with noteworthy implications for computational processing and comprehension. In this paper, we introduce PTCAD (Pre-FineTuned Token Classification for Arabic Diacritization, a novel two-phase approach for the Arabic Text Diacritization task. PTCAD comprises a pre-finetuning phase and a finetuning phase, treating Arabic Text Diacritization as a token classification task for pre-trained models. The effectiveness of PTCAD is demonstrated through evaluations on two benchmark datasets derived from the Tashkeela dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results, including a 20\\% reduction in Word Error Rate (WER) compared to existing benchmarks and superior performance over GPT-4 in ATD tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "阿拉伯文本的自动音标化涉及向文本中添加音标符号。这一任务对于计算处理和理解具有重要意义。本文介绍了PTCAD（用于阿拉伯文本音标化的预先微调标记分类方法），这是一种针对阿拉伯文本音标化任务的全新两阶段方法。PTCAD包括预先微调阶段和微调阶段，将阿拉伯文本音标化视为针对预训练模型的标记分类任务。通过对来自Tashkeela数据集的两个基准数据集的评估，证明了PTCAD的有效性，在现有基准数据集上将词错误率（WER）减少了20％，并在ATD任务中表现优于GPT-4。",
