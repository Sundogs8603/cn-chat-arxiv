    "translated_abstract": "机器学习（ML），特别是随着大型语言模型（LLM）的出现，已经显著改变了各个行业。然而，从ML模型的原型设计到在软件系统中的实际应用，存在着许多挑战。这些挑战主要涉及确保安全性、保证可靠性和透明度，从而影响了ML模型的鲁棒性和可信度。本文介绍了一个名为ML-On-Rails的协议，旨在保护ML模型，并为不同的ML任务建立一个明确定义的端点接口，以促进ML提供者和ML消费者（软件工程师）之间的清晰沟通。ML-On-Rails通过添加检测能力来提高ML模型的鲁棒性，以识别与实际生产中的ML相关的特定挑战。我们通过对MoveReminder应用的实际案例研究来评估ML-On-Rails协议。通过这个评估，我们强调了在生产中保护ML模型的重要性。",
