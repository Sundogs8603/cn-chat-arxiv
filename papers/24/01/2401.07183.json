    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the optimal investment problem involving two agents, where the decision of one agent is influenced by the other. To measure the distance between two agents' decisions, we introduce the average deviation. We formulate the stochastic optimal control problem considering herd behavior and derive the analytical solution through the variational method. We theoretically analyze the impact of users' herd behavior on the optimal decision by decomposing it into their rational decisions, which is called the rational decision decomposition. Furthermore, to quantify the preference for their rational decision over that of the other agent, we introduce the agent's investment opinion. Our study is validated through simulations on real stock data.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了涉及两个代理的最优投资问题，其中一个代理的决策受到另一个代理的影响。为了衡量两个代理决策之间的差异程度，我们引入了平均偏差。我们通过变分方法推导出了考虑群体行为的随机最优控制问题的解析解。我们从理论上分析了用户群体行为对最优决策的影响，并将其分解成理性决策，这被称为理性决策分解。此外，为了量化代理对自己的理性决策相对于另一个代理的偏好程度，我们引入了代理的投资意见。通过对真实股票数据的模拟验证了我们的研究。",
