With our methodology, the manifold is learned as part of the training procedure, so ideal geometries may be discerned, while the evolution simultaneously induces a more accommodating latent representation over static methods.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于流形的自编码器方法，用于学习时间上的非线性动力学，尤其是偏微分方程（PDE），其中流形潜空间根据Ricci流发展。这可以通过在物理信息设置中模拟Ricci流来实现，并且可以匹配流形量，以便实现Ricci流。使用我们的方法，流形是作为训练过程的一部分学习的，因此可以识别出理想的几何形状，同时演变也能在静态方法上引起更宽容的潜在表示。我们在一系列数值实验中展示了我们的方法，包括具有周期性和随机性等理想特征的PDE，并在分布内和外推场景中进行误差评估。",

    "en_tdlr": "Ricci flow-guided autoencoder method is proposed to learn nonlinear dynamics, especially partial differential equations. The method learns the manifold as part of the training procedure and uses Ricci flow to make the latent space adapt to the dynamics. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the method in PDEs with periodic and random characteristics, with evaluations on both in-distribution and extrapolation scenarios."
