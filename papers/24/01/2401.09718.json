It presents the opportunity for machines to learn, adapt, and perform tasks that have the potential to assist people, from everyday activities to their most creative and ambitious projects. It could also help businesses and organizations harness knowledge, increase productivity, innovate, transform, and power shared prosperity. This tremendous potential raises two fundamental questions: (1) Will AI actually advance national and global economic transformation to benefit society at large? and (2) What issues must we get right to fully realize AI's economic value, expand prosperity and improve lives everywhere?

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能的最新进展标志着人类历史上的一个关键时刻。它提供了机器学习、适应和执行任务的机会，这些任务有潜力帮助人们从日常活动到最具创造性和雄心勃勃的项目。它还可以帮助企业和组织利用知识，提高生产力，创新，转型，并为共同繁荣提供动力。这个巨大的潜力引发了两个基本问题：（1）人工智能是否真的能够推动国家和全球经济转型，使社会受益？（2）我们必须解决哪些问题，才能充分实现人工智能的经济价值，扩大繁荣，改善世界各地的生活？我们通过考虑科技和创新的最近历史作为指导，探讨了这些问题。虽然我们并不认为未来会完全与过去相同，但我们将讨论一些原因。",
