    "translated_abstract": "超可靠低延迟通信（URLLC）是下一代无线网络中广泛范围的新兴服务的基石。URLLC基本上依赖于网络能够主动确定是否有足够的资源来支持URLLC流量，并因此防止所谓的小区过载。然而，为URLLC用户设备（UE）实现准确的服务质量（QoS）预测并防止小区超载是非常具有挑战性的任务。这是由于QoS指标（延迟和可靠性）依赖于流量和信道统计数据、用户的移动性和UE之间的相互依赖性。在本文中，开发了一种新的QoS感知UE接入控制方法，用于在将其与小区关联之前，主动估计URLLC UE的QoS，并相应地仅接纳不会导致小区过载的UE子集。为此，制定了一个优化问题来找到一种有效的UE接入控制策略，",
