    "translated_abstract": "众所周知，在问题回答中引入显式的知识图谱(KG)可以带来好处。现有的方法通常遵循一个基础推理流程，在该流程中，首先将实体节点与查询(问题和候选答案)进行关联，然后使用推理模块对匹配的多跳子图进行推理，用于预测答案。虽然这个流程在从庞大的KG中提取必要信息方面取得了很大的改善，但在放大关联的子图时，效率仍然面临挑战。本文旨在找到子图中的语义相关的实体节点，以提高使用KG进行图推理时的效率。我们提出了一个基于关联-修剪-推理的流程来修剪噪声节点，在显著降低计算和内存使用的同时，还能获得良好的子图表示。具体来说，修剪模块首先根据匹配范围之间的依赖距离对概念节点进行评分，然后对其进行修剪。",
