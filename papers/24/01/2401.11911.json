    "translated_abstract": "虽然辅助信息已经成为增强大型语言模型（LLMs）的关键，但对于LLMs如何合并生成的和检索的上下文仍知之甚少。为了研究这一点，我们制定了一个系统性的框架来确定LLMs的响应是源自于生成的上下文还是检索的上下文。为了实现这个目标，我们构建了包含相互冲突的上下文的数据集，其中每个问题都与生成的和检索的上下文配对，但只有一个上下文包含了正确的答案。我们的实验证明，LLMs（如GPT-4/3.5和Llama2）存在显著的偏差，更倾向于生成的上下文，即使这些上下文提供了错误的信息。我们进一步确定了导致这种偏差的两个关键因素：i）LLMs生成的上下文通常与问题更相似，增加了其被选择的可能性；ii）检索上下文中使用的分割过程打断了其连贯性。",
