    "abstract": "Based on bibliometric information from Scopus for the period 1996-2019, this document characterizes the evolution of Uruguayan scientific production and establishes the areas in which the country has a revealed comparative advantage (RCA). Methodologically, it is proposed that there is a RCA in an area if this area has a greater share in national scientific production than the share of the area in world scientific production. The evidence presented considers two measurements of scientific production (published articles and citations) and three levels of aggregation in the areas (a minor one with 5 large areas, a more detailed one with 27 disciplines and another even more granular with more than 300 disaggregations). Within Health Sciences there is a RCA in Veterinary, Nursing and Medicine. Within Life Sciences there is a RCA in Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Immunology and Microbiology and Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology. In Physical Sciences there is only a RCA in ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文基于1996年至2019年的Scopus文献信息，描述了乌拉圭科学生产的演变，并确定了国家在哪些领域具有比较优势。方法上，如果某个学科在国家科学产出中所占份额大于该学科在世界科学产出中的份额，则认为该领域具有比较优势。研究结果考虑了科学产出的两个指标（发表文章和引用次数），以及三个不同的领域划分层次（5个大领域、27个学科和300多个细分学科）。在健康科学领域，兽医、护理和医学具有比较优势。在生命科学领域，农业和生物科学、免疫学和微生物学以及生物化学、遗传学和分子生物学具有比较优势。在物理科学领域，只有一个领域具有比较优势。",
    "tldr": "本文基于Scopus的文献信息，研究了乌拉圭科学生产的特点，并确定了乌拉圭在各学科中的比较优势。乌拉圭在健康科学领域的兽医、护理和医学方面具有比较优势；在生命科学领域的农业和生物科学、免疫学和微生物学以及生物化学、遗传学和分子生物学方面具有比较优势；在物理科学领域只有一个领域具有比较优势。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study analyzes the characteristics of scientific production in Uruguay and identifies the areas where Uruguay has a comparative advantage. The study finds that Uruguay has a comparative advantage in veterinary, nursing, and medicine in the health sciences field, in agricultural and biological sciences, immunology and microbiology, and biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology in the life sciences field, and in one specific area in the physical sciences field."
