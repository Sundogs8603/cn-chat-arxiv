    "translated_abstract": "多智能体路径规划(MAPF)涉及确定多个智能体同时穿过共享区域前往特定目标位置的路径。这个问题在处理大量智能体时具有计算复杂性，尤其在像自动驾驶车辆协调这样的实际应用中。找到最优解通常是计算上不可行的，因此使用近似算法至关重要。同时，智能体可能以自私和策略性的方式行动，如果对MAPF算法有利，可能会歪曲其目标。虽然机制设计领域提供了用于对齐激励的工具，但如果不仔细考虑使用这些工具可能会在仅有近似最优结果时失败。由于近似对于可扩展的MAPF算法至关重要，这带来了重大挑战。在这项工作中，我们介绍了可扩展MAPF机制设计问题，并提出了三种对策。",
