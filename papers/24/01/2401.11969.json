    "abstract": "Automated fact-checking has drawn considerable attention over the past few decades due to the increase in the diffusion of misinformation on online platforms. This is often carried out as a sequence of tasks comprising (i) the detection of sentences circulating in online platforms which constitute claims needing verification, followed by (ii) the verification process of those claims. This survey focuses on the former, by discussing existing efforts towards detecting claims needing fact-checking, with a particular focus on multilingual data and methods. This is a challenging and fertile direction where existing methods are yet far from matching human performance due to the profoundly challenging nature of the issue.

    "translated_abstract": "自动事实核查在过去几十年中引起了相当大的关注，原因是网络平台上虚假信息的传播增加了。这通常是作为一系列任务的序列来完成的，包括（i）检测在网上流传的句子，这些句子构成需要验证的索赔，然后是（ii）对这些索赔进行验证的过程。本综述重点讨论前者，讨论了现有的努力，旨在检测需要事实核查的索赔，特别关注多语言数据和方法。这是一个具有挑战性和富有成果的方向，由于问题的极其具有挑战性，在人类表现方面，现有方法离匹配人类表现还有很长的路要走。特别是，跨多个社交平台的信息传播以多种语言和模态表达，需要更加通用的解决方案来对抗不实信息。我们针对多语言不实信息，提供了一份全面的综述。",
