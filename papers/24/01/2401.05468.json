    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new problem in the field of graph mining and social network analysis called new node prediction. More technically, the task can be categorized as zero-shot out-of-graph all-links prediction. This challenging problem aims to predict all links from a new, isolated, and unobserved node that was previously disconnected from the graph. Unlike classic approaches to link prediction (including few-shot out-of-graph link prediction), this problem presents two key differences: (1) the new node has no existing links from which to extract patterns for new predictions; and (2) the goal is to predict not just one, but all the links of this new node, or at least a significant part of them. Experiments demonstrate that an architecture based on Deep Graph Neural Networks can learn to solve this challenging problem in a bibliographic citation network.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了图挖掘和社交网络分析领域中的一个新问题，即新节点预测。从技术上讲，这个任务可被归类为零样本的图外所有连接预测。这个具有挑战性的问题旨在预测一个先前与图不相连、孤立且未观测到的新节点的所有连接。与经典的连接预测方法（包括少样本的图外连接预测）不同，这个问题有两个关键的不同之处：（1）新节点没有现有的连接可供提取模式用于新的预测；（2）目标是预测不仅仅是一个，而是这个新节点的所有连接，或者至少其中的一个显著部分。实验表明，基于深度图神经网络的架构可以学习解决这个具有挑战性的问题在一个文献引用网络中。",
