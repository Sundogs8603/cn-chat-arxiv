    "abstract": "This article extends, in a stochastic setting, previous results in the determination of feasible exchange ratios for merging companies. A first outcome is that shareholders of the companies involved in the merging process face both an upper and a lower bounds for acceptable exchange ratios. Secondly, in order for the improved `bargaining region' to be intelligibly displayed, the diagrammatic approach developed by Kulpa is exploited.",
