    "translated_abstract": "加速电动汽车过渡需要强有力的政策和可持续激励措施。本文评估了五个欧洲国家近期政策发展中的各种费用激励设计。虽然有关键设计元素需要考虑，但并不存在最佳的费用激励设计。费用激励设计和效果可能会受到不同政策目标的影响。使用费用激励过渡到电动汽车已成为一个重要目标。随着电动车激励计划的财务可持续性受到质疑，自我融资的市场机制可能是一个当务之急的解决方案。无论政策目标如何，费用激励都将影响供给方（汽车工业）和需求方（消费者）。在全球范围内，费用激励可以用于推动技术跨越发展，并在不同国家背景下应对清洁交通政策的政治经济。本文突出了一个有效的费用激励政策的十三个设计要素。",
