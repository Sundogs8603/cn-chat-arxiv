    "translated_abstract": "磷去除对于废水处理至关重要，以减少对有限资源的依赖。深度强化学习是一种可以通过试错来学习控制策略的机器学习技术，可以优化复杂和非线性的系统，包括废水处理厂的处理过程。然而，将深度强化学习应用于化学和生物过程是具有挑战性的，因为需要准确的模拟器。本研究训练了六个模型来识别磷去除过程，并使用它们创建了一个用于深度强化学习环境的模拟器。虽然模型的准确性很高（>97%），但不确定性和错误预测行为限制了它们作为模拟器在更长时间范围内的性能。模型预测误差的累积被确定为这个问题的原因之一。这种改进过程控制的方法涉及为深度强化学习算法创建模拟环境，使用监控与数据采集系统（SCADA）数据。",
