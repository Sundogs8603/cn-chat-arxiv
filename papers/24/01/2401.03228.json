    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型已经成为实际应用中大规模生成模型的首选方法。这些应用通常涉及在有界域内限制的数据分布，通常需要 ad-hoc 阈值技术来强制边界。反射扩散模型旨在通过由反射布朗运动控制的后向过程生成数据分布，以增加泛化能力。然而，反射扩散模型可能不容易适应各种领域，需要正确导出的差同胚映射，并且不能保证最优输运特性。为了克服这些限制，我们引入了反射Schr\\\"odinger桥算法：一种用于在各种有界域内生成数据的熵正则化最优输运方法。我们推导了带有 Neumann 和 Robin 边界条件的优雅反射正向-反向随机微分方程，并将基于散度的似然训练扩展到有界领域。",
