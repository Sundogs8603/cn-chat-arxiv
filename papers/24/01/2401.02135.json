    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型需要大量干净的数据才能达到良好的性能。为了避免昂贵的数据获取成本，研究人员使用互联网上丰富的数据。这引发了关于在未经授权的情况下滥用个人数据用于模型训练的重大隐私问题。最近的研究如CUDA提出了解决这个问题的方法，即通过添加按类别模糊处理来使数据集无法学习，即模型永远无法使用已获取的数据集进行学习。然而，这些方法往往会降低数据的质量，使其对实际应用无用。我们引入了PosCUDA，一种用于创建无法学习的音频数据集的位置卷积。PosCUDA在小音频块上使用按类别的卷积。块的位置基于每个类别的私钥，因此模型可以学习位置模糊和标签之间的关系，同时无法泛化。我们通过实验证明了PosCUDA可以实现无法学习性能，同时维持音频数据的质量。",
