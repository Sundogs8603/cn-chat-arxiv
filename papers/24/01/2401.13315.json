    "translated_abstract": "为了应对结直肠癌（CRC）日益增长的患病率，息肉检测和切除的筛查计划已经证明了它们的有效性。结肠镜被认为是CRC筛查的最佳方法。为了简化检查过程，已经开发了基于深度学习的自动息肉检测方法，适用于传统的白光成像（WLI）。与WLI相比，窄带成像（NBI）在结肠镜检查过程中可以改善息肉分类，但需要特殊设备。我们提出了一种基于CycleGAN的框架，将使用常规WLI捕获的图像转化为合成NBI（SNBI），作为在没有NBI时改进WLI上的目标检测的预处理方法。本文首先展示了与相对相似的WLI数据集相比，NBI上可以取得更好的息肉检测结果。其次，实验结果表明，从WLI生成的SNBI图像上进行的我们提出的模态转换可以实现比原始WLI上更好的息肉检测效果。",
