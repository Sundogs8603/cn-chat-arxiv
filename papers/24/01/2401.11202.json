We present PartIR, our design for a NN partitioning system. PartIR is focused on an incremental approach to rewriting and is hardware-and-runtime agnostic. We present a simple but powerful API for composing sharding strategies and a simulator to validate them. The process is driven by high-level programmer-issued partitioning tactics, which can be both manual and automatic. Importantly, the tactics are specified separately from the model code, making them easy to change. We evaluate PartIR on several different models to demonstrate its predictability, expressibility, and ability to reach peak performance..",

    "translated_abstract": "现代大规模神经网络（NN）的训练需要结合数据、模型或优化器分片的并行化策略。当策略变得复杂时，分区工具需要具备以下特点：1）表达力强，允许组合简单策略；2）可预测性强，可以通过分析估算性能。我们提出了PartIR，一种用于NN分区的设计。PartIR采用增量重写方法，与硬件和运行时无关。我们提供了一个简单而强大的API用于组合分片策略，并提供了一个模拟器进行验证。整个过程由高级程序员发出的分区策略驱动，既可以手动也可以自动。重要的是，这些策略与模型代码分开指定，易于更改。我们通过对几种不同模型的评估来展示PartIR的可预测性、表达能力和达到峰值性能的能力。",

It is driven by partitioning strategies issued by high-level programmers and uses an incremental approach to combine different sharding strategies. Evaluation shows that PartIR is highly predictable, expressive, and capable of achieving peak performance."
