    "abstract": "As a quantitative characterization of the complicated economy, Macroeconomic Variables (MEVs), including GDP, inflation, unemployment, income, spending, interest rate, etc., are playing a crucial role in banks' portfolio management and stress testing exercise. In recent years, especially during the COVID-19 period and the current high inflation environment, people are frequently talking about the changing \"correlation structure\" of MEVs. In this paper, we use a principal component based algorithm to better understand MEVs' correlation structure in a given period. We also demonstrate how this method can be used to visualize historical MEVs pattern changes between 2000 and 2022. Further, we use this method to compare different hypothetical or historical macroeconomic scenarios and present our key findings.",

    "translated_abstract": "作为对复杂经济的量化描述，宏观经济变量（MEVs），包括GDP、通胀率、失业率、收入、支出、利率等，在银行的投资组合管理和压力测试中起着关键作用。近年来，特别是在COVID-19期间和当前高通胀环境下，人们经常谈论MEVs的“相关结构”如何变化。本文使用一种基于主成分的算法来更好地理解给定时期内MEVs的相关结构。我们还展示了如何使用此方法来可视化2000年至2022年间历史上MEVs模式的变化。此外，我们使用该方法比较了不同的假设或历史宏观经济场景，并呈现了我们的主要发现。",
