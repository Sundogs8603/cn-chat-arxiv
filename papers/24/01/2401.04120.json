    "translated_abstract": "生成人工智能（AI）聊天机器人的普及，如ChatGPT，对社交媒体产生了深远影响。随着AI生成内容的普及，人们对在线隐私和虚假信息的担忧也越来越多。在社交媒体平台中，Discord允许AI集成，使他们以\"Z世代\"为主的用户群体特别容易接触到AI生成的内容。我们对年龄为Z世代的个体（n = 335）进行了调查，以评估他们在Discord上区分AI生成和人类撰写文本的能力。调查采用了ChatGPT伪装成在Discord.com平台上收到的一条短信的单次提示。我们探讨了人口统计因素和参与者对Discord和人工智能技术的熟悉程度对能力的影响。我们发现Z世代个体无法区分AI和人类撰写的文本（p = 0.011），那些自我报告程度较低的个体能力更差。",
