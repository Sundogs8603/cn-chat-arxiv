    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLM)在理解和生成与人类交流紧密相似的文本方面展现出了非凡的能力。然而，其主要限制在于训练过程中的显著计算需求，这是由于其广泛的参数化造成的。这一挑战在于世界的动态性，需要频繁更新LLM以修正过时的信息或集成新知识，从而确保其持续的相关性。许多应用需要在训练后进行持续的模型调整，以解决缺陷或不良行为。近年来，对于LLM的知识编辑技术的兴趣越来越高，在特定领域内有效地修改LLM的行为，同时保持整体性能在各种输入中的表现。本文首先定义了知识编辑的目标和挑战，然后综述了现有的知识编辑方法和技术，并讨论了其应用和未来发展的方向。",
