We first identify the overoptimization problem during QE-based feedback training, manifested as an increase in reward while translation quality declines. We examine the problem and argue that the vulnerability of the QE model might lead to high rewards for incorrect translations, resulting in overoptimization and error propagation.

    "translated_abstract": "不充分建模人类偏好导致奖励模型在利用人的反馈提高翻译质量方面成为一个主要障碍。幸运的是，质量估计(QE)在过去两年中无需参考文献就能准确预测给定翻译的质量。在这项工作中，我们探讨了将QE模型作为奖励模型(基于QE的奖励模型)来预测人的偏好以进行反馈训练的潜力。我们首先发现了在基于QE的反馈训练中的过度优化问题，表现为奖励的增加而翻译质量下降。我们研究了这个问题，并认为QE模型的脆弱性可能导致错误翻译的高奖励，从而导致过度优化和错误传播。为解决这个问题，我们采用了一种简单而有效的方法，使用启发式规则检测错误翻译，并为QE模型添加了一个惩罚项。",
