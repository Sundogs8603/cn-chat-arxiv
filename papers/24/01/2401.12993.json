    "translated_abstract": "分析作者在文本中的情感作为一种识别文本极性的技术，在医学和牙科等各个领域中都可以很实用和有用。目前，由于患者对自身状况了解有限、难以接触专科医生或者对疾病的恐惧，尤其是在大流行病条件下，接收放射学报告和咨询医生之间可能存在延迟。在某些情况下，这种延迟可能对患者带来重大风险，因此及时决策至关重要。通过分析放射学报告的文本，自动系统可以通知患者其病情恶化程度，这在及时决策方面将产生巨大影响。本研究收集了来自Shiraz大学医学科学院的1,134份锥束计算机断层摄影（CBCT）照片报告数据集。每个案例都经过检查，由专家对每个文档上的患者状况标注了严重程度。",
