    "translated_abstract": "常见的解释是内容推荐系统对用户产生负面影响是由于平台目标与用户福利之间的不对齐。在这项工作中，我们展示了平台目标不一致并不是对用户产生意外影响的唯一潜在原因：即使平台目标完全与用户福利一致，学习算法也可能对用户产生负面影响。这些用户影响的来源是不同内容可能以不同的速率产生可观察的用户反应（反馈信息）；这些反馈速率可能与影响用户体验的内容属性（如争议性或创作者的人口相似度）相关。由于反馈速率的差异可能会影响学习算法与不同内容的交互频率，学习算法可能会无意中推广具有某些特定属性的内容。使用多臂赌博机框架与概率反馈，我们提出了一种新的方法来解决这一问题。",

    "en_tdlr": "This work explores the potential negative user impacts of content recommender systems and highlights that these impacts can arise not only from misalignment between the platform's objective and user welfare, but also from differences in feedback rates for different content. A novel approach using the multi-armed bandit framework and probabilistic feedback is proposed to address this issue."
