    "translated_abstract": "为了克服低成本热线风速计由于气温变化而导致的精度损失，本研究旨在利用高斯过程回归进行概率校准。高斯过程回归是一种非参数的贝叶斯和监督学习方法，旨在根据一个或多个已知的输入变量预测未知的目标变量。我们的方法在真实数据集上进行验证，在推断实际风速值方面表现良好。通过在实际使用前，对热线风速计进行考虑气温的校准，可以估计典型环境温度范围内的风速，并且为每个速度测量值提供可靠的不确定性估计。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study addresses the issue of accuracy loss in low-cost hot-wire anemometers caused by changes in air temperature. It proposes a probabilistic calibration using Gaussian Process Regression, which achieves good performance in inferring actual wind speed values. By calibrating the anemometer with temperature considerations before use, it allows for estimation of wind speed in typical ambient temperatures and provides reliable uncertainty estimates for each measurement."
