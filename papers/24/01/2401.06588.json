    "abstract": "This paper describes the use of connectionist techniques in phonetic speech recognition with strong latency constraints. The constraints are imposed by the task of deriving the lip movements of a synthetic face in real time from the speech signal, by feeding the phonetic string into an articulatory synthesiser. Particular attention has been paid to analysing the interaction between the time evolution model learnt by the multi-layer perceptrons and the transition model imposed by the Viterbi decoder, in different latency conditions. Two experiments were conducted in which the time dependencies in the language model (LM) were controlled by a parameter. The results show a strong interaction between the three factors involved, namely the neural network topology, the length of time dependencies in the LM and the decoder latency.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文描述了在强延迟约束条件下使用连接主义技术进行语音识别的情况。这些约束是通过将语音信号输入到口腔运动合成器中，从而实时推导出合成面部的唇部运动来实现的。我们特别关注了多层感知器学习的时间演化模型与维特比译码器强制的转移模型在不同延迟条件下的相互作用。进行了两个实验，通过参数控制了语言模型中的时间依赖关系。结果显示了神经网络拓扑结构、语言模型中时间依赖的长度和解码器延迟之间的强烈相互作用。",
