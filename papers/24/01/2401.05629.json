    "translated_abstract": "控制障碍函数（CBFs）提供了一个优雅的框架，通过将非线性控制系统的轨迹约束在预定义安全集合的不变子集上，设计安全过滤器。然而，找到一个同时在最大化控制不变集体积和适应复杂安全约束方面具有挑战性的CBF，尤其是在具有执行约束的高相对度的系统中，仍然是一个问题。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新颖的自监督学习框架，全面解决了这些障碍。给定定义安全集合的多个状态约束的布尔组合，我们的方法从构建一个单一的可导函数开始，其0超级级别集合提供了安全集合的内部近似。然后，我们使用这个函数以及一个平滑的神经网络来参数化CBF候选。最后，我们设计了基于哈密顿-雅可比的训练损失函数。",
