    "translated_abstract": "过去关于机器人规划与时间逻辑规范的研究，特别是线性时间逻辑（LTL），主要是基于针对个体或群体机器人的单一公式。但随着任务复杂性的增加，LTL公式不可避免地变得冗长，使解释和规范生成变得复杂，同时还对规划器的计算能力造成压力。通过利用任务的内在结构，我们引入了一种层次化结构到具有语法和语义需求的LTL规范中，并证明它们比扁平规范更具表达能力。其次，我们采用基于搜索的方法来综合多机器人系统的计划，实现同时的任务分配和规划。搜索空间由松散相互连接的子空间近似表示，每个子空间对应一个LTL规范。搜索主要受限于单个子空间，根据特定条件转移到另一个子空间。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper introduces a method for simultaneous task allocation and planning in multi-robot systems using hierarchical temporal logic specifications. By leveraging the hierarchical structure in the LTL specifications, this approach achieves higher expressiveness. A search-based approach is employed to synthesize plans for the system, dividing the search space into loosely interconnected sub-spaces for more efficient task allocation and planning."
