    "abstract": "Purpose: Understanding the formation of entrepreneurial intentions is critical, given that it is the first step in the entrepreneurial process. Although entrepreneurial intention has been extensively studied, little attention has been paid on the intended timing of future entrepreneurial projects. This paper analyses entrepreneurial intentions among final-year university students after graduation in terms of the timeframe to start a business. Potentially rapid entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs-in-waiting were compared using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Methodology: A variance-based structural equation modelling approach was used for the sample of 851 final-year university students with entrepreneurial intentions who participated in GUESSS project. Findings: The results obtained contribute to the understanding of how entrepreneurial intentions are formed, particularly, how intended timing plays a moderating role in the relationships of the variables of the theoretical model of T",

    "translated_abstract": "目的：理解创业意图的形成是至关重要的，因为这是创业过程的第一步。尽管创业意图已经得到广泛研究，但对未来创业项目的预期时间选择关注甚少。本文分析了毕业后准备创业的大学最后一年学生的创业意图，重点关注创业启动的时间框架。通过计划行为理论（TPB）比较了可能快速创业者和观望创业者。方法：采用基于方差的结构方程建模方法，对851名准备创业的大学最后一年学生进行了GUESSS项目的样本分析。结果：所得结果有助于理解创业意图的形成过程，特别是预期时间选择在理论模型变量关系中的调节作用。",
