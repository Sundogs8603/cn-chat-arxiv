    "translated_abstract": "在快速发展的机器学习领域中，对抗攻击对模型的健壮性和安全性提出了显著挑战。决策型攻击只需要模型的决策反馈，而不需要详细的概率或分数，因此特别难以防御。本研究引入了L-AutoDA（基于大型语言模型自动生成决策型对抗攻击）的创新方法，利用大型语言模型的生成能力自动设计这些攻击。通过在进化框架中与大型语言模型进行迭代交互，L-AutoDA能够高效地自动设计出竞争性的攻击算法，减少人工工作量。我们在CIFAR-10数据集上展示了L-AutoDA的有效性，显示出在成功率和计算效率方面相比基准方法的显著改进。我们的研究结果突显了语言模型作为对抗攻击生成工具的潜力。",
