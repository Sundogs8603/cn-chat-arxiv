    "abstract": "Spectrum sharing allows different protocols of the same standard (e.g., 802.11 family) or different standards (e.g., LTE and DVB) to coexist in overlapping frequency bands. As this paradigm continues to spread, wireless systems must also evolve to identify active transmitters and unauthorized waveforms in real time under intentional distortion of preambles, extremely low signal-to-noise ratios and challenging channel conditions. We overcome limitations of correlation-based preamble matching methods in such conditions through the design of T-PRIME: a Transformer-based machine learning approach. T-PRIME learns the structural design of transmitted frames through its attention mechanism, looking at sequence patterns that go beyond the preamble alone. The paper makes three contributions: First, it compares Transformer models and demonstrates their superiority over traditional methods and state-of-the-art neural networks. Second, it rigorously analyzes T-PRIME's real-time feasibility on Deep",

    "translated_abstract": "频谱共享允许相同标准（例如802.11系列）或不同标准（例如LTE和DVB）的不同协议在重叠的频段中共存。随着这种范式的推广，无线系统必须在故意损坏前导码、极低信噪比和挑战性的信道条件下实时识别活动发射器和未经授权的波形。通过设计T-PRIME：一种基于Transformer的机器学习方法，我们克服了在这种情况下基于相关性的前导码匹配方法的局限性。T-PRIME通过其注意机制学习传输帧的结构设计，查看超出前导码的序列模式。本文提出了三个贡献：首先，对比Transformer模型并证明其优于传统方法和最先进的神经网络。其次，严格分析了T-PRIME在深度学习硬件限制下的实时可行性。",
