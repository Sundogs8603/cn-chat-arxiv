    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）使多个数据所有者（即FL客户端）能够在不泄露敏感私人数据的情况下共同训练机器学习模型。现有的FL研究主要关注垄断场景，在该场景中，单个FL服务器在每轮训练中选择一部分FL客户端来更新其本地模型。实际上，可能会有多个FL服务器同时尝试从同一个池中选择客户端。本文提出了一种首创的公平感知联邦作业调度（FairFedJS）方法来弥合这一差距。基于Lyapunov优化，它通过同时考虑当前需求和作业付款出价，确保将高需求的FL客户端数据集公平分配给需要它们的FL作业，以防止等待时间过长。基于两个数据集对FairFedJS与四种最先进的方法进行了大量实验证明了其显著优势。它在平均上击败了最佳基准线31.9%和1.0%。",
