The scheme is explicit in time and uses neural network least-squares and quantile regressions for the embedded conditional expectations and expected shortfall computations. An a posteriori Monte Carlo validation procedure allows assessing the regression error of the scheme at each time step. The superiority of this scheme with respect to Picard iterations is illustrated in a high-dimensional and hybrid market/default risks XVA use-case.",
