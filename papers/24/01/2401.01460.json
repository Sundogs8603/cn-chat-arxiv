    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一个名为深度集合线性化最优传输的算法，旨在将点云高效地嵌入到L2空间中。这种嵌入在保留Wasserstein空间中特定低维结构的同时，构建了一个能够区分不同类别点云的分类器。我们的方法基于以下观察，即不同点云的最优传输映射之间的L2距离（源自共享的固定参考分布）在某些假设下近似表示这些点云之间的Wasserstein-2距离。为了学习这些传输映射的近似，我们采用输入凸神经网络（ICNNs），并且证明在特定条件下，这些ICNNs的样本之间的欧氏距离与真实分布之间的Wasserstein-2距离非常相似。此外，我们训练了一个鉴别器网络，对这些样本进行加权，并创建了一个置换不变的模型。",
