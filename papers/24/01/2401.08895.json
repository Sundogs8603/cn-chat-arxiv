    "translated_abstract": "输入数据管道是每个机器学习（ML）训练任务的重要组成部分。它负责读取大量的训练数据，使用复杂的变换处理样本批次，并以低延迟和高吞吐量将其加载到训练节点上。高性能的输入数据系统变得越来越关键，原因是数据量急剧增加和训练吞吐量的要求。然而，当前的输入数据系统无法充分利用关键的性能优化，导致资源利用效率极低的基础设施，或者更糟糕地，浪费昂贵的加速器。为了满足这些需求，我们提出了cedar，一个编程模型和框架，允许用户轻松构建、优化和执行输入数据管道。cedar提供了易于使用的编程接口，允许用户使用可组合运算符来定义支持任意ML框架和库的输入数据管道。",
