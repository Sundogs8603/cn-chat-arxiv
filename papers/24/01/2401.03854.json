    "translated_abstract": "最近，AI生成图像质量评估（AIGCIQA）作为计算机视觉中的一个新课题出现，旨在从人类感知角度评估AI生成的图像（AIGI）的质量。与常见的图像质量评估任务不同，这些任务中的图像是通过生成模型使用文本提示生成的，而不是通过噪声、模糊和压缩等方式从原始图像中导出。过去几年里，已经做了大量努力来推进AIGCIQA。然而，大多数现有的AIGCIQA方法直接从单个生成的图像回归预测得分，忽视了这些图像的文本提示中包含的信息。这种疏忽部分限制了这些AIGCIQA方法的性能。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于文本图像编码器的回归（TIER）框架。具体而言，我们将生成的图像及其对应的文本提示作为输入，利用一个文本编码器和一个图像编码器来处理这些输入。通过将文本和图像嵌入到同一个特征空间中，我们实现了综合利用文本和图像特征的AIGCIQA方法。",
