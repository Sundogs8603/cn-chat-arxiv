    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型为图像生成领域打开了新的道路，导致了在开源平台上共享高质量模型的广泛传播。然而，目前的文本生成图像系统存在一个主要挑战，即往往无法处理多样化的输入，或仅限于单一模型的结果。目前的统一尝试通常分为两个正交方面：i）在输入阶段解析多样的提示；ii）激活专家模型进行输出。为了兼顾两者的优点，我们提出了DiffusionGPT，它利用大型语言模型（LLM）提供了一个统一的生成系统，能够无缝地适应各种类型的提示并整合领域专家模型。DiffusionGPT基于先验知识为各种生成模型构建了领域特定的Thought树。当提供输入时，LLM解析提示并利用Thought树来指导选择适当的模型，从而放松输入约束并确保异常的效果。",
