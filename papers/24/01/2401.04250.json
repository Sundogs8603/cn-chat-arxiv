    "translated_abstract": "拓扑数据分析（TDA）因其能够捕捉数据中复杂的形状和结构而受到研究人员的赞誉。TDA被认为可以处理噪声和高维数据集，并且其可解释性被认为有助于直观理解模型行为。然而，有关TDA的能力和使用价值的声明仅在将基于TDA的模型与其他图机器学习方法（如图神经网络）进行比较的应用领域中部分地得到测试。我们通过一系列细致的实验对TDA的声明进行了全面检验，并验证了其优点。我们的结果证实了TDA对离群点的鲁棒性和可解释性，与支持者的观点一致。然而，我们发现在我们的特定实验中，TDA并没有显著提高现有方法的预测能力，同时还带来了显著的计算成本。我们研究了与图特性相关的现象，例如小尺度世界的存在。",
