    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了Climinator，一种新颖的基于人工智能的工具，用于自动化核查气候变化声明的事实。Climinator利用大量的大型语言模型（LLMs），并以IPCC报告和同行评审的科学文献等权威来源为基础，采用了一种创新的调解者-倡导者框架。该设计使Climinator能够有效地综合不同的科学观点，从而得出稳健的、基于证据的评估结果。我们的模型在从Climate Feedback和Skeptical Science收集的声明进行测试时表现出了显著的准确性。值得注意的是，在我们的框架中结合具有气候科学否定观点的倡导者时，Climinator的迭代辩论过程可靠地趋向于科学共识，突显了它在将不同观点协调为基于科学、事实性结论方面的能力。虽然我们的研究存在一定的限制，并需要谨慎解释，但我们的方法具有重要潜力。",
