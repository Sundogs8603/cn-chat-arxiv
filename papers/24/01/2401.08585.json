    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们提出了一个新的建模框架，使用概念空间的范畴论推广来建立结构化概念，并展示了如何通过两种非常不同的实例（经典和量子）自动地从数据中学习概念表示。该工作的一个贡献是对我们框架进行了彻底的范畴论形式化。我们声称范畴论的使用，特别是使用弦图来描述量子过程，有助于阐明我们方法的一些最重要的特点。我们建立在Gardenfors的概念空间的经典框架之上，该框架通过使用凸空间几何地建模认知，并通过称为域的简单空间分解。我们展示了如何从简单形状的图像中学习形状、颜色、大小和位置等域的概念，其中概念在经典实现中被表示为高斯分布，而在量子实现中被表示为量子态。",
