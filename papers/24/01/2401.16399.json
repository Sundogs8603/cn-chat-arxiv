We show that our approach is superior both to using classical cloneproof voting rules and to running primaries within alliances before the election.  We introduce several alliance-aware voting rules and show that they satisfy the most desirable standard properties of their classical counterparts as well as newly introduced axioms for the model with alliances which, e.g., exclude the possibility of the spoiler effect.

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了具有序数偏好的单一选举中的一个设置，其中候选人可能是\\emph{联盟}的成员（可以对应政党、派别或联盟）。然而，我们不假设同一联盟的候选人在选民排名中一定相邻。在这种情况下，每个经典的选举规则都容易受到破坏者效应的影响，即某个候选人的存在可能会损害他或她的联盟。因此，我们引入了一种新的\\emph{联盟感知}选举规则的想法，扩展了经典的选举规则。我们展示了我们的方法既优于使用经典的克隆免疫选举规则，也优于在选举前在联盟内进行初选。我们引入了几个联盟感知的选举规则，并展示它们满足经典对应规则的大多数理想标准，以及在具有联盟模型的情况下引入的新公理，例如，排除了破坏者效应的可能性。我们的规则具有...",
