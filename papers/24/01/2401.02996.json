    "translated_abstract": "利用人工智能进行基于咳嗽的呼吸系统疾病诊断引起了很大关注，但许多现有研究忽视了其预测模型中的混淆变量。这些变量可能会扭曲咳嗽记录（输入数据）和呼吸系统疾病状态（输出变量）之间的关系，导致有偏倚的关联和不真实的模型性能。为填补这一缺口，我们提出了无偏倚网络（RBFNet），这是一个端到端的解决方案，能够有效地减轻训练数据分布中混淆因素的影响。RBFNet确保了准确且无偏倚的呼吸系统疾病诊断特征，并通过将COVID-19数据集纳入本研究来强调其相关性。该方法旨在通过克服混淆因素带来的挑战，提高基于人工智能的呼吸系统疾病诊断模型的可靠性。提出了RBFNet的特征编码器模块的卷积神经网络（CNN）和长短期记忆（LSTM）网络的混合模型。",
