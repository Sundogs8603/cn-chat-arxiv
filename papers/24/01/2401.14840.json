    "translated_abstract": "机器学习（ML）已成为数据科学中最具变革性和影响力的领域之一。然而，ML的广泛应用引入了隐私相关的担忧，因为恶意攻击针对ML模型的数量不断增加。为了解决这些问题，引入了隐私保护机器学习（PPML）方法来保护ML模型的隐私和安全。其中一种方法是使用同态加密（HE）。然而，传统HE的显著缺点和低效性使其在高度可扩展的场景中不实用。幸运的是，最近出现了一种现代密码方案，混合同态加密（HHE），它结合了对称密码和HE的优点，克服了这些挑战。我们的工作旨在通过设计一种针对终端设备的PPML方案来引入HHE到ML中。我们利用HHE作为基本构建块，实现对加密数据上的分类结果的安全学习，同时保证高效扩展性。",
