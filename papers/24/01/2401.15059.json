    "translated_abstract": "多智能体强化学习（MARL）是多智能体系统领域的一个广泛研究领域。最近的一些工作专注于研究MARL中的通信方法。虽然已经提出了多种通信方法，但这些方法可能仍然过于复杂，不容易迁移到更实际的情境中。其中一个原因是使用了著名的参数共享技巧。在本文中，我们研究了在MARL中不共享参数的独立学习者如何进行通信。我们证明了这种设置可能会带来一些问题，为此我们提出了一种新的学习方案作为解决方案。我们的结果表明，尽管面临挑战，独立的智能体仍然可以通过我们的方法学习通信策略。此外，我们使用这种方法来研究MARL中的通信如何受到不同网络容量的影响，无论是共享参数还是不共享参数。我们观察到，通信的能力在这两种情况下都产生了影响。",

The results demonstrate that despite the challenges, independent agents can still effectively communicate using the proposed method. The paper also explores the impact of communication under different network capacities."
