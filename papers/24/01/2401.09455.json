    "translated_abstract": "集成卫星-地面网络（ISTN）系统经历了显著增长，为偏远地区提供了无缝通信服务，解决了有限的地面基础设施问题。然而，为ISTN设计路由方案极具挑战性，主要是由于增加了地面站的复杂性，并要求满足与卫星服务质量有关的各种约束条件。为解决这些挑战，我们研究了与地面站和卫星共同传输数据包的路由，同时优先考虑快速通信、满足能源效率和数据包丢失要求。具体而言，我们使用拉格朗日方法将带约束的数据包路由问题制定为一个最大最小化问题。然后，我们提出了一种名为CMADR的新颖约束多智能体强化学习（MARL）动态路由算法，它有效地平衡目标改善和约束满足。",
