    "translated_abstract": "通信是协调多个智能体行为的一种有效机制。然而，现有的研究主要集中在广播通信上，这不仅缺乏实用性，而且还导致信息冗余。这种一刀切的信息可能对通信效率产生不利影响。此外，现有的研究常常采用基础机制来整合观察到的和接收到的信息，从而影响学习过程。为了解决这些困难，我们提出了一种名为T2MAC的目标和可信的多智能体通信方法，这是一种简单而有效的方法，使智能体能够学习选择性参与和基于证据的整合。通过T2MAC，智能体能够制定个性化消息，确定理想的通信窗口，并与可靠的伙伴进行互动，从而提高通信效率。在接收消息后，智能体可以从不同来源观察和接收的信息进行整合。",
