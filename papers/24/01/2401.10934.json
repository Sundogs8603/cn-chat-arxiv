    "translated_abstract": "在在线广告的场景中，销售商通常会创建多个创意以提供全面的演示，因此呈现出最吸引人的设计以最大化点击率（CTR）至关重要。然而，销售商通常难以考虑用户对创意设计的偏好，导致相对于基于人工智能（AI）的方法来说，美学和数量都较低。传统的基于AI的方法仍然面临同样的问题，即没有考虑用户信息，同时在设计师的美学知识方面有限。事实上，通过融合用户信息，生成的创意可能更具吸引力，因为不同的用户可能有不同的偏好。为了优化结果，传统方法中生成的创意会通过另一个被称为创意排名模型的模块进行排序。排名模型可以考虑用户特征来预测每个创意的CTR分数。然而，上述的两个阶段被视为两个不同的训练任务，使得生成的创意可能不够精准。",
