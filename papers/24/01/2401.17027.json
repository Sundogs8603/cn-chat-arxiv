    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型在治疗效果估计方面已经显示出有希望的结果。然而，大多数模型忽视了不同特征亚群之间的治疗结果变化。这个限制阻碍了它们提供准确估计和特定亚群的治疗建议的能力。在这项研究中，我们引入了一种新颖的基于神经网络的框架，名为SubgroupTE，它结合了亚群识别和治疗效果估计。SubgroupTE对各个亚群进行识别并同时估计每个亚群的治疗效果，通过考虑治疗反应的异质性改进了治疗效果估计。对合成数据的比较实验表明，SubgroupTE在治疗效果估计方面优于现有模型。此外，对与阿片类药物使用障碍（OUD）相关的真实数据集的实验证明了我们方法提高个性化治疗建议的潜力。",
