    "translated_abstract": "在医学领域，视觉问答（VQA）面临着一个独特的、跨学科的挑战，结合了计算机视觉、自然语言处理和知识表示等领域。尽管其重要性，医学VQA的研究一直很少，直到2018年才开始蓬勃发展。我们的研究填补了这一空白，深入探讨了放射学图像的有效表示以及多模态表示的联合学习，超越了现有的方法。我们创新地增强了SLAKE数据集，使我们的模型能够回答更多样化的问题，不仅限于放射学或病理学图像的内容。我们的模型在更简单的架构下实现了79.55％的top-1准确率，展示了与当前最先进模型相当的性能。这项研究不仅推动了医学VQA的发展，也为诊断设置中的实际应用开辟了道路。",
