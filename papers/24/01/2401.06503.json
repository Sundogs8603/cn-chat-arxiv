    "translated_abstract": "由于其尺寸和方向，大规模航空图像中代表较小像素区域的小型有方向物体很难检测。现有的有方向航空检测器已经取得了有希望的结果，但主要关注物体的方向建模，对物体的尺寸关注较少。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种方法，通过增强有方向物体检测模型的分类和回归任务，准确地检测航空图像中的小型有方向物体。我们设计了Attention-Points网络，包括两个损失：引导注意力损失（GALoss）和框点损失（BPLoss）。GALoss使用实例分割掩模作为基本真值，学习提高小型物体检测所需的注意力特征。这些注意力特征然后用于预测BPLoss中的框点，确定点相对于目标有方向边界框的位置。实验结果表明，我们的Attention-Points网络在标准的航空数据集上效果显著。",
