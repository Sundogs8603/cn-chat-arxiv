    "translated_abstract": "非负张量分解(NTF)已成为从非负高阶数据中提取特征和基于部分表示的重要工具，同时保留了内在结构信息。然而，原始的NTF方法采用欧几里得或Kullback-Leibler散度作为损失函数，将每个特征都视为相等，导致忽视了特征的旁边信息。为了利用特征的相关信息和样本的流形信息，我们引入了Wasserstein流形非负张量分解(WMNTF)，其将输入张量数据的分布和重构的分布之间的Wasserstein距离最小化。尽管在非负矩阵分解(NMF)中已经有一些关于Wasserstein距离的研究，但它们忽视了高阶数据的空间结构信息。我们使用Wasserstein距离(也称为地球移动距离或最优传输距离)作为度量，并添加了一个图正则化项。",
