The success of methods for eviction prediction is typically evaluated using different measures of predictive accuracy. However, the underlying goal of such prediction is to direct appropriate assistance to households that may be at greater risk so they remain stably housed.

In this paper, we investigate this question using a novel dataset that matches information on properties, evictions, and owners. We perform an eviction prediction task to produce risk scores and then use these risk scores to plan targeted outreach policies. We show that the risk scores are, in fact, useful, enabling a theoretical team of caseworkers to reach more eviction-prone properties in the same amount of time, compared to outreach policies that are either neighborhood-based or focus on buildings with ",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于驱逐风险对房产进行评分引起了相当大的关注。驱逐预测方法的成功通常是通过不同的预测准确度指标来评估的。然而，这种预测的根本目标是为了向可能面临更大风险的家庭提供适当的帮助，以保持住房稳定。因此，我们必须问一个问题，那就是这样的预测在指导外展行动方面有多大的用处。本文利用一个新颖的数据集，将房产、驱逐和业主的信息进行匹配，研究这个问题。我们进行了一项驱逐预测任务，生成风险得分，然后利用这些风险得分来规划有针对性的外展政策。我们显示这些风险得分实际上是有用的，能够使一个理论上的工作人员团队在相同的时间内接触更多容易发生驱逐的房产，相比于以街区为基础或关注特定建筑物的外展政策。",
