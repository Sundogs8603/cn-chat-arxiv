    "abstract": "When reasoning about actions, e.g., by means of task planning or agent programming with Golog, the robot's actions are typically modeled on an abstract level, where complex actions such as picking up an object are treated as atomic primitives with deterministic effects and preconditions that only depend on the current state. However, when executing such an action on a robot it can no longer be seen as a primitive. Instead, action execution is a complex task involving multiple steps with additional temporal preconditions and timing constraints. Furthermore, the action may be noisy, e.g., producing erroneous sensing results and not always having the desired effects. While these aspects are typically ignored in reasoning tasks, they need to be dealt with during execution. In this thesis, we propose several approaches towards closing this gap.",

    "translated_abstract": "当进行动作推理时，例如通过任务规划或使用Golog进行代理编程时，通常会将机器人的动作建模为抽象层次，其中复杂的动作（如拾取物体）被视为具有确定性效果和仅依赖于当前状态的前提条件的原子基元。然而，当在机器人上执行此类动作时，它不再可以被视为原子基元。相反，动作执行是一个复杂的任务，涉及多个步骤，具有额外的时间前提条件和时间约束。此外，动作可能会产生噪声，例如产生错误的感知结果，并且不能总是达到期望的效果。尽管在推理任务中通常忽略这些方面，但在执行过程中需要处理它们。在这篇论文中，我们提出了几种方法来弥合这一差距。",
