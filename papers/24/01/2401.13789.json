    "abstract": "In current text-based task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, user emotion detection (ED) is often overlooked or is typically treated as a separate and independent task, requiring additional training. In contrast, our work demonstrates that seamlessly unifying ED and TOD modeling brings about mutual benefits, and is therefore an alternative to be considered. Our method consists in augmenting SimpleToD, an end-to-end TOD system, by extending belief state tracking to include ED, relying on a single language model. We evaluate our approach using GPT-2 and Llama-2 on the EmoWOZ benchmark, a version of MultiWOZ annotated with emotions. Our results reveal a general increase in performance for ED and task results. Our findings also indicate that user emotions provide useful contextual conditioning for system responses, and can be leveraged to further refine responses in terms of empathy.",

    "translated_abstract": "在当前基于文本的任务导向对话（TOD）系统中，用户情感检测（ED）经常被忽视，或者通常被视为一项独立的任务，需要额外的训练。相反，我们的工作证明了无缝地统一ED和TOD建模可以带来相互的好处，因此是一种值得考虑的替代方法。我们的方法是通过将ED包含在信念状态跟踪中，并依赖于单一的语言模型，来扩展SimpleToD这个端到端的TOD系统。我们使用GPT-2和Llama-2在EmoWOZ基准测试集上评估了我们的方法，这是一个使用情感进行注释的MultiWOZ版本。我们的结果显示，ED和任务结果的性能普遍提高。我们的研究结果还表明，用户的情感为系统的回应提供了有用的上下文条件，并可以用于进一步改善回应的共鸣程度。",
    "tldr": "提出了一种统一的方法来实现情感检测和任务导向对话建模，通过在信念状态跟踪中引入情感检测实现，并将其融入端到端的任务导向对话系统中。实验证明该方法提高了情感检测和任务结果的性能，并显示用户的情感可以作为回应的上下文条件，对于提高回应的共鸣程度具有帮助。",
    "en_tdlr": "A unified approach is proposed for emotion detection and task-oriented dialogue modeling, integrating emotion detection into belief state tracking and combining it with an end-to-end task-oriented dialogue system. The experimental results demonstrate improved performance in emotion detection and task outcomes, and indicate that user emotions can serve as useful contextual conditions to enhance empathy in system responses."
