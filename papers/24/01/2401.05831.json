    "translated_abstract": "轮廓系数是一种常用的内部聚类评估指标，它会为每个数据点产生一个得分，用于评估其聚类分配的质量。目前，为了评估整个数据集的聚类质量，通常会将数据集中所有点的得分平均成一个单一值，这个策略被称为微观平均。然而我们在本文中通过使用一个合成例子展示了，该微观平均策略对于聚类不均衡和异常值（背景噪声）非常敏感。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种替代聚合策略，该策略首先对聚类级别的轮廓得分进行平均，然后再对所有聚类的得分进行宏观平均。基于相同的合成例子，我们展示了提出的宏观平均轮廓得分对于聚类不均衡和背景噪声是稳健的。我们进行了实验研究，结果表明我们提出的宏观平均变体可以更好地估计真实的聚类数量。",
