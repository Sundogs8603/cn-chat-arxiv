    "translated_abstract": "本论文的核心目标是通过改进深度学习模型的标签和训练效率来提高深度学习的实用性。为此，我们探讨了基于信息论原则的数据子集选择技术，特别是主动学习和主动采样。主动学习提高了标签效率，而主动采样则提高了训练效率。监督式深度学习模型通常需要大量带标签的数据进行训练。标签获取可能既昂贵又耗时，并且训练大模型需要大量资源，这限制了其在学术研究和“大型科技公司”以外的应用。现有的深度学习数据子集选择方法通常依赖于启发式方法或缺乏基于信息论的原则基础。相比之下，本论文对深度学习中的数据子集选择目标及其应用进行了研究，力求通过信息论的启发，提出更具原则性的方法。",
