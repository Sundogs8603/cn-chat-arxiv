    "translated_abstract": "在今天的以数据驱动的世界中，公开可获得的信息的增加加剧了信息泄漏（IL）的挑战，引发了安全问题。IL涉及通过系统的可观察信息无意地将秘密（敏感）信息暴露给未经授权的方，传统的统计方法通过估计可观察信息和秘密信息之间的互信息（MI）来检测IL，面临维度灾难、收敛、计算复杂度和MI估计错误等挑战。此外，虽然新兴的监督机器学习（ML）方法在二进制系统敏感信息的检测上有效，但缺乏一个全面的理论框架。为了解决这些限制，我们使用统计学习理论和信息论建立了一个理论框架来准确量化和检测IL。我们证明了可以通过近似贝叶斯预测的对数损失和准确性来准确估计MI。",
