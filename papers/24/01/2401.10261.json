    "translated_abstract": "本文利用空间计量经济学方法分析了德国NUTS 3地区的面板数据。我们旨在深入理解产业集群在塑造GDP动态中的重要性和相互依存关系。为了获得更细致的空间区分，我们引入了每个行业部门的指标矩阵，这使得我们可以将空间Durbin模型扩展为其新版本。这种方法对于既有这些行业部门的经济重要性，也对于忽略变量可能引发的问题都是必要的。忽略行业部门可能导致遗漏变量偏误和估计问题。为了评估主要行业部门的影响，我们将八个不同的行业分支纳入我们的分析中。根据现行经济学理论，这些集群应该对它们所关联的区域产生积极影响。我们的研究结果确实揭示了高度显著的影响，这些影响可以是积极的，也可以是消极的。",
