    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了多头高斯自适应注意力机制（GAAM），一种新颖的概率注意力框架，并设计了高斯自适应变压器（GAT），旨在增强跨多个模态（包括语音、文本和视觉）的信息聚合。GAAM将可学习的均值和方差融入其注意力机制中，采用多头框架实现，使其能够集体建模任何概率分布，以动态重新调整特征重要性。该方法在处理高度非平稳数据时表现出显著改进，通过识别特征空间中的关键元素，超越了现有的注意力技术在模型性能上的状态（精度增加约20%）。GAAM与基于点积的注意力模型兼容，并具有相对较低的参数数量，展示了其适应性和提升现有注意力框架的潜力。在实证方面，GAAM表现出卓越的适应性和功效。",
