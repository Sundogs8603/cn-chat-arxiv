    "translated_abstract": "技术和产业的迅速变化导致技能需求动态变化，因此员工和雇主预测这种变化以在劳动市场保持竞争优势至关重要。现有的研究要么依赖于领域专家知识，要么将技能演变视为简化的时间序列预测问题。然而，这两种方法都忽视了不同技能之间复杂的关系以及技能需求和供应变化之间的内在联系。本文提出了一种用于联合技能需求和供应预测的跨视角分层图学习超网络（CHGH）框架。具体而言，CHGH是一个编码器-解码器网络，包括：i) 一个跨视角图编码器用于捕捉技能需求和供应之间的相互关联，ii) 一个层次图编码器用于从集群角度建模技能的共同演变，iii) 一个条件超解码器用于共同预测需求和供应变量。",
