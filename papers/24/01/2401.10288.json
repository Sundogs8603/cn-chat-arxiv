    "abstract": "In ambient assisted living, human activity recognition from time series sensor data mainly focuses on predefined activities, often overlooking new activity patterns. We propose CLAN, a two-tower contrastive learning-based novelty detection framework with diverse types of negative pairs for human activity recognition. It is tailored to challenges with human activity characteristics, including the significance of temporal and frequency features, complex activity dynamics, shared features across activities, and sensor modality variations. The framework aims to construct invariant representations of known activity robust to the challenges. To generate suitable negative pairs, it selects data augmentation methods according to the temporal and frequency characteristics of each dataset. It derives the key representations against meaningless dynamics by contrastive and classification losses-based representation learning and score function-based novelty detection that accommodate dynamic number",

    "translated_abstract": "在环境辅助生活中，从时间序列传感器数据进行人体活动识别主要集中于预定义的活动，往往忽略了新的活动模式。我们提出了CLAN，一种基于对比学习的新颖性检测框架，其中包含了不同类型的负样本对于人体活动识别。该框架针对人体活动特征的挑战进行了优化，包括时间和频率特征的重要性、复杂的活动动态、活动之间共享的特征，以及传感器模态的变化。该框架旨在构建对挑战具有不变性的已知活动的表示方法。为了生成合适的负样本对，它根据每个数据集的时间和频率特征选择数据增强方法。它通过对比和分类损失的表示学习以及基于评分函数的新颖性检测，从中导出针对无意义动态的关键表示。",
