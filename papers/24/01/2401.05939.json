    "abstract": "While entity-oriented neural IR models have advanced significantly, they often overlook a key nuance: the varying degrees of influence individual entities within a document have on its overall relevance. Addressing this gap, we present DREQ, an entity-oriented dense document re-ranking model. Uniquely, we emphasize the query-relevant entities within a document's representation while simultaneously attenuating the less relevant ones, thus obtaining a query-specific entity-centric document representation. We then combine this entity-centric document representation with the text-centric representation of the document to obtain a \"hybrid\" representation of the document. We learn a relevance score for the document using this hybrid representation. Using four large-scale benchmarks, we show that DREQ outperforms state-of-the-art neural and non-neural re-ranking methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our entity-oriented representation approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管基于实体的神经信息检索（IR）模型取得了显著进展，但它们经常忽视了一个关键细微差别：文档中各个实体对其整体相关性的影响程度是不同的。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了DREQ，一种基于实体的密集文档重新排序模型。独特之处在于，在文档的表示中强调与查询相关的实体，同时减弱不太相关的实体，从而获得一个查询特定的以实体为中心的文档表示。然后，将这种以实体为中心的文档表示与文本为中心的文档表示结合起来，获得文档的“混合”表示。我们使用这种混合表示学习文档的相关性分数。通过使用四个大规模基准测试，我们证明DREQ优于最先进的神经网络和非神经网络的重新排序方法，突出了我们基于实体的表示方法的有效性。",
