    "abstract": "More than seventy years ago Harry Markowitz formulated portfolio construction as an optimization problem that trades off expected return and risk, defined as the standard deviation of the portfolio returns. Since then the method has been extended to include many practical constraints and objective terms, such as transaction cost or leverage limits. Despite several criticisms of Markowitz's method, for example its sensitivity to poor forecasts of the return statistics, it has become the dominant quantitative method for portfolio construction in practice. In this article we describe an extension of Markowitz's method that addresses many practical effects and gracefully handles the uncertainty inherent in return statistics forecasting. Like Markowitz's original formulation, the extension is also a convex optimization problem, which can be solved with high reliability and speed.",

    "translated_abstract": "七十多年前，哈里·马科维茨将组合构建定义为一个优化问题，权衡了期望收益和风险，风险被定义为组合回报的标准差。自那时起，该方法已经扩展到包括许多实际约束和目标项，如交易成本或杠杆限制。尽管Markowitz方法受到了一些批评，比如对回报统计的糟糕预测敏感，但它已成为实践中组合构建的主要定量方法。在本文中，我们描述了Markowitz方法的扩展，解决了许多实际效果，并优雅地处理了回报统计预测的不确定性。像Markowitz最初的表述一样，这个扩展也是一个凸优化问题，可以以高可靠性和速度解决。",
    "tldr": "七十多年来，Markowitz的组合构建方法一直被广泛应用于实践中，尽管受到一些批评，但通过扩展方法改进，我们能够更好地处理预测的不确定性，并在高可靠性和速度的情况下解决实际约束和目标项。"
