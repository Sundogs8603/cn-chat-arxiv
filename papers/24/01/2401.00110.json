    "translated_abstract": "使用均方误差损失训练的扩散模型倾向于生成不真实的样本。目前的最先进模型依靠无分类器指导来改善样本质量，然而其惊人的效果尚未完全理解。本文中，我们展示了无分类器指导的有效性在一定程度上源自其作为一种隐式感知指导的形式。因此，我们可以直接在扩散训练中加入感知损失来提高样本质量。由于扩散训练中使用的分数匹配目标与无监督训练感知网络时使用的去噪自动编码器目标非常相似，因此扩散模型本身就是一个感知网络，并可以用于生成有意义的感知损失。我们提出了一种新颖的自感知目标，其结果是扩散模型能够生成更真实的样本。对于条件生成，我们的方法仅改善样本质量，而不与条件绑定。",
