    "translated_abstract": "自一致性是一种广泛应用于思维链推理的解码策略。尽管在各种多步推理任务中带来了显著的性能提升，但自一致性是一种高成本的方法，需要进行多次预设大小的抽样。本文提出了一种简单且可扩展的采样过程——提前停止自一致性（ESC），以极大降低自一致性的成本，同时不损害性能。在此基础上，还进一步推导了一种控制方案，可以动态选择不同任务和模型的性能和成本平衡。为了证明ESC的有效性，我们在三个常见的推理任务类别上进行了大量实验：算术推理、常识推理和符号推理。实验结果表明，在包括MATH在内的六个基准测试中，ESC将思维链推理的平均抽样次数显著减少了（-33.8%）。",
