    "translated_abstract": "作为计算化学中的基础任务，反向合成预测旨在识别一组反应物来合成目标分子。现有的无模板方法只考虑目标分子的图结构，往往不能很好地推广到罕见的反应类型和大分子。在这里，我们提出了T-Rex，一种使用预训练文本语言模型（如ChatGPT）来辅助生成反应物的反向合成预测方法。T-Rex首先利用ChatGPT为目标分子生成描述，并基于描述和分子图对候选反应中心进行排名。然后，通过查询每个反应物的描述，并检查哪组反应物最能合成目标分子，重新对这些候选进行排名。我们观察到T-Rex在两个数据集上明显优于基于图的最先进方法，这表明考虑文本信息的有效性。",
