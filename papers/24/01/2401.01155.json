    "translated_abstract": "标记码是一种有效的编码方案，可以保护数据免受插入和删除操作的影响。它在未来的存储系统，如DNA存储和赛道记忆中具有潜在的应用。在解码标记码时，需要完美的信道状态信息（CSI），即插入和删除错误的概率，来检测插入和删除错误。然而，有时候很难获得完美的CSI或准确的信道模型。因此，有必要开发一种不需要完美CSI知识的标记码检测算法。在本文中，我们提出了两种基于深度学习的CSI无关检测算法，用于标记码检测。第一种是一种模型驱动的深度学习方法，它深度展开了原始的迭代检测算法。在这种方法中，CSI成为神经网络中的权重，这些权重可以从训练数据中学习得到。第二种是一种数据驱动的方法，它是一个端对端系统，基于深度双向神经网络。",
