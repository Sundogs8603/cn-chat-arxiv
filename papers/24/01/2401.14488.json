    "abstract": "One problem with researching cognitive modeling and reinforcement learning (RL) is that researchers spend too much time on setting up an appropriate computational framework for their experiments. Many open source implementations of current RL algorithms exist, but there is a lack of a modular suite of tools combining different robotic simulators and platforms, data visualization, hyperparameter optimization, and baseline experiments. To address this problem, we present Scilab-RL, a software framework for efficient research in cognitive modeling and reinforcement learning for robotic agents. The framework focuses on goal-conditioned reinforcement learning using Stable Baselines 3 and the OpenAI gym interface. It enables native possibilities for experiment visualizations and hyperparameter optimization. We describe how these features enable researchers to conduct experiments with minimal time effort, thus maximizing research output.",

    "translated_abstract": "研究认知建模和增强学习的一个问题是，研究人员花费太多时间来设置适当的计算框架进行实验。存在许多当前增强学习算法的开源实现，但缺乏一个模块化的工具套件，结合不同的机器人模拟器和平台、数据可视化、超参数优化和基准实验。为解决这个问题，我们提出了Scilab-RL，这是一个用于机器人代理的认知建模和增强学习研究的软件框架。该框架专注于使用稳定的基线3和OpenAI gym接口进行目标条件增强学习。它提供了原生的实验可视化和超参数优化的可能性。我们描述了这些功能如何使研究人员只需最少的时间和精力就能进行实验，从而最大程度地提高研究产出。",
