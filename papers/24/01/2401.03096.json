    "translated_abstract": "本研究实验性地研究了欧洲和亚洲发展中国家（如孟加拉国）的外商直接投资(IFDI)。新兴市场的IFDI得到了全球投资和流入的推动，受到资源可用性和公共政策的影响。我们探讨了在俄乌战争危机对全球产生影响的同时，13个国家的经济政策不确定性对IFDI的影响。微观经济因素影响了国内生产总值（GDP）增长、通胀、利率和货币汇率的波动，其中在COVID-19疫情和俄乌战争期间影响最大。通过世界银行和联合国贸易和发展会议（UNCTAD）数据库的数据，我们编制了一个涵盖2018-2022年的面板数据集。研究人员使用了混合面板和线性回归分析，采用随机效应模型。我们的研究结果表明全球利率冲击了13个选定国家的IFDI。在IFDI和全球经济利率之间存在相关性。",
