    "translated_abstract": "文本分析是数据科学中一个有趣的研究领域，具有人工智能、生物医学研究和工程等多种应用。我们回顾了文本分析的流行方法，从主题建模到最新的神经语言模型。特别是，我们回顾了Topic-SCORE，一种用于主题建模的统计方法，并讨论了如何使用它来分析我们收集和清理的统计出版物数据集MADStat。在MADStat上应用Topic-SCORE和其他方法得到了有趣的发现。例如，我们鉴定出了统计领域中11个代表性的主题。对于每个期刊，可以可视化主题权重随时间的变化，并利用这些结果分析统计研究的趋势。特别是，我们提出了一种用于排名11个主题引用影响的新的统计模型，还构建了一个跨主题的引用图，以说明不同主题的研究成果是如何传播到其他领域的。",

This paper reviews popular methods in text analysis and introduces a new statistical method called Topic-SCORE. The method is applied to the statistical publication dataset MADStat, leading to the identification of 11 representative topics in statistics. Additionally, a new statistical model is proposed to rank the citation impact of these topics, and a cross-topic citation graph is constructed to analyze the spread of research results across different fields."
