    "translated_abstract": "基于WiFi信道状态信息（CSI）的人体活动识别（HAR）使得在空间受限的环境中保持视觉隐私的情况下实现了非接触式、长距离感知。然而，尽管周围存在许多支持WiFi的设备，但很少有设备向用户公开CSI，导致感知硬件选择有限。Espressif ESP32的变体已经成为潜在的低成本、易于部署的WiFi CSI-based HAR解决方案。在这项工作中，对基于四个ESP32-S3的2.4GHz定向天线系统进行了评估，以评估其支持长距离穿墙HAR的能力。提出了两个有前景的系统，其中一个将ESP32-S3与定向双极天线相结合。据我们所知，这种组合是WiFi基础HAR中的首次演示。第二个系统依靠ESP32-S3的内置印刷倒F天线（PIFA）并通过平面反射器实现方向性。在全面评估中，这两个系统显示出很好的性能。",
