    "translated_abstract": "共享资源的治理需要用户合作，并避免过度利用，但是叛逃和搭便车经常破坏合作。我们建模了一个人-环境系统，整合了资源和用户策略的动态。资源遵循一个依赖于自然增长率、承载能力和合作者和叛逃者的开采率的逻辑函数。用户的策略根据不同的过程演化，捕捉到了回报、资源和噪声的影响。我们分析了资源可用性和策略适应之间的反馈，并探讨了合作的出现与维持的条件。我们发现不同的过程导致不同的均衡解和资源水平的状态，这取决于参数配置和初始条件。我们还显示出一些过程可以通过使用户对资源的稀缺性更加敏感来增强资源的可持续性。该论文推进了对共享资源治理的理解和探讨，提出了一个耦合的人-环境系统模型。",
