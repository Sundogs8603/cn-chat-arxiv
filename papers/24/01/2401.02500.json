    "translated_abstract": "自动规划与调度是人工智能领域中增长迅速的领域之一，其中大型语言模型（LLMs）的应用越来越受到关注。本文基于对126篇论文的综合回顾，研究了LLMs在解决规划问题的各个方面中独特应用的八个类别：语言翻译、计划生成、模型构建、多智能体规划、交互式规划、启发式优化、工具集成和脑启发式规划。针对每个类别，我们明确了考虑的问题和现有的空白。我们回顾的一个重要观点是，在与传统符号规划器集成时，LLMs的真正潜力得以发挥，这指向了一种有前景的神经符号方法。这种方法有效地将LLMs的生成能力与经典规划方法的精确性结合起来。通过综合现有文献的见解，我们强调了这种集成在解决复杂规划问题上的潜力。",
