    "translated_abstract": "在神经科学中，有一个普遍的假设认为视网膜中的神经节细胞通过选择性地检测观察场景中的视觉特征来被激活。虽然可以通过数据训练的深度神经网络预测神经节细胞的放电，但网络仍然是无法解释的，因此对细胞潜在操作的理解十分有限。为了从细胞放电中提取知识，在本文中我们从数据中学习了一个可解释的基于图的分类器，用于预测神经节细胞对视觉刺激的放电。具体而言，我们学习了一个正半定（PSD）度量矩阵$\\mathbf{M} \\succeq 0$，该矩阵定义了具有预计算特征向量的图节点（视觉事件）之间的马氏距离；计算的节点间距离导致边权重和可进行二进制分类的组合图。数学上，我们使用大边界最近邻的图适应形式来定义度量矩阵$\\mathbf{M}$优化的目标。",
