    "abstract": "We conduct a large-scale fine-grained comparative analysis of machine translations (MT) against human translations (HT) through the lens of morphosyntactic divergence. Across three language pairs and two types of divergence defined as the structural difference between the source and the target, MT is consistently more conservative than HT, with less morphosyntactic diversity, more convergent patterns, and more one-to-one alignments. Through analysis on different decoding algorithms, we attribute this discrepancy to the use of beam search that biases MT towards more convergent patterns. This bias is most amplified when the convergent pattern appears around 50% of the time in training data. Lastly, we show that for a majority of morphosyntactic divergences, their presence in HT is correlated with decreased MT performance, presenting a greater challenge for MT systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们通过构词-句法分歧的镜头进行了大规模的细致比较分析，对比了机器翻译（MT）和人工翻译（HT）。在三种语言对和两种定义为源语言和目标语言之间的结构差异的分歧类型下，机器翻译始终比人工翻译更为保守，具有较少的构词-句法多样性，更多的收敛性模式和更多的一对一对应关系。通过对不同解码算法的分析，我们将这种差异归因于束搜索的使用，这使得机器翻译偏向于更为收敛的模式。当收敛模式出现在训练数据中约50%的时间时，这种偏向性会被放大。最后，我们表明对于大多数构词-句法分歧，其存在于人工翻译中与机器翻译的性能下降相关，给机器翻译系统带来了更大的挑战。",
