A data augmentation strategy is used to deal with the problem of data scarcity. Through the years, much work has been done on data augmentation for the English language. In contrast, very less work has been done on Indian languages. This is contrary to the fact that data augmentation is used to deal with data scarcity. In this work, we focus on implementing techniques like Easy Data Augmentation, Back Translation, Paraphrasing, Text Generation using LLMs, and Text Expansion using LLMs for text classification on different languages. We focus on 6 Indian languages namely: Sindhi, Marathi, Hindi, Gujarati, Telugu, and Sanskrit. According to our knowledge, no such work exists for text augmentation on Indian languages. We carry out binary as well as multi-class text classification to make our results more comparable. We get surprising results as basic data augmentation techniq",

    "translated_abstract": "文本增强是低资源语言中重要的任务，它有助于解决数据稀缺问题。通过数据增强策略来应对数据稀缺问题。多年来，已经对英语进行了大量的数据增强工作，而在印度语言方面却做得很少。这与使用数据增强来处理数据稀缺的事实相反。在这项工作中，我们重点实施Easy Data Augmentation、Back Translation、Paraphrasing、使用LLMs进行文本生成以及使用LLMs进行文本扩展等技术，用于不同语言的文本分类。我们重点关注6种印度语言：信德语、马拉地语、印地语、古吉拉特语、泰卢固语和梵语。据我们所知，目前没有类似的工作用于印度语言的文本增强。我们进行了二元和多类文本分类，以使我们的结果更具可比性。我们得到了令人惊讶的结果，基本的数据增强技术可显著提升性能。",
