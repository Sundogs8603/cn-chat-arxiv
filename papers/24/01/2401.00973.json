    "abstract": "The primary goal of this project is to develop privacy-preserving machine learning model training techniques for fNIRS data. This project will build a local model in a centralized setting with both differential privacy (DP) and certified robustness. It will also explore collaborative federated learning to train a shared model between multiple clients without sharing local fNIRS datasets. To prevent unintentional private information leakage of such clients' private datasets, we will also implement DP in the federated learning setting.",
