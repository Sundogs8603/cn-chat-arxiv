    "title": "Stylized Facts and Market Microstructure: An In-Depth Exploration of German Bond Futures Market. (arXiv:2401.10722v1 [q-fin.ST])",
    "abstract": "This paper presents an in-depth analysis of stylized facts in the context of futures on German bonds. The study examines four futures contracts on German bonds: Schatz, Bobl, Bund and Buxl, using tick-by-tick limit order book datasets. It uncovers a range of stylized facts and empirical observations, including the distribution of order sizes, patterns of order flow, and inter-arrival times of orders. The findings reveal both commonalities and unique characteristics across the different futures, thereby enriching our understanding of these markets. Furthermore, the paper introduces insightful realism metrics that can be used to benchmark market simulators. The study contributes to the literature on financial stylized facts by extending empirical observations to this class of assets, which has been relatively underexplored in existing research. This work provides valuable guidance for the development of more accurate and realistic market simulators.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文在德国债券期货的背景下，对风格化事实进行了深入分析。研究使用逐笔限价挂单簿数据集，考察了德国债券的四个期货合约：Schatz、Bobl、Bund和Buxl。它揭示了一系列风格化事实和实证观察，包括订单大小的分布、订单流量的模式以及订单的到达间隔时间。研究结果展示了不同期货之间的共性和独特特征，丰富了我们对这些市场的认识。此外，本文引入了具有启发性的现实主义指标，可用于对市场模拟器进行基准测试。本研究通过将实证观察拓展到这一类资产，从而丰富了金融风格化事实的文献，而这一类资产在现有研究中相对未被充分开发。这项工作为更准确、更真实的市场模拟器的发展提供了宝贵的指导。",
