    "abstract": "In automotive applications, frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar is an established technology to determine the distance, velocity and angle of objects in the vicinity of the vehicle. The quality of predictions might be seriously impaired if mutual interference between radar sensors occurs. Previous work processes data from the entire receiver array in parallel to increase interference mitigation quality using neural networks (NNs). However, these architectures do not generalize well across different angles of arrival (AoAs) of interferences and objects. In this paper we introduce fully convolutional neural network (CNN) with rank-three convolutions which is able to transfer learned patterns between different AoAs. Our proposed architecture outperforms previous work while having higher robustness and a lower number of trainable parameters. We evaluate our network on a diverse data set and demonstrate its angle equivariance.",

    "translated_abstract": "在汽车应用中，频率调制连续波（FMCW）雷达是一种确定车辆周围物体距离、速度和角度的成熟技术。如果雷达传感器之间发生互相干扰，预测质量可能会严重受损。先前的工作使用神经网络（NNs）并行处理整个接收器阵列的数据，以提高干扰抑制质量。然而，这些架构在不同角度的干扰和物体到达（AoAs）之间不具备很好的泛化能力。在本文中，我们引入了完全卷积神经网络（CNN）与三阶卷积，能够在不同的AoAs之间传递学习到的模式。我们的提议架构在性能上优于先前的工作，同时具有更高的鲁棒性和更少的可训练参数数量。我们在多样的数据集上评估了我们的网络，并展示了其角度等变性。",
