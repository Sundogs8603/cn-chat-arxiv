    "translated_abstract": "层次主题建模旨在从语料库中发现潜在主题，并将它们组织成一个层次结构，以便理解具有期望语义粒度的文档。然而，现有工作在产生低亲和性、合理性和多样性的主题层次方面存在困难，这阻碍了文档的理解。为了克服这些挑战，本文提出了传输计划和上下文感知的层次主题模型（TraCo）。我们提出了一种传输计划依赖方法，而不是之前简单的主题依赖方法。它限制依赖关系以确保它们的稀疏性和平衡性，并通过它们对主题层次结构进行正则化。这改善了层次结构的亲和性和多样性。我们还提出了一种上下文感知的解缠码器。它通过解缠编码将不同的语义粒度分配给不同层次的主题，从而有助于层次结构的合理性。在基准数据集上的实验证明了我们方法的有效性。",
