Distinct strategies emerged between users depending on the type of assistant. Participants using the LLM-based search issued longer, more natural language queries, but had shorter search ses",

    "translated_abstract": "Web搜索引擎长期以来一直是信息检索的必不可少的工具；用户行为和查询形式的策略已经得到了深入研究。基于大语言模型（LLM）驱动的搜索引擎的引入提出了更加对话式的搜索和新类型的查询策略。本文比较了传统和基于LLM的搜索在图像地理位置搜索任务中的效果，即确定图像拍摄地点。我们的研究主要关注用户的交互，尤其是查询形式的策略。在我们的研究中，我们为60名参与者分配了传统或基于LLM的搜索引擎作为地理位置搜索的助手。相比使用LLM-based搜索的参与者，使用传统搜索的参与者更准确地预测了图像的位置。根据助手的类型，使用者之间出现了不同的策略。使用LLM-based搜索的参与者提出了更长、更自然语言的查询，但搜索会话更短。",
