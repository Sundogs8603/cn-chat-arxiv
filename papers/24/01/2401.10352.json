    "translated_abstract": "对话代理与文化的交互领域是一个引人注目但相对未被探索的领域。各种社会文化方面，从沟通风格和信念到共享的隐喻和知识，都深刻地影响着这些交互。为了更深入地研究这一动态，我们引入了cuDialog，这是一个以文化为视角的对话生成基准。我们还开发了能够从对话交流中提取文化属性的基准模型，旨在提高对话代理的预测准确性和质量。为了有效地共同学习文化理解和多轮对话预测，我们提出将文化维度与对话编码特征相结合。我们的实验结果表明，加入文化价值调查能够增强与参考文献和文化标记的一致性，显示出它对个性化和对话质量的重要影响。为了进一步促进对话代理与文化的交互探索。",
