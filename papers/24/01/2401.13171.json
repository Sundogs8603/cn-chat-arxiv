    "translated_abstract": "逆设计是一种寻求设计输入变量以优化底层目标函数的重要问题，在机械工程到航天工程等领域都有应用。逆设计通常被构建成一个优化问题，最近的研究利用了学习的动力学模型进行优化。然而，由于模型的优化往往会陷入对抗模式，阻碍有效的抽样。我们证明，通过优化扩散模型捕获的学习能量函数，我们可以避免这种对抗性示例，并显著提高设计性能。我们进一步展示了这样一个设计系统是组合性的，使我们能够结合多个不同的扩散模型来代表所需系统的子组件，从而设计具有每个指定组件的系统。在一个N体相互作用任务和一个具有挑战性的二维多翼型设计任务中，我们证明通过组合学习的能量函数，可以实现更好的设计性能。",
