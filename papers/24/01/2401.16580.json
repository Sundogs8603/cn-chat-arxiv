    "abstract": "Job shop scheduling problems are one of the most important and challenging combinatorial optimization problems that have been tackled mainly by exact or approximate solution approaches. However, finding an exact solution can be infeasible for real-world problems, and even with an approximate solution approach, it can require a prohibitive amount of time to find a near-optimal solution, and the found solutions are not applicable to new problems in general. To address these challenges, we propose an attention-based reinforcement learning method for the class of job shop scheduling problems by integrating policy gradient reinforcement learning with a modified transformer architecture. An important result is that our trained learners in the proposed method can be reused to solve large-scale problems not used in training and demonstrate that our approach outperforms the results of recent studies and widely adopted heuristic rules.",

    "translated_abstract": "作业车间调度问题是一类重要且具有挑战性的组合优化问题，主要通过精确或近似的解决方法来解决。然而，寻找精确解对于实际问题来说是不可行的，即使采用近似解决方法，也可能需要大量的时间来找到近似最优解，并且找到的解决方案通常不能应用于新问题。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种基于注意力的强化学习方法，用于解决作业车间调度问题，该方法将策略梯度强化学习与修改后的Transformer结构进行了集成。一个重要的结果是，我们在所提出的方法中训练的学习者可以用于解决未参与训练的大规模问题，并且证明我们的方法优于最近研究和广泛采用的启发式规则的结果。",
