We aim to learn the dependence structure among the different yield curves induced by the globalization of financial markets and exploit it to produce more accurate forecasts. By combining the self-attention mechanism and nonparametric quantile regression, our model generates both point and interval forecasts of future yields. The architecture is designed to avoid quantile crossing issues affecting multiple quantile regression models. Numerical experiments conducted on two different datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we explore potential extensions and enhancements by incorporating deep ensemble methods and transfer learning mechanisms.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种使用深度学习模型同时描述多种收益率曲线动态的方法。我们旨在学习金融市场全球化引起的不同收益率曲线之间的依赖结构，并利用它来产生更准确的预测。通过结合自注意机制和非参数分位数回归，我们的模型可以生成未来收益率的点预测和区间预测。该框架的设计旨在避免影响多个分位数回归模型的分位数交叉问题。对两个不同数据集进行的数值实验证实了我们方法的有效性。最后，我们通过结合深度集成方法和迁移学习机制，探讨了潜在的扩展和改进。",
