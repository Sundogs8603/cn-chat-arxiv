    "translated_abstract": "无监督领域转换（UDT）旨在找到将一个领域的样本（例如素描）转换为另一个领域（例如照片）的函数，同时不改变高层语义意义（也称为“内容”）。这些转换函数通常通过转换源领域和目标领域的概率分布来寻找。CycleGAN可以说是这一领域中最具代表性的方法。然而，文献中指出CycleGAN及其变体可能无法识别所需的转换函数，并产生内容不对齐的转换。这种局限性源于学习准则解空间中存在多个转换函数，称为“保度自同构（MPA）”。尽管意识到了这种可识别性问题，但解决方案仍然难以找到。本研究深入探究了核心的可识别性问题，并引入了MPA消除理论。我们的分析表明...",
