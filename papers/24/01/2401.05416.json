    "translated_abstract": "作为姿态和运动感应部件，惯性传感器广泛应用于各种便携设备中。然而，惯性传感器的严重误差限制了它们的功能，特别是轨迹恢复和语义识别。小波作为主流的信号处理方法，由于丰富多样的小波基函数而被誉为信号的数学显微镜。然而，惯性传感器的复杂噪声类型和应用场景使得选择适当的小波基函数变得困难。为此，我们提出了一种小波动态选择网络（WDSNet），它能智能地为可变惯性信号选择适当的小波基函数。此外，现有的深度学习架构擅长从输入数据中提取特征，但忽视了学习目标类别的特征，这对于提高类别感知能力、改善小波基函数的选择是必要的。因此，我们提出了一种类别表示机制。",
