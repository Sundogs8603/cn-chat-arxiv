    "translated_abstract": "Copernicus区域再分析数据集CERRA是一个高分辨率的欧洲区域再分析数据集。近年来，在各种与气候相关的任务中它显示出了显著的实用性，包括天气预报、气候变化研究、可再生能源预测、资源管理、空气质量风险评估以及罕见事件的预测等。不幸的是，由于获取所需外部数据和生成过程中计算量大，CERRA的可用性滞后于当前日期两年。作为解决方案，本文提出了一种新的方法，使用扩散模型以数据驱动的方式近似CERRA的降尺度，而无需额外信息。通过利用边界条件由低分辨率ERA5数据集提供的CERRA数据，我们将其视为超分辨率任务。以意大利周围的风速为重点，我们的模型在现有CERRA数据上进行训练。",
