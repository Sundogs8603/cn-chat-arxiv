    "abstract": "Speech foundation models (SFMs) have been benchmarked on many speech processing tasks, often achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal adaptation. However, the SFM paradigm has been significantly less explored for applications of interest to the speech perception community. In this paper we present a systematic evaluation of 10 SFMs on one such application: Speech intelligibility prediction. We focus on the non-intrusive setup of the Clarity Prediction Challenge 2 (CPC2), where the task is to predict the percentage of words correctly perceived by hearing-impaired listeners from speech-in-noise recordings. We propose a simple method that learns a lightweight specialized prediction head on top of frozen SFMs to approach the problem. Our results reveal statistically significant differences in performance across SFMs. Our method resulted in the winning submission in the CPC2, demonstrating its promise for speech perception applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "语音基础模型（SFM）已经在许多语音处理任务中进行了基准测试，往往以最小的调整实现了最先进的性能。然而，对于与语音知觉社区感兴趣的应用，SFM范式的研究明显较少。本文对10种SFM进行了系统评估，以在一个这样的应用中进行研究：语音清晰度预测。我们专注于Clarity Prediction Challenge 2（CPC2）的非侵入性设置，其中任务是预测听力受损听众从噪声录音中正确理解的单词百分比。我们提出了一种简单的方法，该方法在冻结的SFM之上学习一个轻量级的专门的预测头来解决这个问题。我们的结果显示出SFM之间性能差异有统计学上的显著差异。我们的方法在CPC2中获得了获胜的提交，展示了它在语音知觉应用中的潜力。",
