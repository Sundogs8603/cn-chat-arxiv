    "translated_abstract": "最近，半定规划（SDP）技术在为神经网络提供准确的Lipschitz界限方面显示出巨大的潜力。具体而言，LipSDP方法（Fazlyab等，2019）受到了广泛关注，并提供了可以在多项式时间保证下计算的最不保守的Lipschitz上界。然而，LipSDP的一个主要限制是其公式要求激活函数在[0,1]上具有限制斜率，从而阻止其进一步用于更一般的激活函数，如GroupSort、MaxMin和Householder。例如，可以将MaxMin激活重新写成残差ReLU网络。但是，将LipSDP直接应用于结果残差ReLU网络是保守的，甚至无法恢复MaxMin激活是1-Lipschitz的已知事实。本文弥合了这一差距，将LipSDP扩展到斜率限制之外的激活函数上。为此，我们提供了GroupSort、Ma的新二次约束。",
