Inspired by the discrete concentration theory we have conducted an axiomatic study of seven properties that a selection function should fulfill: the minimum and maximum uncertainty principle, invariant to adding zeros, invariant to scale transformations, principle of nominal increase, transfer principle and the richest get richer inequality. We also present a novel selection function based on the use of similarity metrics, and more specifically the cosine measure which is commonly used in information retrieval, and demonstrate that this verifies six of the properties in addition to a weaker variant of the transfer principle, thereby representing a good selection approach. The theoretical study was complemented with an empirical study to compare the performance ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了从一组文档中构建用户配置文件的问题。该配置文件由文档中最有代表性的术语子集组成，最好地代表用户的偏好或兴趣。受到离散集中理论的启发，我们对选择函数应满足的七个属性进行了公理研究：最小和最大不确定性原理，对添加零的不变性，对比例变换的不变性，名义增加原则，传递原则和最富有获取更多不等式。我们还提出了一种基于相似性度量的新型选择函数，特别是在信息检索中常用的余弦度量，并证明这种方法符合六个属性以及传递原则的较弱变体，从而代表了一种良好的选择方法。理论研究与实证研究相结合，以比较配置文件构建性能。",
