    "translated_abstract": "鲁棒性认证旨在正式认证神经网络对抗性输入的预测，已成为安全关键应用的重要工具之一。尽管取得了相当大的进展，现有的认证方法仅限于基本架构（如卷积网络、循环网络和最近的Transformer）和基准数据集（如MNIST）。本文关注于场景文本识别（STR）的鲁棒性认证，这是一种复杂且广泛部署的基于图像的序列预测问题。我们针对三种STR模型架构，包括标准STR流水线和视觉Transformer。通过衍生出新的多面体边界和关键STR模型组件的算法，我们提出了STR-Cert，这是第一种用于STR模型的认证方法。最后，我们在六个数据集上对STR模型进行认证和比较，展示了其效果。",
