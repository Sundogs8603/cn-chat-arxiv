    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个基于声誉的威胁缓解框架，用于在联邦学习的模型聚合过程中防御电脑脑电图（EEG）信号分类的潜在安全威胁。虽然由于脑-计算机界面（BCI）技术的出现，脑电信号分析受到了关注，但由于分布式的EEG数据的性质以及相关的隐私和安全问题，是很难为EEG分析创建高效的学习模型的。为了解决这些挑战，所提出的防御框架利用了联邦学习范式，通过与来自分散源的本地化数据的协作模型训练来保护隐私，并引入基于声誉的机制来缓解数据污染攻击的影响和识别受损参与者。为了评估所提出的基于声誉的联邦学习防御框架的效率，基于数据训练的风险级别进行了数据污染攻击的实验。",
