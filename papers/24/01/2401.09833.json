    "translated_abstract": "在医学成像中，扫描通常会揭示出具有不同对比度但一致的内部强度或纹理的物体。这种特点使得可以利用低频逼近来进行分割和变形场估计等任务。然而，在医学图像分析的神经网络架构中融入这个概念仍然不够深入。在这篇论文中，我们提出了切片网络，一种设计用于利用这些特性的新型架构。切片网络包括一个编码器，利用视觉变换器等模型进行特征提取，和一个使用可学习双边网格的切片器，通过涂抹-模糊-切片的过程策略性地改进和上采样特征图。这引入了一个保留边缘的低频逼近，有效扩大了有效感受野。这种改进不仅减少了计算复杂性，还提高了整体性能。通过在不同医学成像应用上进行实验进行了验证。",
