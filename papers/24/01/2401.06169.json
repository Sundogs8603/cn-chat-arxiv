    "abstract": "Numerous prognostic factors are currently assessed histopathologically in biopsies of canine mast cell tumors to evaluate clinical behavior. In addition, PCR analysis of the c-Kit exon 11 mutational status is often performed to evaluate the potential success of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. This project aimed at training deep learning models (DLMs) to identify the c-Kit-11 mutational status of MCTs solely based on morphology without additional molecular analysis. HE slides of 195 mutated and 173 non-mutated tumors were stained consecutively in two different laboratories and scanned with three different slide scanners. This resulted in six different datasets (stain-scanner variations) of whole slide images. DLMs were trained with single and mixed datasets and their performances was assessed under scanner and staining domain shifts. The DLMs correctly classified HE slides according to their c-Kit 11 mutation status in, on average, 87% of cases for the best-suited stain-scanner var",

    "translated_abstract": "目前在犬肥大细胞瘤的活检组织中，通过组织病理学评估多种预后因子以评估临床行为。此外，常常通过c-Kit外显子11的PCR分析评估酪氨酸激酶抑制剂治疗的成功潜力。本研究旨在通过形态学而无需进一步的分子分析，训练深度学习模型（DLMs）识别MCTs的c-Kit-11突变状态。195例突变性和173例非突变性肿瘤的HE切片连续染色在两个不同的实验室并使用三种不同的切片扫描仪进行扫描。这产生了六个不同的数据集（染色-扫描仪变化）的整个切片图像。DLMs通过单一和混合数据集进行训练，并在扫描仪和染色领域转移下评估其性能。平均而言，DLMs可以正确分类HE切片的c-Kit 11突变状态，准确率达到87％。",
