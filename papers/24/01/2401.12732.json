    "translated_abstract": "跨领域推荐（CDR）已被证明是解决用户冷启动问题的一种有效方法，旨在通过从源领域转移用户偏好来为目标领域的用户进行推荐。传统的CDR研究遵循嵌入和映射（EMCDR）范 paradigm，通过学习一个用户共享映射函数将用户表示从源领域转移到目标领域，忽视了用户特定偏好。最近的CDR研究尝试在元学习范 paradigm 下学习用户特定映射函数，将每个用户的CDR视为独立任务，但忽视了用户之间的偏好相关性，限制了用于表示用户的有益信息。此外，这两个范 paradigm 都忽略了映射过程中来自两个领域的用户-项目显式交互。为了解决上述问题，本文提出了一种新的CDR框架，使用神经过程（NP），称为CDRNP。",
