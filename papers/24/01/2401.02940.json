    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种在Rydberg原子阵列上的混合数字-模拟量子学习算法，结合了量子学习的潜在实用性和近期可实现性以及中性原子的快速扩展架构。我们的构建只需在数字设置中进行单量子比特操作，并根据Rydberg哈密顿量进行模拟设置中的全局驱动。我们在经典和量子数据上进行了全面的数值研究，分别通过手写数字分类和无监督量子相边界学习来表示。我们在这两个典型问题中展示了数字-模拟学习不仅在近期是可行的，而且与数字学习方案相比，需要更短的电路深度，并且对于现实误差模型更具鲁棒性。我们的结果表明，在中期提高变分量子学习实验的效果方面，数字-模拟学习打开了一个有前景的道路。",

Compared to digital learning schemes, digital-analog learning requires shorter circuit depths and is more robust to realistic error models. This makes digital-analog learning a promising approach for improving variational quantum learning experiments in the mid-term."
