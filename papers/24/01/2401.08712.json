    "translated_abstract": "乳腺癌预后对于有效治疗至关重要，这种疾病在40岁以上的妇女中更为常见，但在40岁以下的妇女中罕见，美国只有不到5％的病例出现。研究表明，年轻妇女的预后较差，这种差异因种族而异。乳腺癌根据雌激素、孕激素和HER2等受体进行分类。三阴性乳腺癌（TNBC）缺乏这些受体，约占病例的15％，在年轻患者中更常见，通常导致较差的结果。然而，年龄对TNBC预后的影响尚不清楚。年龄、种族、肿瘤分级、大小和淋巴结状态等因素被研究其对TNBC临床结果的作用，但目前的研究对于年龄相关差异的结论不一致。本研究使用SEER数据集来研究年轻年龄对TNBC患者的存活能力的影响，旨在确定年龄是否是一个重要的预后因素。我们的实验结果表明，年轻年龄在TNBC患者的存活能力中有显著影响。",
