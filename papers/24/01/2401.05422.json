    "translated_abstract": "波束管理协议对于建立和维护网络无线电节点与用户设备(UEs)之间的连接至关重要。在分布式多输入多输出(D-MIMO)系统中，一些由中央处理单元(CPU)协调的接入点(AP)为一些UEs提供服务。在毫米波频段，由于需要发送下行(DL)参考信号来探测大量波束的问题，找到最佳的AP和波束以为UEs提供服务是具有挑战性的。本文的目标是通过仅对少量波束进行探测，并利用人工智能/机器学习推断最佳波束/AP是否可靠。我们使用随机森林(Random Forest), 缺失模式森林(MissForest)和条件生成对抗网络(conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, c-GAN)来展示推断的性能优势。",
