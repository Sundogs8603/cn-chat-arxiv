    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了两种用于具有未观测变量的因果可加模型（CAM-UV）的方法。CAM-UV假设因果函数采用广义可加模型的形式，并存在潜在的混淆变量。首先，我们提出了一种利用先验知识进行高效因果发现的方法。然后，我们扩展了这种方法，用于推断时间序列数据的因果关系。与其他现有的因果函数模型不同，原始的CAM-UV算法不寻求观测变量之间的因果顺序，而是旨在确定每个观测变量的原因。因此，本文中提出的第一种方法利用先验知识，例如理解某些变量不能成为特定变量的原因。此外，通过融入因果在时间上的先验知识，我们将第一个算法扩展为第二种用于时间序列数据中的因果发现的方法。我们验证了第一个提出的方法。",
