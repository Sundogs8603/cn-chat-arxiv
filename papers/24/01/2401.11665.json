    "abstract": "Approximate Thompson sampling with Langevin Monte Carlo broadens its reach from Gaussian posterior sampling to encompass more general smooth posteriors. However, it still encounters scalability issues in high-dimensional problems when demanding high accuracy. To address this, we propose an approximate Thompson sampling strategy, utilizing underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo, where the latter is the go-to workhorse for simulations of high-dimensional posteriors. Based on the standard smoothness and log-concavity conditions, we study the accelerated posterior concentration and sampling using a specific potential function. This design improves the sample complexity for realizing logarithmic regrets from $\\mathcal{\\tilde O}(d)$ to $\\mathcal{\\tilde O}(\\sqrt{d})$. The scalability and robustness of our algorithm are also empirically validated through synthetic experiments in high-dimensional bandit problems.",

    "translated_abstract": "使用欠阻尼 Langevin Monte Carlo 的近似 Thompson 采样方法扩展了其适用范围，从高斯后验采样扩展到更一般的平滑后验。然而，在高维问题中要求高准确性时，仍然面临可扩展性问题。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种近似 Thompson 采样策略，利用欠阻尼 Langevin Monte Carlo，后者是模拟高维后验的通用工具。基于标准的平滑性和对数凹性条件，我们研究了使用特定势函数的加速后验集中和采样。该设计改进了实现对数遗憾的样本复杂度，从$\\mathcal{\\tilde O}(d)$改进到$\\mathcal{\\tilde O}(\\sqrt{d})$。我们还通过合成实验在高维赌博机问题中经验验证了我们算法的可扩展性和鲁棒性。",
