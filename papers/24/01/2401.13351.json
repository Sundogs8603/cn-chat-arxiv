    "abstract": "Personalization generally improves the performance of queries but in a few cases it may also harms it. If we are able to predict and therefore to disable personalization for those situations, the overall performance will be higher and users will be more satisfied with personalized systems. We use some state-of-the-art pre-retrieval query performance predictors and propose some others including the user profile information for the previous purpose. We study the correlations among these predictors and the difference between the personalized and the original queries. We also use classification and regression techniques to improve the results and finally reach a bit more than one third of the maximum ideal performance. We think this is a good starting point within this research line, which certainly needs more effort and improvements.",

    "translated_abstract": "个性化通常可以提高查询性能，但在某些情况下可能会损害性能。如果我们能够预测并因此在这些情况下禁用个性化，整体性能将会更高，并且用户对个性化系统将更满意。我们使用一些最先进的预检索查询性能预测器，并提出一些新的预测器，包括先前目的的用户配置文件信息。我们研究了这些预测器之间的相关性以及个性化和原始查询之间的差异。我们还使用分类和回归技术来改进结果，并最终达到略高于最理想性能的三分之一。我们认为这是该研究领域一个良好的起点，当然还需要更多的努力和改进。",
