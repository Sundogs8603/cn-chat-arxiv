    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了DiffMoog - 一个具有商业乐器中常见模块的可微分模块化合成器。作为可微分的，它可以集成到神经网络中，实现自动化的声音匹配，以复制给定的音频输入。值得注意的是，DiffMoog具有调制能力（FM / AM）、低频振荡器（LFOs）、滤波器、包络形状器以及用户创建自定义信号链的能力。我们介绍了一个开源平台，该平台包括了DiffMoog和端到端的声音匹配框架。该框架利用了一种新颖的信号链损失和一个编码器网络，该网络根据用户定义的模块化架构来自动编程其输出，以预测DiffMoog的参数。此外，我们还提供了使用可微分合成进行声音匹配的见解和经验教训。通过将强大的声音功能与全面的平台结合，DiffMoog成为加快音频合成研究的首选资产。",
