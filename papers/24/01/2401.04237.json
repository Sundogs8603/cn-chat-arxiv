First, we employ a set of solved instances and configurations in order to learn a performance function of the solver. Secondly, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear program where the objective/constraints explicitly encode the learnt information, and which we solve, upon the arrival of an unknown instance, to find the best solver configuration for that instance, based on the performance function. The main novelty of our approach lies in the fact that the configuration set search problem is formulated as a mathematical program, which allows us to a) enforce hard dependence and compatibility constraints on the configurations, and b) solve it efficiently with off-the-shelf optimization tools.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出一种基于机器学习和优化的方法，用于选择给定实例的求解器配置。首先，我们利用一组已解决的实例和配置来学习求解器的性能函数。其次，我们制定了一个混合整数非线性规划，其中目标/约束明确地编码了学习到的信息，并且在未知实例到来时进行求解，以找到基于性能函数的最佳求解器配置。我们方法的主要创新在于将配置集查找问题形式化为数学程序，这使我们能够a)对配置强制执行依赖和兼容性约束，并b)利用即插即用的优化工具高效求解该问题。",
