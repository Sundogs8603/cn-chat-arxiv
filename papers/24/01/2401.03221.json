    "translated_abstract": "最近，文本到图像扩散模型成为图像处理领域的新范例，包括内容生成、图像恢复和图像到图像的翻译。给定一个目标提示，去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）能够生成逼真而合适的图像。凭借这个吸引人的特性，图像翻译任务有潜力在没有目标图像样本进行监督的情况下进行。通过使用目标文本提示进行领域自适应，扩散模型能够优势地实现零样本图像到图像的翻译。然而，DDPM的采样和反演过程是随机的，因此反演过程常常无法完全重构输入内容。具体而言，在扩散和反演过程中，位移效应会逐渐积累，导致重构结果偏离源域。为了使重构更加明确，我们提出了一种提示重新描述策略来实现镜像效应。",
