    "translated_abstract": "物联网的普及使得通信容量增加，成本降低，技术也得到了极大的发展。同时，大数据和实时数据分析变得越来越重要，并引起了市民、公共管理和其他组织之间分享数据的前所未有的兴趣，形成了协同物联网。但是，这种数据和基础设施的增长必须伴随着允许利用的软件架构。尽管有各种关注边缘、雾和/或云层上物联网利用的提议，但很难找到一种将这三个层次一起利用起来的软件解决方案，最大限度地利用每个层次的上下文和情境数据分析，并利用相邻层次之间的双向通信。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种解决边缘-雾-云计算中软件架构不足的方法，该架构可以有效利用上下文感知和情境数据分析，并实现相邻层次之间的双向通信。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes an architecture that addresses the limitations of software architecture in edge-fog-cloud computing, enabling effective utilization of contextual awareness and situational data analysis, as well as facilitating bidirectional communication between adjacent tiers."
