    "translated_abstract": "呼吸频率（RR）是各种医疗情况的指标，如心血管疾病和睡眠障碍。目前的RR估计方法大多设计用于指甲基础PPG在静态情况下收集的数据（如在医院）。与指甲基础的PPG信号不同，基于手腕的PPG更容易受到噪音的影响，特别是在低频范围内，其中包括呼吸信息。因此，在自由生活条件下收集从手腕区域获取的PPG数据时，现有方法往往难以准确提取RR。智能手表的普及，配备了包括PPG、加速度计和陀螺仪在内的各种传感器，迫使人们需要一种鲁棒的RR估计方法。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于卷积神经网络的方法，从智能手表捕获的PPG、加速度计和陀螺仪信号中提取RR。我们的方法包括扩张残余引入模块和一维卷积，从中提取时间信息。",
