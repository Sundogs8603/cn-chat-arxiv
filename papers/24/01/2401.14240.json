    "abstract": "Depression is a global burden and one of the most challenging mental health conditions to control. Experts can detect its severity early using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaire, administer appropriate medication to patients, and impede its progression. Due to the fear of potential stigmatization, many patients turn to social media platforms like Reddit for advice and assistance at various stages of their journey. This research extracts text from Reddit to facilitate the diagnostic process. It employs a proposed labeling approach to categorize the text and subsequently fine-tunes the Longformer model. The model's performance is compared against baseline models, including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting. Our findings reveal that the Longformer model outperforms the baseline models in both English (48%) and Luganda (45%) languages on a custom-made dataset.",

    "translated_abstract": "抑郁症是全球负担重的、难以控制的心理健康问题之一。专家们可以使用贝克抑郁量表（BDI）问卷早期检测其严重程度，给患者施用适当药物，阻止其进展。由于担心可能的污名化，许多患者转向Reddit等社交媒体平台寻求建议和帮助。本研究从Reddit提取文本以促进诊断过程。它采用了一种提出的标注方法对文本进行分类，并随后对Longformer模型进行了细调。将该模型与基准模型进行了比较，包括朴素贝叶斯、随机森林、支持向量机和梯度提升。我们的研究结果显示，Longformer模型在英语（48%）和卢干达语（45%）的自定义数据集上优于基准模型。",
