    "translated_abstract": "本文严格研究了图神经分数阶微分方程(FDE)模型的鲁棒性。该框架通过实施分数阶Caputo导数，超越了传统的图神经整数阶常微分方程(ODE)模型。利用分数阶微积分，我们的模型在特征更新过程中考虑了长期记忆，与传统图神经ODE模型中的无记忆马尔可夫更新不同。图神经FDE模型相对于图神经ODE模型在没有攻击或扰动的环境中已经被证明具有优势。尽管传统的图神经ODE模型在现有文献中已经被验证在存在对抗性攻击时具有一定的稳定性和弹性，但图神经FDE模型的鲁棒性，特别是在对抗性条件下的表现，仍未得到广泛探究。本文对图神经FDE模型的鲁棒性进行了详细评估。",
