    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们解决了在混合表格和文本数据上进行问答的问题，这在Web上非常常见（如SEC文件），通常需要离散推理能力。最近，像GPT-4这样的大型语言模型展示了强大的多步骤推理能力。我们考虑利用LLMs的强大能力来解决我们的任务。我们提出了面向表格和文本问答的分步流水线的抽象，包括提取器、推理器和执行器三个关键步骤，并首先设计了一份指令来实例化该流水线并验证GPT-4优于所有现有方法。然而，利用像GPT-4这样的在线LLM存在成本、延迟和数据安全风险等各种挑战，这促使我们专门针对此任务开发较小的LLM。我们通过对现有专家标注数据集自动生成的训练数据对LLaMA 2进行微调，开发了TAT-LLM语言模型。",
