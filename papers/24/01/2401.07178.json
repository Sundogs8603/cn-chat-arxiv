    "abstract": "We study the dynamics of opinions in a setting where a leader has a payoff that depends on agents' beliefs and where agents derive psychological utility from their beliefs. Agents sample a signal that maximises their utility and then communicate with each other through a network formed by disjoint social groups. The leader has a choice to target a finite set of social groups with a specific signal to influence their beliefs and maximise his returns. Heterogeneity in agents' preferences allows us to analyse the evolution of opinions as a dynamical system with asymmetric forces. We apply our model to explain the emergence of hatred and the spread of racism in a society. We show that when information is restricted, the equilibrium level of hatred is determined solely by the belief of the most extremist agent in the group regardless of the inherent structure of the network. On the contrary, when information is dense, the space is completely polarised in equilibrium with the presence of mul",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了意见在一个环境中的动态变化，其中领导者的回报取决于代理人的信念，而代理人从他们的信念中获得心理效用。代理人通过由不同的社交群体形成的网络与彼此进行通信。领导者可以选择针对一组具体信号的社交群体，并影响他们的信念来最大化他的回报。代理人偏好的异质性使我们能够将意见的演变分析为具有非对称力量的动力系统。我们将我们的模型应用于解释社会中仇恨的产生和种族主义的传播。我们发现当信息受限时，仇恨的平衡水平仅由群体中最极端代理人的信念决定，而与网络的内在结构无关。相反，当信息丰富时，空间在平衡状态下完全极化，并伴有多的存在。",
