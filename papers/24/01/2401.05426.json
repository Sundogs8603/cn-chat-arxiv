    "translated_abstract": "最近神经网络技术的进步显著提高了利用多个时间序列传感器进行人体活动识别的效果。虽然使用大量传感器和高采样率通常可以提高结果，但往往会导致数据低效和人工神经网络的不必要扩展，给在边缘设备上的实际应用带来挑战。为了应对这些问题，我们的工作引入了一个实用的框架，用于在HAR任务中的数据高效利用，同时考虑传感器模态和采样率的优化。我们方法的核心是设计的可训练参数，称为“权重分数”，它们评估训练阶段中每个传感器模态和采样率的重要性。这些分数指导传感器模态和采样率的选择。修剪方法允许用户在计算预算和性能之间进行权衡，根据选择传感器模态和采样率。",
