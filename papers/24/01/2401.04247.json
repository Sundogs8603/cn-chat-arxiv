    "translated_abstract": "图像水印对于追踪图像来源和声明所有权非常重要。随着生成模型（如稳定扩散）的出现，能够创建虚假但逼真的图像，水印成为了尤为重要的任务，例如使生成的图像可靠地辨认出来。然而，正是这种稳定扩散技术可以移除使用现有方法注入的水印。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种名为ZoDiac的方法，它使用预训练的稳定扩散模型将水印注入到可训练的潜在空间中，从而在受攻击时仍然可以可靠地在潜在向量中检测到水印。我们在三个基准数据集 MS-COCO、DiffusionDB 和 WikiArt 上评估了 ZoDiac，并发现 ZoDiac 对于最先进的水印攻击具有很强的鲁棒性，水印检测率超过98%，误报率低于6.4%，优于现有的水印方法。我们的研究表明，稳定扩散是一种有前途的方法。",
