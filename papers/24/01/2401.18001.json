    "translated_abstract": "先前的研究揭示了现有先进的基于上下文的问题回答（QA）系统中存在的一系列共同问题：当上下文与模型的参数化知识冲突时，缺乏对上下文的关注，对噪声的鲁棒性很小，并且回答的一致性不足。然而，大多数先前的工作都集中在单独解决其中一两个问题上，这使得很难看到它们之间的趋势。我们旨在填补这一空白，首先概述QA模型的一系列 - 先前讨论过的和新的 - 期望。然后，我们通过调查相关的分析和方法论文，提供领域现状的概述。我们的工作的第二部分展示了实验，在5个数据集上同时按照所有期望评估了15个QA系统。我们发现了许多新的趋势，包括（1）对噪声较不敏感的系统在提供无关上下文时不一定更一致地回答问题；（2）大多数对噪声敏感的系统...",
