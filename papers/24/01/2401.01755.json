    "abstract": "Parallel text-to-speech models have been widely applied for real-time speech synthesis, and they offer more controllability and a much faster synthesis process compared with conventional auto-regressive models. Although parallel models have benefits in many aspects, they become naturally unfit for incremental synthesis due to their fully parallel architecture such as transformer. In this work, we propose Incremental FastPitch, a novel FastPitch variant capable of incrementally producing high-quality Mel chunks by improving the architecture with chunk-based FFT blocks, training with receptive-field constrained chunk attention masks, and inference with fixed size past model states. Experimental results show that our proposal can produce speech quality comparable to the parallel FastPitch, with a significant lower latency that allows even lower response time for real-time speech applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "并行的文本到语音模型在实时语音合成中得到了广泛应用，与传统的自回归模型相比，它们具有更多的可控性和更快的合成过程。尽管并行模型在许多方面都有优势，但由于其完全并行的架构（如transformer），它们在增量合成方面自然无法适应。在这项工作中，我们提出了增量式FastPitch，它是一种改进架构的FastPitch变体，能够通过改进的分块FFT块进行增量生成高质量的Mel块，通过受限接受域的分块注意力掩码进行训练，并通过固定大小的过去模型状态进行推理。实验结果表明，我们的提议能够产生与并行FastPitch相当的语音质量，同时具有显著更低的延迟，可以在实时语音应用中实现更低的响应时间。",
