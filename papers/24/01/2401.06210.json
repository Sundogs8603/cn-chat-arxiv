    "abstract": "Document representation is the core of many NLP tasks on machine understanding. A general representation learned in an unsupervised manner reserves generality and can be used for various applications. In practice, sentiment analysis (SA) has been a challenging task that is regarded to be deeply semantic-related and is often used to assess general representations. Existing methods on unsupervised document representation learning can be separated into two families: sequential ones, which explicitly take the ordering of words into consideration, and non-sequential ones, which do not explicitly do so. However, both of them suffer from their own weaknesses. In this paper, we propose a model that overcomes difficulties encountered by both families of methods. Experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular SA datasets and a fine-grained aspect-based SA by a large margin.",

    "translated_abstract": "文档表示是机器理解中许多自然语言处理任务的核心。以无监督方式学习的一般表示保留了通用性，可用于各种应用。在实践中，情感分析（SA）是一个挑战性的任务，被认为与语义密切相关，并经常用于评估一般表示。现有的无监督文档表示学习方法可以分为两类：序列方法（显式考虑单词的顺序）和非序列方法（不显式考虑顺序）。然而，它们都有各自的缺点。在本文中，我们提出了一个模型，克服了这两类方法遇到的困难。实验证明，我们的模型在流行的SA数据集和细粒度的基于方面的SA上优于现有的最先进方法。",
