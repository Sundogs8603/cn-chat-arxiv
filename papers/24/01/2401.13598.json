    "translated_abstract": "文档级关系三元组抽取（DocRTE）是信息系统中的一个基本任务，旨在从文档中同时提取带有语义关系的实体。现有的方法严重依赖大量标记完整的数据。然而，收集和注释新出现的关系的数据耗时且劳动密集。最近的先进大型语言模型（LLMs），如ChatGPT和LLaMA，展现了令人印象深刻的长文本生成能力，启发我们探索一种用于获取具有新关系的自动标记文档的替代方法。在本文中，我们提出了一个零样本文档级关系三元组抽取（ZeroDocRTE）框架，该框架通过从LLMs中检索和去噪知识来生成标记数据，称为GenRDK。具体而言，我们提出了一种检索提示链以指导ChatGPT逐步生成标记的长文本数据。为了提高合成数据的质量，我们提出了一种基于去噪策略的方法",
