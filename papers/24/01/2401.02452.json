    "translated_abstract": "工业和学术人工智能实验室在使用计算资源方面存在明显差异。我们提供了一项数据驱动的调查，以了解计算分歧对机器学习研究的影响。我们表明，计算分歧与计算密集型研究主题中学术独立研究团队的表示减少有关，特别是基础模型方面。我们认为，学术界在推进相关技术、提供关键的评估和审查以及在这些模型的传播方面可能发挥的作用将较小。与研究重心的这种变化同时，学术研究在倡导工业界开发的开源、预训练模型方面出现了明显转变。为了应对这一趋势所带来的挑战，尤其是对影响力模型的审查减少，我们建议采取一些方法来有针对性地拓展学术见解。这些方法包括国家支持的计算基础设施与开放科学倡议的结合。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the impact of compute divide on academic contribution and scrutiny in machine learning research. It reveals that the compute divide results in reduced academic influence in computationally intensive research topics and a shift towards the use of open source, pre-trained models developed by industry. To address this issue, the paper suggests expanding academic insights through the combination of nationally-sponsored computing infrastructure and open science initiatives."
