    "abstract": "The capabilities of the most recent language models have increased the interest in integrating them into real-world applications. However, the fact that these models generate plausible, yet incorrect text poses a constraint when considering their use in several domains. Healthcare is a prime example of a domain where text-generative trustworthiness is a hard requirement to safeguard patient well-being. In this paper, we present Physio, a chat-based application for physical rehabilitation. Physio is capable of making an initial diagnosis while citing reliable health sources to support the information provided. Furthermore, drawing upon external knowledge databases, Physio can recommend rehabilitation exercises and over-the-counter medication for symptom relief. By combining these features, Physio can leverage the power of generative models for language processing while also conditioning its response on dependable and verifiable sources. A live demo of Physio is available at https://phys",

    "translated_abstract": "最新语言模型的能力增加了将它们整合到实际应用中的兴趣。然而，这些模型生成的合理但不正确的文本事实在考虑在几个领域使用它们时会造成限制。医疗保健是一个要求文本生成可信度的领域的典型例子，以保障患者的健康。在本文中，我们介绍了Physio，一种用于物理康复的基于聊天的应用程序。Physio能够进行初步诊断，并引用可靠的健康来源来支持提供的信息。此外，Physio还可以借助外部知识数据库推荐康复运动和非处方药物以缓解症状。通过结合这些功能，Physio可以利用生成模型进行语言处理，同时将其回复条件化为可靠和可验证的来源。Physio的在线演示可在https://phys访问。",
