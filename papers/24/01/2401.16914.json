The analogy between lattices and graphs enables the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) as a faster surrogate model compared to traditional methods such as finite element modelling. In this work we present a higher-order GNN model trained to predict the fourth-order stiffness tensor of periodic strut-based lattices. The key features of the model are (i) SE(3) equivariance, and (ii) consistency with the thermodynamic law of conservation of energy. We compare the model to non-equivariant models based on a number of error metrics and demonstrate the benefits of the encoded equivariance and energy conservation in terms of predictive performance and reduced training requirements.",

    "translated_abstract": "格子是一种结构化的亚波长型材料，其性质强烈依赖于其几何设计。格子和图之间的类比使得可以使用图神经网络（GNN）作为一个比传统方法（如有限元建模）更快速的替代模型。本文提出了一个高阶GNN模型，用于预测周期性支撑结构的四阶刚度张量。该模型的关键特点是（i）SE（3）等变性和（ii）能量守恒定律的一致性。我们通过一些误差度量指标将该模型与非等变模型进行比较，展示了编码的等变性和能量守恒在预测性能和减少训练需求方面的好处。",
