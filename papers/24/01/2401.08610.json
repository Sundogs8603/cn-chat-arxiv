    "translated_abstract": "Lido是以太坊上最主要的Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD)提供商，允许用户抵押任意数量的ETH来获得stETH，这可以与DeFi协议如Aave进行整合。Lido与Aave之间的互通性使得一种新型策略“杠杆质押”得以实现，用户在Lido上质押ETH获取stETH，将stETH作为Aave上的抵押品借入ETH，然后将借入的ETH重新投入Lido。用户可以迭代执行此过程，根据自己的风险偏好来优化潜在回报。本文系统地研究了杠杆质押所涉及的机会和风险。我们是第一个在Lido-Aave生态系统中对杠杆质押策略进行形式化的研究。我们的经验研究发现，在以太坊上有262个杠杆质押头寸，总质押金额为295,243 ETH（482M USD）。我们发现，90.13%的杠杆质押头寸实现了比传统质押更高的回报。",
