    "abstract": "In the information age we are living in today, not only are we interested in accessing multimedia objects such as documents, videos, etc. but also in searching for professional experts, people or celebrities, possibly for professional needs or just for fun. Information access systems need to be able to extract and exploit various sources of information (usually in text format) about such individuals, and to represent them in a suitable way usually in the form of a profile. In this article, we tackle the problems of profile-based expert recommendation and document filtering from a machine learning perspective by clustering expert textual sources to build profiles and capture the different hidden topics in which the experts are interested. The experts will then be represented by means of multi-faceted profiles. Our experiments show that this is a valid technique to improve the performance of expert finding and document filtering.",

    "translated_abstract": "在当今的信息时代，我们不仅对访问文档、视频等多媒体对象感兴趣，还对搜索专业专家、人物或名人感兴趣，可能是出于职业需求或只是为了娱乐。信息访问系统需要能够提取和利用关于这些个人的各种信息来源（通常以文本形式），并以适当的方式呈现，通常以个人资料的形式。本文从机器学习的角度，通过对专家文本来源进行聚类来构建个人资料并捕捉专家感兴趣的不同隐藏主题，从而解决基于个人资料的专家推荐和文档过滤问题。实验证明，这是一种有效的技术，可以提高专家查找和文档过滤的性能。",
