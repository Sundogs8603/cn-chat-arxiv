    "translated_abstract": "大流行，特别是最近的COVID-19疫情爆发，对公共卫生和全球经济产生了影响。因此，我们需要深入了解疾病发展趋势和高效的应对策略，以应对潜在的未来疫情爆发。本文强调了代理人模型（Agent-Based Models，ABM）在捕捉复杂的感染动态和理解干预措施影响的潜力。我们模拟了反映现实政策采纳中的挑战的真实药物、行为和数字干预，并提出了这些干预的整体组合用于大流行疫情应对。通过这些模拟，我们根据华盛顿州金斯县的真实社会人口统计数据和地理普查数据，研究了大规模人口的新兴行为趋势。我们的分析揭示了最初100天在决定大流行疫情走势方面的关键作用，强调了快速决策和高效政策制定的重要性。",
