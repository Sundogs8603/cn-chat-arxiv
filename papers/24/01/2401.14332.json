    "translated_abstract": "随着越来越多的物联网设备进入家庭，潜在的信息泄漏渠道以及相关的安全威胁和隐私风险也在增加。尽管在无保护的家庭网络中存在对物联网设备的长期攻击历史，但准确、快速地检测和预防此类攻击的问题仍然存在。许多现有的物联网保护解决方案是基于云的，有时效果不佳，并且可能与未知第三方共享消费者数据。本文研究了在家庭路由器上使用人工智能工具结合经典基于规则的流量过滤算法来有效检测物联网威胁的潜力。我们的结果表明，通过机器学习和流量过滤逻辑导致路由器硬件资源略微增加，装备我们的解决方案的典型家庭路由器能够有效检测风险并保护典型的家庭物联网网络，与现有的流行解决方案相当或优于其性能。",
