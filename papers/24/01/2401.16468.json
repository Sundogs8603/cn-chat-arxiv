    "translated_abstract": "图像恢复是一个基本问题，涉及从退化观测中恢复出高质量的干净图像。全能图像恢复模型可以通过使用特定于退化类型的信息作为提示来有效地恢复各种类型和级别的退化图像，并引导恢复模型。我们提出了一种使用人类编写的指令来指导图像恢复模型的方法。在给定自然语言提示的情况下，我们的模型可以从退化图像中恢复出高质量的图像，并考虑多种退化类型。我们的方法InstructIR在图像去噪、雨水去除、去模糊、去雾和(低光)图像增强等多个恢复任务上取得了最先进的结果。InstructIR在之前的全能恢复方法上提高了1dB。此外，我们的数据集和结果为基于文本指导的图像恢复和增强的新研究提供了一个新的基准。我们提供了代码、数据集和模型。",
