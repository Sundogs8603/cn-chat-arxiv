    "abstract": "In recent studies, the focus has been on enhancing knowledge graph embedding learning, which encodes entities and relations in knowledge graphs into low-dimensional vector spaces. While current models mainly consider the structural aspects of these graphs, there's a wealth of contextual and literal information in knowledge graphs that can be utilized for more effective embeddings. This paper introduces a novel model that incorporates both contextual and literal information into entity and relation embeddings, utilizing graph convolutional networks. Specifically, for contextual information, we assess its significance through confidence and relatedness metrics. A unique rule-based method is developed to calculate the confidence metric, and the relatedness metric is derived from the literal information's representations. We validated our model's performance with thorough experiments on two established benchmark datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "在最近的研究中，关注点主要集中在增强知识图谱嵌入学习上，该学习将知识图谱中的实体和关系编码为低维向量空间。尽管当前模型主要考虑这些图谱的结构方面，但在知识图谱中存在着丰富的上下文和字面信息，可以用于更有效的嵌入学习。本文引入了一种新型模型，该模型将上下文和字面信息容纳到实体和关系的嵌入中，利用图卷积网络。具体地，对于上下文信息，我们通过置信度和相关性指标评估其重要性。我们开发了一种独特的基于规则的方法来计算置信度指标，并从字面信息的表示中得出相关性指标。我们通过对两个已建立的基准数据集进行详尽的实验证实了我们模型的性能。",
