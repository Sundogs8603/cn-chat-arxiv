    "abstract": "Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a prevalent chronic disease with a significant risk of serious health complications and negative impacts on the quality of life. Given the impact of individual characteristics and lifestyle on the treatment plan and patient outcomes, it is crucial to develop precise and personalized management strategies. Artificial intelligence (AI) provides great promise in combining patterns from various data sources with nurses' expertise to achieve optimal care. Methods: This is a 6-month ancillary study among T2D patients (n = 20, age = 57 +- 10). Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention (AI, n=10) group to receive daily AI-generated individualized feedback or a control group without receiving the daily feedback (non-AI, n=10) in the last three months. The study developed an online nurse-in-the-loop predictive control (ONLC) model that utilizes a predictive digital twin (PDT). The PDT was developed using a transfer-learning-based Artificial Neura",

    "translated_abstract": "背景：2型糖尿病（T2D）是一种常见的慢性疾病，其会增加严重健康并对生活质量产生负面影响。考虑到个体特征和生活方式对治疗计划和患者结果的影响，开发精确和个性化的管理策略至关重要。人工智能（AI）结合来自各种数据源的模式和护士的专业知识，可以实现最佳护理效果。方法：这是一项针对T2D患者（n = 20，年龄= 57+-10）的为期6个月的附属研究。参与者随机分配为干预组（AI，n = 10）和对照组，在最后三个月中干预组每天接收AI生成的个体化反馈，而对照组不接收每日反馈（非AI，n = 10）。研究开发了一种在线护士参与型预测控制模型（ONLC），该模型利用预测数字孪生体（PDT）。PDT是通过基于转移学习的人工神经网络训练的。",
