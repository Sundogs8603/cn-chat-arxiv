    "translated_abstract": "全息元表面收发器（HMT）正以经济实惠的方式成为毫米和太赫兹波通信中波束成型的替代品。然而，在HMT中通过波束成型实现所需信道增益需要适当设置大量元素的相移，这是具有挑战性的。此外，这些最佳相移依赖于接收器位置，这可能是未知的。在本文中，我们使用{\\it 固定预算多臂老虎机算法}开发了一个学习算法，以在远场区域进行波束成型并最大化接收信号强度。我们的算法名为 \\Algo，利用了波束的通道增益参数形式，它可以用两个{\\it 相移参数}表示。即使进行参数化，问题仍然具有挑战性，因为相移参数采用连续值。为了克服这个问题，\\HB 使用相移参数的离散值并利用其子结构。",
