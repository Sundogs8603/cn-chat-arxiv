    "abstract": "We examine the impact of Islamic legal institutions to the comparative economic decline of the Middle East behind Latin Europe, which can be observed since the late Middle Ages. To this end, we explore whether the sacralization of Islamic law and its focus on the Sharia as supreme, sacred and unchangeable legal text, which reached its culmination in the 13th century had an impact on economic development. We use the population size of 145 cities in Islamic countries and 648 European cities for the period 800-1800 as proxies for the level of economic development, and construct novel estimates of the number of law schools (i.e. madaris) and estimate their contribution to the pre-industrial economic development. Our triple-differences estimates show that a higher density of madrasas before the sacralization of Islamic law predicts a more vibrant urban economy characterized by higher urban growth.

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究伊斯兰法律制度对中东与拉丁欧洲之间比较经济衰退的影响，这可以从中世纪后期开始观察。为此，我们探讨了伊斯兰法律的神圣化以及其对伊斯兰教法的崇高、神圣和不可改变的法律文本的关注，这在13世纪达到顶峰，对经济发展产生了影响。我们使用145个伊斯兰国家的城市人口和648个欧洲城市的数据作为经济发展水平的代理，并构建了关于法学院（madaris）数量的新估计，并估计它们对前工业时期经济发展的贡献。我们的三重差分估计结果表明，在伊斯兰法律神圣化之前，法学院的高密度与更加充满活力的城市经济和更高的城市增长相关。在13世纪伊斯兰教法神圣化巩固之后，更高密度的法学院不再对城市发展产生显著影响。",

It finds that a higher density of law schools before the sacralization of Islamic law is associated with a more vibrant urban economy and higher urban growth."
