    "abstract": "The explosive and widespread growth of data necessitates the use of text classification to extract crucial information from vast amounts of data. Consequently, there has been a surge of research in both classical and deep learning text classification methods. Despite the numerous methods proposed in the literature, there is still a pressing need for a comprehensive and up-to-date survey. Existing survey papers categorize algorithms for text classification into broad classes, which can lead to the misclassification of unrelated algorithms and incorrect assessments of their qualities and behaviors using the same metrics. To address these limitations, our paper introduces a novel methodological taxonomy that classifies algorithms hierarchically into fine-grained classes and specific techniques. The taxonomy includes methodology categories, methodology techniques, and methodology sub-techniques. Our study is the first survey to utilize this methodological taxonomy for classifying algorithm",

    "translated_abstract": "数据的爆炸性和广泛增长使得使用文本分类从大量数据中提取关键信息成为必要。因此，对于经典和深度学习的文本分类方法的研究出现了激增。尽管文献中提出了许多方法，但仍然迫切需要一份全面和最新的综述。现有的综述文章将文本分类算法分为广泛的类别，这可能导致对无关算法的错误分类，以及使用相同度量标准对其质量和行为进行错误评估。为了解决这些局限性，我们的论文引入了一种新颖的方法分类法，将算法层次化地分为精细的类别和具体技术。该分类法包括方法学类别、方法学技术和方法学子技术。我们的研究是首次利用这种方法分类法对算法进行分类的调查。",
