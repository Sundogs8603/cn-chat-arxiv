    "translated_abstract": "人工智能尤其是大型语言模型和生成式人工智能的迅速发展，为在各个领域中的应用开辟了新的途径，然而其在商业教育中的作用仍未得到充分探索。本研究引入了首个基准来评估七个重要的大型语言模型，包括OpenAI的模型（GPT-3.5 Turbo、GPT-4和GPT-4 Turbo）、Google的模型（PaLM 2、Gemini 1.0 Pro）和Anthropic的模型（Claude 2和Claude 2.1），在GMAT考试上的表现。我们的分析显示，大多数语言模型优于人类考生，其中GPT-4 Turbo不仅在其他模型之上，而且超过了顶级商学院研究生的平均分数。通过一个案例研究，本研究考察了GPT-4 Turbo在解释答案、评估回答、识别错误、调整指导和生成替代场景方面的能力。",
