    "translated_abstract": "视频问答（VideoQA）旨在基于观察到的视频信息回答自然语言问题。尽管大型多模型（LMMs）在图像语言理解和推理方面取得了近期的成功，但它们在处理视频问答方面还不足够，仅仅是将均匀采样的帧作为视觉输入，忽略了与问题相关的视觉线索。此外，现有的视频问答数据集中没有针对问题关键时间戳的人工注释。基于此，我们提出了一种新的弱监督框架，强制LMMs使用问题关键时刻作为视觉输入推理出答案。具体来说，我们将问题和答案对合并为事件描述，以找到多个关键帧作为目标时刻，这些时刻将作为伪标签。通过将这些伪标签作为额外的弱监督，我们设计了一个轻量级的基于高斯的对比基础模块（GCG）。GCG学习多个高斯函数来描述时效结构。",

By fusing question and answer pairs as event descriptions, multiple keyframes are identified as target moments and used as pseudo-labels to enforce reasoning in the multimodal models. The proposed method utilizes a lightweight Gaussian-based contrastive grounding module to learn temporal structure."
