    "abstract": "We explore the social and contextual factors that influence the outcome of person-to-person music recommendations and discovery. Specifically, we use data from Spotify to investigate how a link sent from one user to another results in the receiver engaging with the music of the shared artist. We consider several factors that may influence this process, such as the strength of the sender-receiver relationship, the user's role in the Spotify social network, their music social cohesion, and how similar the new artist is to the receiver's taste. We find that the receiver of a link is more likely to engage with a new artist when (1) they have similar music taste to the sender and the shared track is a good fit for their taste, (2) they have a stronger and more intimate tie with the sender, and (3) the shared artist is popular with the receiver's connections. Finally, we use these findings to build a Random Forest classifier to predict whether a shared music track will result in the receiver",

    "translated_abstract": "我们探讨影响个人之间音乐推荐和发现结果的社交和环境因素。具体来说，我们使用 Spotify 的数据来研究用户之间发送链接导致接收者与分享的艺术家的音乐互动。我们考虑了几个可能影响这一过程的因素，如发送者与接收者的关系强度，用户在 Spotify 社交网络中的角色，他们的音乐社交凝聚力，以及新艺术家与接收者的品味相似程度。我们发现，当接收者与发送者的音乐品味相似且分享的音轨适合他们的品味时，他们更有可能与新艺术家互动；当他们与发送者有更强和更亲密的联系时，也更有可能互动；以及当分享的艺术家在接收者的关系中受欢迎时，也更有可能互动。最后，我们利用这些发现构建了一个随机森林分类器，用于预测分享的音乐轨道是否会导致接收者的互动。",
