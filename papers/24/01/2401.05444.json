    "translated_abstract": "借助特殊的神经形态硬件，脉冲神经网络（SNN）被期望能以较低能量消耗实现人工智能（AI）。通过将SNN与深度强化学习（DRL）结合，为现实控制任务提供了一种有前景的高能效方式。本文针对代理需要学习多维确定性策略以进行控制的任务进行研究，这在真实场景中非常常见。最近，替代梯度方法已被用于训练多层SNN，在这个任务中允许SNNs实现与对应深度网络相当的性能。大多数现有的基于脉冲的RL方法将脉冲频率作为SNN的输出，并通过全连接（FC）层将其转换为表示连续动作空间（即确定性策略）。然而，脉冲频率的十进制特性使得FC层需要浮点矩阵运算，使得整个SNN无法部署。",
