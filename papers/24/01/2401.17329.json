    "translated_abstract": "自适应巡航控制（ACC）是一种可以减少汽车工业中燃料消耗和空气污染的技术。然而，与工业化国家相比，伊朗的ACC可用性较低。本研究调查了伊朗驾驶员对ACC的接受度和愿意支付程度。通过对453名受访者的在线调查数据进行技术接受模型（TAM）和有序logit模型的分析，结果显示感知易用性和感知有用性影响对使用ACC的态度，而这些态度进一步影响行为意图。logit模型还显示，那些认为ACC易用且有用、车辆价格较高、有巡航控制（CC）经验的女性驾驶员更有可能支付ACC的费用。为了在伊朗增加ACC的采用率，建议针对早期采用者，尤其是女性和资本家，他们可以通过积极的反馈影响其他人。ACC对交通安全和环境的益处可以加以强调。",
