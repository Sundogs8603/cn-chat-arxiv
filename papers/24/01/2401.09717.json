    "abstract": "The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex, challenging task as it depends on the analysis of interactional behaviors by psychologists rather than the use of biochemical diagnostics. In this paper, we present a modeling approach to ASD diagnosis by analyzing acoustic/prosodic and linguistic features extracted from diagnostic conversations between a psychologist and children who either are typically developing (TD) or have ASD. We compare the contributions of different features across a range of conversation tasks. We focus on finding a minimal set of parameters that characterize conversational behaviors of children with ASD. Because ASD is diagnosed through conversational interaction, in addition to analyzing the behavior of the children, we also investigate whether the psychologist's conversational behaviors vary across diagnostic groups. Our results can facilitate fine-grained analysis of conversation data for children with ASD to support diagnosis and intervention.",

    "translated_abstract": "自闭症谱系障碍(ASD)的诊断是一项复杂而具有挑战性的任务，它依赖于心理学家对互动行为的分析，而不是生化诊断的使用。本文提出了一种通过分析心理学家与典型发育或有ASD的儿童之间诊断性对话中提取的声学/韵律和语言特征来进行ASD诊断的建模方法。我们比较了不同特征在一系列对话任务中的贡献。我们的重点是找到一组最小的参数来描述ASD儿童的谈话行为。由于ASD是通过对话互动进行诊断的，除了分析儿童的行为外，我们还调查了心理学家的对话行为在不同诊断群体之间是否有变化。我们的结果可以促进对ASD儿童的谈话数据进行细致分析，以支持诊断和干预。",
