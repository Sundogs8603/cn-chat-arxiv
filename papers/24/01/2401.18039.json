    "translated_abstract": "在多变量分析中，经典的Na\\\"ive Bayes分类方法已被证明是一种易于处理和高效的方法。然而，特征通常是相关的，这违反了Na\\\"ive Bayes条件独立性的假设，可能会损害该方法的性能。此外，数据集通常具有大量的特征，这可能会使结果的解释变得复杂，并减慢该方法的执行。在本文中，我们提出了一种稀疏版本的Na\\\"ive Bayes分类器，它具有三个特点。首先，通过考虑协变量的相关结构实现了稀疏性。其次，可以使用不同的性能度量来指导特征的选择。第三，可以包括对更感兴趣的组别的性能约束。我们的提案可以实现智能搜索，具有竞争力的运行时间，同时在分类的性能度量方面具有灵活性。",
