    "translated_abstract": "贝叶斯神经网络（BayNNs）可以内在地估计预测的不确定性，方便决策制定。基于Dropout的BayNNs越来越多地应用于自旋电子学计算内存架构中，用于资源受限但性能要求高的安全关键应用。尽管不确定性估计很重要，但现有的工作忽视了Dropout生成和BayNN计算的可靠性对于目标应用同样重要。然而，与传统的神经网络相比，测试BayNNs更具挑战性，因为它们具有随机性质。在本文中，我们首次提出了基于自旋电子学Dropout模块的非理想性模型，并分析了它们对不确定性估计和准确性的影响。此外，我们还提出了一种基于可重复性排名的测试框架，用于Dropout-based BayNN，可以达到100%的故障覆盖率，同时仅使用0.2%的训练数据作为测试向量。",
