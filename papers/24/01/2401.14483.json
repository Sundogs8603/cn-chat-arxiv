    "abstract": "Machine learning is about forecasting. Forecasts, however, obtain their usefulness only through their evaluation. Machine learning has traditionally focused on types of losses and their corresponding regret. Currently, the machine learning community regained interest in calibration. In this work, we show the conceptual equivalence of calibration and regret in evaluating forecasts. We frame the evaluation problem as a game between a forecaster, a gambler and nature. Putting intuitive restrictions on gambler and forecaster, calibration and regret naturally fall out of the framework. In addition, this game links evaluation of forecasts to randomness of outcomes. Random outcomes with respect to forecasts are equivalent to good forecasts with respect to outcomes. We call those dual aspects, calibration and regret, predictiveness and randomness, the four facets of forecast felicity.",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习是关于预测的。然而，预测只有经过评估后才具有其有用性。机器学习传统上关注损失类型及其相应的遗憾。目前，机器学习社区重新对校准产生了兴趣。在这项工作中，我们展示了校准和遗憾在评估预测中的概念等价性。我们将评估问题构建为一个预测者、一个赌徒和自然之间的博弈。通过对赌徒和预测者施加直观的限制，校准和遗憾自然地成为了这个框架的一部分。此外，这个博弈将预测的评估与结果的随机性联系起来。相对于预测而言，结果的随机性等同于关于结果的好的预测。我们称这两个方面为校准和遗憾、预测性和随机性，即预测的四个方面。",
