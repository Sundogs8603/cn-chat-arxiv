    "translated_abstract": "对于PDE的观测器本身也是PDE。因此，使用这样的观测器产生实时估计是计算负担很重的。对于有限维和ODE系统，移动时域估计器（MHE）是一种操作符，其输出是状态估计，而输入是时域起始处的初始状态估计以及移动时间域内的测量输出和输入信号。在本文中，我们引入了用于解决PDE的MHE，以消除实时数值解观测器PDE的需求。我们使用PDE反步法实现了这一点，对于某些特定类别的双曲和抛物型PDE，它能够明确地产生移动时域状态估计。具体来说，为了明确地产生状态估计，我们使用了一个难以解决的观测器PDE的反步变换，将其转化为一个可以明确解决的目标观测器PDE。我们提出的MHE并不是新的观测器设计，而只是明确的MHE实现，它能够在移动时域内产生状态估计。",
