This survey paper provides a systematic and up-to-date review of the research landscape on Poisoning Attacks against Recommendation (PAR). A novel and comprehensive taxonomy is proposed, categorizing existing PAR methodologies into three distinct categories: Component-Specific, Goal-Driven, and Capability Probing. For each category, we discuss its mechanism in detail, along with associated methods. Furthermore, this paper highlights potential future research avenues in this domain.

    "translated_abstract": "现代推荐系统取得了显著的成功，但它们仍然容易受到恶意活动的攻击，特别是毒化攻击。这些攻击涉及将恶意数据注入到推荐系统的训练数据集中，从而损害其完整性，并通过操纵推荐结果来获取非法利润。本调查论文系统地、最新地回顾了针对推荐系统的毒化攻击研究领域。我们提出了一个新颖而全面的分类法，将现有的毒化攻击方法分为三个不同的类别：组件特定、目标驱动和能力探测。对于每个类别，我们详细讨论了其机制以及相关方法。此外，本文还突出了该领域的潜在未来研究方向。另外，为了促进和基准测试毒化攻击的实证比较，我们引入了一个开源库ARLib，该库包含了一整套毒化攻击模型和常用的测试数据集。",
