    "abstract": "We used a dataset of daily Bloomberg Financial Market Summaries from 2010 to 2023, reposted on large financial media, to determine how global news headlines may affect stock market movements using ChatGPT and a two-stage prompt approach. We document a statistically significant positive correlation between the sentiment score and future equity market returns over short to medium term, which reverts to a negative correlation over longer horizons. Validation of this correlation pattern across multiple equity markets indicates its robustness across equity regions and resilience to non-linearity, evidenced by comparison of Pearson and Spearman correlations. Finally, we provide an estimate of the optimal horizon that strikes a balance between reactivity to new information and correlation.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们使用了2010年至2023年的每日Bloomberg金融市场摘要数据集，重新发布在大型金融媒体上，利用ChatGPT和两阶段提示方法确定全球新闻头条如何影响股市走势。我们记录了情绪分数与未来股市回报之间的统计显著正相关关系，这种关系在短期到中期内转变为负相关关系，然后随着时间的推移又变为负相关关系。通过比较Pearson和Spearman相关系数来验证这种相关模式在多个股票市场上的适用性，表明它在不同股票市场中的弹性和非线性中都具有鲁棒性。最后，我们提供了一个最佳时间段的估计，以在新信息的反应性和相关性之间取得平衡。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study uses a dataset of Bloomberg Financial Market Summaries to investigate the correlation between global news headlines and stock market movements. The researchers find a significant correlation between sentiment scores and future equity market returns, which varies over different time horizons and is robust across multiple equity markets. The study provides an estimate of the optimal horizon that balances reactivity to new information and correlation."
