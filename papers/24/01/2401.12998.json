    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在特定领域医学中的效能，尤其是在管理骨关节炎（OA）等复杂疾病方面，仍然大部分未被探索。本研究聚焦于评估和提升LLMs在特定领域的临床能力，以骨关节炎（OA）管理为案例研究。开发了一个特定领域的基准框架，评估LLMs在领域特定知识和真实临床场景中的临床应用之间的表现。开发了一种针对OA管理的专门LLM，名为DocOA，它结合了检索增强生成（RAG）和指令提示。通过客观和人工评估，比较了GPT-3.5、GPT-4和专门助手DocOA的性能。结果显示，通用LLMs如GPT-3.5和GPT-4在OA管理这种专门领域中的表现较差，尤其是在提供个性化治疗建议方面。然而，DocOA显示了显著的表现提升。",
