    "translated_abstract": "环境空气污染仍然是英国的一个关键问题，空气污染浓度数据是改善空气质量的干预措施的基础。然而，英国当前的空气污染监测站网络存在空间稀疏、异质布局和频繁的时间数据缺失问题，通常是由于断电等问题。我们引入了一个可扩展的数据驱动的监督机器学习模型框架，旨在通过填充缺失的测量数据来解决时间和空间数据缺失问题。该方法提供了2018年英格兰1kmx1km的全面数据集，分辨率为每小时一次。我们利用机器学习技术和来自分布不均匀的监测站的实际数据，在研究区域内生成了355,827个合成监测站，产生了价值约700亿英镑的数据。通过验证，评估了模型在预测和估计缺失数据中的性能。",
