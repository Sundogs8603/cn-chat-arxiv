    "translated_abstract": "多细胞自组装的推断是理解形态发生的核心问题，包括胚胎、器官结构、肿瘤等。然而，很难找到能够指示多细胞动力学的结构特征。在这里，我们提出利用基于图的深度神经网络（GNN）的预测能力来发现可以预测动力学的重要图特征。为了证明，我们应用了一个物理学启发的 GNN（piGNN）来预测多细胞集合体的运动能力，从它们在实验和模拟中的位置快照中。我们证明了 piGNN 能够在多细胞生物系统的复杂图特征中导航，这是经典机械模型无法实现的。随着越来越多的多细胞数据的积累，我们提出可以进行合作努力，创建一个多细胞数据库（MDB），从中可以构建一个大型的多细胞图模型。",
