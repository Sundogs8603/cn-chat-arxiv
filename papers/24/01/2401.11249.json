    "abstract": "Trust and privacy have emerged as significant concerns in online transactions. Sharing information on health is especially sensitive but it is necessary for purchasing and utilizing health insurance. Evidence shows that consumers are increasingly comfortable with technology in place of humans, but the expanding use of AI potentially changes this. This research explores whether trust and privacy concern are barriers to the adoption of AI in health insurance. Two scenarios are compared: The first scenario has limited AI that is not in the interface and its presence is not explicitly revealed to the consumer. In the second scenario there is an AI interface and AI evaluation, and this is explicitly revealed to the consumer. The two scenarios were modeled and compared using SEM PLS-MGA. The findings show that trust is significantly lower in the second scenario where AI is visible. Privacy concerns are higher with AI but the difference is not statistically significant within the model.",

    "translated_abstract": "信任和隐私已经成为在线交易中的重要关注点。分享健康信息尤其敏感，但对于购买和使用健康保险来说是必要的。证据表明，消费者越来越愿意使用技术代替人类，但人工智能的广泛使用可能改变这一点。本研究探讨了信任和隐私关注是否成为健康保险中人工智能采用的障碍。比较了两个情景：第一个情景中，有限的人工智能不在界面上，并且其存在没有明确告知消费者。在第二个情景中，有一个人工智能界面和人工智能评估，并且这一点明确告知消费者。使用SEM PLS-MGA模型对这两个情景进行了建模和比较。研究结果显示，信任在第二个情景中明显较低，也就是人工智能可见的情况。隐私关注在人工智能的情况下更高，但在模型内部并没有统计显著性差异。",
