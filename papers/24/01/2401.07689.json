    "translated_abstract": "去中心化交易所是广泛使用的加密资产交易平台。最常见的类型使用自动做市商（AMM），允许交易者在不需要找到匹配的交易对方的情况下交换资产。因此，交易者与由智能合约管理的资产储备进行交换。这些资产由流动性提供者提供，以换取费用。静态分析表明，其中一种资产的小幅价格变动可能会导致流动性提供者遭受损失。尽管AMM取得了成功，但声称流动性提供者经常遭受损失。然而，现有文献对随时间推移的费用动态效应没有充分考虑。因此，我们使用蒙特卡洛模拟研究了动态设置中的临时损失问题。我们的研究结果表明，价格变动不一定导致损失。交易者和套利者支付的费用同样重要。在这方面，我们可以证明对套利友好的环境有益于流动性提供者。",
