    "translated_abstract": "本研究调查了菲律宾消费者对设计师香水的使用模式和目的，并采用目的性抽样和雪球抽样方法作为非概率抽样技术。数据收集使用Google表单进行，大多数受访者从零售商、批发商和实体店购买了设计师香水的整瓶装，偶尔会进行“盲目购买”。每天使用香水是常见的，受访者平均在早上喷洒5.88次，偏爱清新香调和EDP浓度。他们倾向于每天交替使用香水，在菲律宾的气候下选择不同的香调。研究发现，菲律宾受访者主要使用设计师香水来获得宜人和清新的香气。此外，这些香水在提升自尊心、提高情绪和增强个人形象方面起到了作用。一些受访者还报告了一些不常见的应用，例如用香水缓解失眠和偏头痛。",
