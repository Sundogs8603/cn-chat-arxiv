    "abstract": "Conversational search facilitates complex information retrieval by enabling multi-turn interactions between users and the system. Supporting such interactions requires a comprehensive understanding of the conversational inputs to formulate a good search query based on historical information. In particular, the search query should include the relevant information from the previous conversation turns.

    "translated_abstract": "对话搜索通过实现用户和系统之间的多轮交互，实现了复杂信息检索的便利。支持这种交互需要对对话输入有全面的理解，以便根据历史信息制定良好的搜索查询。特别是，搜索查询应包括来自先前对话回合的相关信息。然而，目前的对话式稠密检索方法主要依赖于对经过精调的预训练专门检索器进行整个对话式搜索会话的优化，这可能会变得冗长和嘈杂。此外，现有方法受现有数据集中手动监督信号数量的限制。为了解决上述问题，我们提出了一种历史感知的对话式稠密检索(HAConvDR)系统，它结合了两个思想：上下文去噪的查询重构和根据历史轮次的实际影响进行自动挖掘监督信号。",
