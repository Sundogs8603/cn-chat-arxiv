In this work we focus on one such VRP variant, which contains multiple trucks and multi-leg routing requirements. In these problems, demand is required to move along sequences of nodes, instead of just from a start node to an end node.

    "translated_abstract": "深度强化学习已被证明在解决一些车辆路径问题时非常有效，特别是在使用编码器-解码器注意力机制生成的策略时。然而，对于一些相对简单的问题实例，这些技术已经取得了相当大的成功，但对于一些仍未得到研究和非常复杂的车辆路径问题变体，尚未证明有有效的强化学习方法可用。本文聚焦于一种这样的车辆路径问题变体，其中包含多辆卡车和多分段路径要求。在这些问题中，需求需要沿着节点序列移动，而不仅仅是从起点到终点。为了使深度强化学习成为适用于实际工业规模的供应链物流的有效策略，我们对现有的编码器-解码器注意力模型进行了新扩展，使其能处理多卡车和多分段路径要求。我们的模型具有这样的优势，可以在小规模数据训练下进行，并能在工业供应链物流中进行实际应用。",
