    "translated_abstract": "本文建立了一个案例，为云用户提供任务完成时间的预测，类似于包裹的送达日期或订车的到达时间。我们的分析表明，提供可预测性可能会导致性能和公平性的损失。现有的云调度系统在权衡空间中优化极端点，使其要么极不可预测，要么不实用。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了PCS，一个新的调度框架，旨在提供可预测性的同时平衡其他传统目标。PCS的关键思想是使用加权公平队列调度（WFQ），找到适当的WFQ参数配置（例如类别权重），以满足特定的可预测性目标。它使用模拟辅助的搜索策略，有效地发现处于这些目标之间权衡空间帕累托前沿的WFQ配置。我们在DNN作业调度的GP上实施和评估PCS。",
