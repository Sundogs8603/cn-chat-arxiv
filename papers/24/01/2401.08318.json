    "translated_abstract": "随着通信能力的提升，用于纠正宽带功放器中的非线性的数字预失真（DPD）的深度神经网络（DNN）变得突出。然而，当前缺乏一个独立于测量设置、用于快速DPD探索和客观DPD模型比较的开源平台。本文提出了一个基于PyTorch的开源框架OpenDPD，并附带一个用于功放建模和DPD学习的数据集。我们引入了一种名为Dense Gated Recurrent Unit (DGRU)-DPD的新型端到端学习架构，相较于模拟功放器，在新的数字发射器（DTX）架构下，具有非常规传输特性，表现优于以前的DPD模型。实验结果显示，我们的DGRU-DPD对于200 MHz OFDM信号，实现了-44.69/-44.47 dBc的ACPR和-35.22 dB的EVM。OpenDPD的代码、数据集和文档可在https://github.com/lab-emi/OpenDPD上公开获取。",
