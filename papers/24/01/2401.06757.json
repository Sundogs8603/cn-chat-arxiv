    "translated_abstract": "行人意图预测对于自主驾驶至关重要。特别是，了解行人是否将横穿在自主车辆前方对于执行安全和舒适的操控至关重要。从序列图像中准确且快速地预测此类意图的模型是具有挑战性的。导致这一挑战的一个因素是缺乏具有多样化横穿和非横穿（C/NC）场景的数据集。我们通过引入一个名为ARCANE的框架来解决这个问题，该框架允许自动地生成包含C/NC视频剪辑样本的合成数据集。作为一个示例，我们使用ARCANE生成了一个大型多样化的数据集，命名为PedSynth。我们将展示PedSynth如何补充广泛使用的实际数据集，如JAAD和PIE，从而为C/NC预测提供更准确的模型。考虑到C/NC预测模型的车载部署，我们还提出了一种名为PedGNN的深度模型，它速度快且内存占用非常低。PedGNN基于GNN-G模型。",
