    "abstract": "Random Access is an important step in enabling the initial attachment of a User Equipment (UE) to a Base Station (gNB). The UE identifies itself by embedding a Preamble Index (RAPID) in the phase rotation of a known base sequence, which it transmits on the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH). The signal on the PRACH also enables the estimation of propagation delay, often known as Timing Advance (TA), which is induced by virtue of the UE's position.

    "translated_abstract": "随机接入是使用户设备（UE）与基站（gNB）进行最初连接的重要步骤。UE通过嵌入在已知基序列的相位旋转中的前导索引（RAPID）来进行自我识别，并将其发送到物理随机接入通道（PRACH）。PRACH上的信号还能够估计由UE位置引起的传播时延（常称为时间提前，TA）。传统接收器使用基于相关技术的方法来估计RAPID和TA。本文介绍了一种使用AI/ML模型的替代接收器方法，其中提出了两个神经网络，一个用于RAPID，一个用于TA。与其他研究不同，这两个模型可以并行运行，而不是顺序运行。通过使用模拟数据和实际硬件捕获的实验，我们证明了基于AI/ML的技术相对于传统的相关方法具有更好的性能。",
