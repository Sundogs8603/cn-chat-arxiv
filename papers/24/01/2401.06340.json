    "translated_abstract": "快速串联视觉呈现（RSVP）基于脑机接口（BCI）是一种利用脑电信号进行目标检索的高效技术。传统解码方法的性能改进依赖于大量来自新测试对象的训练数据，这增加了BCI系统的准备时间。一些研究引入了来自现有对象的数据以减少性能改进对新对象数据的依赖性，但它们基于对抗学习的优化策略以及大量数据的训练增加了准备过程中的训练时间。此外，大多数之前的方法只关注脑电信号的单视图信息，而忽略了其他视图的信息，这可能进一步改善性能。为了在减少准备时间的同时提高解码性能，我们提出了一种具有主题专用适配器的时间-频谱融合Transformer（TSformer-SA）。",
