    "translated_abstract": "安全操作中心（SoC）分析师从公开访问的全球威胁数据库中收集威胁报告，并手动自定义以适应特定组织的需求。这些分析师还依赖于内部存储库，作为组织的私有本地知识数据库。可信的网络情报、关键操作细节和相关组织信息都存储在这些本地知识数据库中。分析师利用这些全球和本地知识数据库从事一项繁重的任务，手动创建组织独特的威胁响应和缓解策略。最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）已经展示了高效处理大规模多样化知识源的能力。我们利用这种能力来处理全球和本地知识数据库，自动化生成组织特定的威胁情报。在这项工作中，我们提出了LOCALINTEL，这是一个新颖的自动化知识上下文化系统，可以从全球和本地知识数据库中生成组织的威胁情报。",
