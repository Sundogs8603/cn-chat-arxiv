    "translated_abstract": "提高工业生产过程的能源效率对于竞争力和符合气候政策至关重要。本文介绍了一种数据驱动方法，用于识别感应炉中的最佳熔化模式。通过时间序列KMeans聚类，可以根据温度曲线将熔化模式分类为不同的簇。使用弯曲拐点法，确定了12个簇，代表了熔化模式的范围。针对每个簇建立了熔化时间、能源特定性能和碳成本等性能参数，指示了炉子的效率和环境影响。利用简单加权、乘法指数加权、TOPSIS法、改进的TOPSIS法和VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje等多准则决策方法来确定最佳实践簇。研究成功地识别了最佳实践簇。",
