    "abstract": "Maintaining a high quality of life through physical activities (PA) to prevent health decline is crucial. However, the relationship between individuals health status, PA preferences, and motion factors is complex. PA discussions consistently show a positive correlation with healthy aging experiences, but no explicit relation to specific types of musculoskeletal exercises. Taking advantage of the increasingly widespread existence of smartphones, especially in Indonesia, this research utilizes embedded sensors for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Based on 25 participants data, performing nine types of selected motion, this study has successfully identified important sensor attributes that play important roles in the right and left hands for muscle strength motions as the basis for developing machine learning models with the LSTM algorithm.",
