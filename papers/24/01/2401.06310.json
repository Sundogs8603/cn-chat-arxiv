    "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the issue of stereotypical depictions for people of different identity groups in Text-to-Image (T2I) model generations. However, these existing approaches have several key limitations, including a noticeable lack of coverage of global identity groups in their evaluation, and the range of their associated stereotypes. Additionally, they often lack a critical distinction between inherently visual stereotypes, such as `underweight' or `sombrero', and culturally dependent stereotypes like `attractive' or `terrorist'. In this work, we address these limitations with a multifaceted approach that leverages existing textual resources to ground our evaluation of geo-cultural stereotypes in the generated images from T2I models. We employ existing stereotype benchmarks to identify and evaluate visual stereotypes at a global scale, spanning 135 nationality-based identity groups. We demonstrate that stereotypical attributes are thrice as likely to be present in images",

    "translated_abstract": "近期的研究已经强调了在文本到图像生成（T2I）模型生成的人物形象中存在的不同身份群体的刻板印象问题。然而，这些现有方法存在一些关键限制，包括在评估中对全球身份群体的覆盖率明显不足，以及相关刻板印象的范围。此外，它们通常缺乏对本质上是视觉刻板印象（如“瘦弱”或“墨西哥草帽”）和文化相关的刻板印象（如“吸引人”或“恐怖分子”）之间的重要区别。在本研究中，我们采用多方面的方法来解决这些限制，利用现有的文本资源来将我们对来自T2I模型生成的图像中与地理文化相关的刻板印象的评估进行基础绑定。我们使用现有的刻板印象基准来识别和评估全球范围内涉及135个基于国籍的身份群体的视觉刻板印象。我们证明，在图像中存在刻板印象的可能性是刻板属性的三倍。",
