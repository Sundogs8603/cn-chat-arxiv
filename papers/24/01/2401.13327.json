    "translated_abstract": "智能手表的健康传感器数据在智能健康应用和患者监测中越来越被使用，包括压力检测。然而，这类医疗数据往往包含敏感的个人信息，并且获取这些数据以进行研究是资源密集型的。为了应对这一挑战，我们介绍了一种关注隐私的合成多传感器智能手表健康读数与压力时刻相关的方法。我们的方法包括通过生成对抗网络（GANs）生成合成序列数据，并在模型训练过程中实施差分隐私（DP）防护以保护患者信息。为了确保合成数据的完整性，我们采用一系列质量评估，并监测合成数据与原始数据之间的合理性。为了测试其有用性，我们在一个常用但规模较小的压力检测数据集上创建了私有机器学习模型，并探索了增强现有数据基础的策略。",
