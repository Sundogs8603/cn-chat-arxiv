    "translated_abstract": "传统上，数值算法被视为独立的代码片段，局限于``in silico''存在。然而，这种观点不适用于许多现代计算方法，如控制、学习或优化中，其中``in vivo''算法与其环境进行交互。这些``开放''的例子包括各种实时基于优化的控制策略、强化学习、决策架构、在线优化等等。此外，即使在学习或优化中，``闭合''的算法也越来越多地被抽象为具有相互作用的动态模块和管道的块图。在这篇观点文章中，我们阐述了我们对即将发展的``算法的系统理论''的愿景，并主张将算法视为与其他算法、物理系统、人类或数据库交互的开放动态系统。值得注意的是，在系统理论的伞下开发的多种工具也提供了宝贵的洞见。",
