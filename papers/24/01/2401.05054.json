    "translated_abstract": "文本生成系统中最重要的挑战之一是产生不仅正确而且多样化的输出。最近，最小贝叶斯风险（MBR）解码在生成算法中得到了广泛应用，可以产生最高质量的句子。然而，目前为生成多样化输出而提出的现有算法主要基于波束搜索或随机抽样，因此其输出质量受限于这些基本方法。在本文中，我们探索了一种替代方法--通过将多样性目标强加到MBR解码中来开发促进多样性的解码算法。我们提出了两种MBR的变体，即多样性MBR（DMBR）和k-medoids MBR（KMBR），用于生成一组高质量和多样性的句子。我们使用编码器-解码器模型和大型语言模型进行了各种定向文本生成任务的DMBR和KMBR评估。实验结果表明，所提出的方法实现了更好的传统",
