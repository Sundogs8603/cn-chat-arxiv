    "translated_abstract": "切割平面在解决混合整数线性规划中起着重要作用，它们显著加紧了对偶界限并改善了求解性能。割生成停止问题是割的重要问题，对于提高混合整数线性规划的效率至关重要。然而，许多现代混合整数线性规划求解器使用硬编码启发式策略来解决这个问题，这往往忽视了来自某些应用中的混合整数线性规划的潜在模式。为了解决这个挑战，我们将割生成停止问题形式化为强化学习问题，并提出了一种新颖的混合图表示模型（HYGRO），以学习有效的停止策略。HYGRO的一个吸引人的特点是它可以有效捕捉到混合整数线性规划的动态和静态特征，从而实现对停止策略的动态决策。据我们所知，HYGRO是解决割生成停止问题的第一个数据驱动方法。通过将我们的方法与模型整合起来，我们在 实验证明了我们的方法的有效性。",

By formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning problem and using a hybrid graph representation model for learning, the method can dynamically decide when to stop cut generation and effectively capture the dynamic and static features of mixed-integer linear programming."
