    "translated_abstract": "社区搜索是社区检测的一个衍生问题，可以在线和个性化地发现社区，在大规模实际网络中应用广泛。尽管对于无向图已进行了大量研究，但最近对于有向图中的社区搜索问题需要更多关注。最近提出的D-truss模型在检索到的社区质量上取得了良好的结果。然而，现有的基于D-truss的工作无法在大型图上进行高效的社区搜索，因为检索最大D-truss所需的计算资源太多。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一种创新的合并关系，即D-truss-connected，以捕捉D-truss中边缘的内在密度和凝聚力。该关系将所有原始图中的边缘划分为一系列D-truss-connected类。然后，我们基于D-truss构造了一个简洁且紧凑的索引，称为ConDTruss。",
