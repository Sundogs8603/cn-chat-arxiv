The portfolio performance is periodically evaluated on the relative ratio of two adjacent wealth levels over an infinite horizon. For both power and logarithmic utilities, we formulate the auxiliary one-period optimization problems with modified utility functions, for which we develop the martingale duality approach to establish the existence of the optimal portfolio processes and the dual minimizers can be identified as the \"least favorable\" completion of the market. With the help of the duality results in the auxiliary problems and some fixed point arguments, we further derive and verify the optimal portfolio processes in a periodic manner for the original periodic evaluation problems over an infinite horizon.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在不完全市场模型中，基于一些外部随机因素的基础价格扩散过程的投资组合管理中的一种周期性效用最大化。投资组合表现是在一个无限的时间跨度内通过两个相邻财富水平的比率进行周期性评估。对于功率函数和对数效用函数，我们构建了辅助的一期优化问题，该问题中包含了修改后的效用函数，并利用鞅对偶方法建立了最优投资组合过程的存在性，而对偶最小值可以被识别为市场的“最不利”完成。借助于辅助问题中的对偶结果和一些不动点论证，我们进一步在无限时间跨度内以周期性方式推导和验证了原始周期性评估问题的最优投资组合过程。",
