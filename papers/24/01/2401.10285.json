    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在分析各种STEM活动中的脑活动，探索分类不同任务的可行性。收集了二十个受试者参与五种认知任务时的EEG脑数据，并将其分割为4秒的片段。然后分析了脑频率波的功率谱密度。通过使用XGBoost、Random Forest和Bagging Classifier测试不同的k间隔，发现Random Forest在间隔大小为两个时表现最佳，达到了91.07%的测试准确率。当利用所有四个EEG通道进行分析时，认知灵活性最为明显。任务特定的分类准确度显示右额叶在数学处理和规划方面表现出色，左额叶在认知灵活性和心理灵活性方面表现出色，左颞顶叶在连接方面表现出色。值得注意的是，在STEM活动中观察到了大量额叶和颞顶叶之间的连接。这项研究对于更深入地理解脑活动和学习任务之间的关系具有重要意义。",
