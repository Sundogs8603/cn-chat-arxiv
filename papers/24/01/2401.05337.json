    "abstract": "This study presents an unsupervised machine learning approach for optimizing Profit and Loss (PnL) in quantitative finance. Our algorithm, akin to an unsupervised variant of linear regression, maximizes the Sharpe Ratio of PnL generated from signals constructed linearly from exogenous variables. The methodology employs a linear relationship between exogenous variables and the trading signal, with the objective of maximizing the Sharpe Ratio through parameter optimization. Empirical application on an ETF representing U.S. Treasury bonds demonstrates the model's effectiveness, supported by regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting. The study concludes with potential avenues for further development, including generalized time steps and enhanced corrective terms.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种无监督机器学习方法，用于优化量化金融中的利润和损失（PnL）。我们的算法类似于无监督线性回归，通过线性组合外生变量构建的信号，最大化PnL的夏普比率。该方法利用外生变量与交易信号之间的线性关系，通过参数优化来最大化夏普比率。在代表美国国债的ETF上的实证应用显示了模型的有效性，并通过正则化技术来减轻过度拟合。研究最后提出了进一步发展的潜在途径，包括广义时间步长和增强的纠正项。",
