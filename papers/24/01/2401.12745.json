    "translated_abstract": "机器学习方法在算法选择中通常将描述实例的数据作为输入。输入数据可以是从实例描述或适应度景观中提取的特征，也可以是实例本身的直接表示，即图像或文本描述。无论选择的输入是什么，都存在这样一种隐含假设：相似的实例会引起算法相似的性能，并且模型能够学习到这种关系。我们认为，仅从实例角度来看算法选择可能会误导，因为它未能考虑算法对实例之间相似性的`看法'。我们提出了一种新颖的\"算法中心\"方法来描述实例，可以用于训练算法选择模型：具体而言，我们使用将一个求解器应用于实例一小段时间后计算得到的短探测轨迹。这种方法被证明是有前途的，并提供了一种新的算法选择方法。",
