    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了LLM4SecHW，一种利用领域特定大型语言模型（LLM）进行硬件调试的新框架。虽然LLM在自动化各种软件开发任务方面取得了成功，但在硬件安全领域的应用受到商业LLM的限制和领域特定数据的稀缺性的影响较大。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种独特的方法，利用版本控制数据编制了一个开源硬件设计缺陷及其纠正步骤的数据集。该数据集为训练硬件的机器学习模型提供了坚实的基础。LLM4SecHW基于该数据集进行中型LLM的精细调优，实现了对硬件设计中的错误进行识别和纠正。这种开创性的方法为在其他研究领域中应用精细调优领域特定LLM提供了参考工作流程。我们对我们提出的系统在多种开源硬件上进行了性能评估。",
