Assertion detection in clinical NLP usually involves identifying assertion types for medical concepts in the clinical text, namely certainty (whether the medical concept is positive, negated, possible, or hypothetical), temporality (whether the medical concept is for present or the past history), and experiencer (whether the medical concept is described for the patient or a family member). These assertion types are essential for healthcare professionals to quickly and clearly understand the context of medical conditions from unstructured clinical texts, directly influencing the quality and outcomes of patient care.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在解决临床自然语言处理（NLP）中从临床笔记中提取医学概念时的断言检测任务，这是临床NLP中的关键过程。临床NLP中的断言检测通常涉及在临床文本中为医学概念识别断言类型，即确定性（医学概念是否为积极、否定、可能或假设），时间性（医学概念是指当前还是过去历史）和经验者（医学概念是指患者还是家庭成员）。这些断言类型对于医护人员能够快速明确地从非结构化临床文本中理解医学状况的上下文至关重要，直接影响患者护理质量和结果。尽管被广泛使用，但传统方法，特别是基于规则的NLP系统和机器学习或深度学习模型，需要大量人工努力创建模式，并且往往忽视了",
