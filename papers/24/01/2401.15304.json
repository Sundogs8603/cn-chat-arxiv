    "translated_abstract": "在众多应用中，从有噪声的部分观测中在线预测同时存在于空间和时间中的多变量信号是一项基本任务。我们提出了一种有效的神经网络架构，用于在线估计时变图信号，称为自适应最小均方图神经网络（LMS-GNN）。LMS-GNN旨在捕捉时间变化，并在信号受到噪声和缺失值干扰的条件下建立空间时间交互。LMS-GNN是自适应图滤波器和图神经网络（GNN）的结合。在每个时间步长中，LMS-GNN的前向传播类似于自适应图滤波器，其中输出基于观测和预测之间的误差，类似于GNN。滤波器系数通过反向传播更新，类似于GNN。对真实世界温度数据的实验表明，与基于图的方法相比，我们的LMS-GNN实现了更准确的在线预测。",
