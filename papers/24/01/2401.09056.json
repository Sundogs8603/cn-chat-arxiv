In recent years, there has been a growing interest in AI development and implementation in the region. This paper presents a ranking of Latin American (LATAM) countries based on their potential to become emerging powers in AI. The ranking is based on three pillars: infrastructure, education, and finance. Infrastructure is measured by the availability of electricity, high-speed internet, the quality of telecommunications networks, and the availability of supercomputers. Education is measured by the quality of education and the research status. Finance is measured by the cost of investments, history of investments, economic metrics, and current implementation of AI.  While Brazil, Chile, and Mexico have established themselves as major players in the AI industry in Latin America, our ranking demonstrates the new emerging powers in the region.
