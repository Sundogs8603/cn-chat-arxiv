    "translated_abstract": "深度学习在计算机视觉中取得了显著的进展，尤其在图像分类任务中。尽管深度学习模型在训练数据上具有很高的准确性，但也经常面临与复杂性和过拟合相关的挑战。一个值得关注的问题是，模型通常过于依赖有限的一部分滤波器进行预测。这种依赖性可能导致泛化能力受损，并增加对微小变化的脆弱性。虽然常见的正则化技术如权重衰减、dropout和数据增强可以解决这个问题，但它们可能并没有直接解决对特定滤波器的依赖。我们观察到，当慢学习的滤波器由于快学习的滤波器而失去了学习机会时，这个依赖性问题会变得严重。受图像增强研究的启发，该研究通过删除和替换图像的部分来解决对特定图像区域的过于依赖问题，我们的想法是缓解过于依赖特定滤波器的问题。",
