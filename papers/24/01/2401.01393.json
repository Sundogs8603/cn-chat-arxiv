    "translated_abstract": "最近第三作者引入了一种名为回溯新Q-Newton方法(BNQN)的Newton方法的变种，该方法具有很强的理论保证，易于实现，并具有良好的实验性能。先前进行的实验显示，使用BNQN可以找到多项式和亚纯函数的根时，吸引域具有一些显著的特性。总体上看，它们比Newton方法的吸引域更加平滑。在本文中，我们继续深入实验研究这一显著现象，并将BNQN与Newton流和Voronoi图联系起来。这种联系给出了一些具有挑战性的难题需要解释。实验还表明，与Newton方法和随机松弛Newton方法相比，BNQN对随机扰动更加稳健。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper introduces a new variant of Newton's method called Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (BNQN), which has strong theoretical guarantee, easy implementation, and good experimental performance. The experiments show that BNQN has smoother basins of attraction in finding roots of polynomials and meromorphic functions compared to Newton's method. The paper also explores the connection between BNQN, Newton's flow, and Voronoi's diagram, and discusses BNQN's robustness against random perturbations."
