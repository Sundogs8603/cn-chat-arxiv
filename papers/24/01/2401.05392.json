    "abstract": "Noise is inevitably common in digital images, leading to visual image deterioration. Therefore, a suitable filtering method is required to lessen the noise while preserving the image features (edges, corners, etc.). This paper presents the efficient type-2 fuzzy weighted mean filter with an adaptive threshold to remove the SAP noise. The present filter has two primary steps: The first stage categorizes images as lightly, medium, and heavily corrupted based on an adaptive threshold by comparing the M-ALD of processed pixels with the upper and lower MF of the type-2 fuzzy identifier. The second stage eliminates corrupted pixels by computing the appropriate weight using GMF with the mean and variance of the uncorrupted pixels in the filter window. Simulation results vividly show that the obtained denoised images preserve image features, i.e., edges, corners, and other sharp structures, compared with different filtering methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "噪声在数字图像中普遍存在，导致图像质量下降。因此，需要一种合适的滤波方法来减少噪声同时保留图像特征（边缘、角点等）。本文提出了一种高效的类型-2模糊加权均值滤波器，带有自适应阈值，用于去除盐和胡椒噪声。该滤波器有两个主要步骤：第一阶段根据自适应阈值将图像分类为轻微、中度和重度污染，通过比较处理像素的M-ALD与类型-2模糊识别器的上下MF来实现。第二阶段通过使用滤波窗口内未污染像素的均值和方差来计算适当的权重，来消除受损像素。仿真结果明确表明，所得到的去噪图像保留了图像特征，即边缘、角点和其他清晰结构，与其他不同的滤波方法相比。",
