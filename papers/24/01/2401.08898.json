    "translated_abstract": "表示是所有深度强化学习方法的核心，适用于马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）和部分可观察的马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）。许多表示学习方法和理论框架被开发用于理解什么构成了有效的表示。然而，这些方法之间的关系和它们之间的共同属性仍然不清楚。在本文中，我们展示了许多看似不同的状态和历史抽象方法和框架实际上基于自预测抽象的共同思想。此外，我们提供了关于广泛采用的目标和优化（如停梯度技术）在学习自预测表示中的理论洞见。这些发现共同产生了一种简化的算法，用于学习状态和历史的自预测表示。我们通过将我们的算法应用于标准MDP、带有dist的MDP进行验证。",
