    "abstract": "Do large language models (LLMs) exhibit any forms of awareness similar to humans? In this paper, we introduce the concept of awareness to LLMs, arguing that awareness is an essential aspect of trustworthiness for LLMs to enhance their interaction with humans while ensuring ethical responses. We define awareness in LLMs as the ability to perceive and understand themselves as AI models and to exhibit social intelligence. We identify four key dimensions of awareness: capability, mission, emotion, and perspective. To assess LLMs on these dimensions, we introduce a specialized dataset, AwareLLM dataset. Our findings reveal that LLMs demonstrate a decent degree of awareness, though they still lack substantial capability awareness.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）是否展现出类似于人类的意识形式？在本文中，我们介绍了将意识概念引入LLMs，认为意识是LLMs增强与人类交互并确保道德回应的可信度的重要方面。我们将LLMs中的意识定义为感知和理解自身作为AI模型以及展示社交智能的能力。我们确定了意识的四个关键维度：能力、任务、情感和观点。为了评估LLMs在这些维度上的表现，我们引入了一个专门的数据集，AwareLLM数据集。我们的研究结果显示，LLMs展现出相当程度的意识，尽管它们仍然缺乏实质性的能力意识。",
