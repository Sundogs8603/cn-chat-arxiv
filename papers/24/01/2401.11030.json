    "translated_abstract": "当今的车辆包括智能系统，如连接的自主驾驶和先进驾驶辅助系统（ADAS），以增强驾驶体验，这是通过增加与基础设施的连接性和来自不同感知模式的信息融合实现的。然而，不断增长的连接性与车辆内的传统网络架构相结合，可以被利用来发动对关键车辆系统的主动和被动攻击，直接影响乘客的安全性。机器学习基于入侵检测模型已在最近的文献中成功检测到多个目标攻击向量，其部署通过针对低功耗平台的量化神经网络是可能的。通常需要多个模型同时检测多个攻击向量，增加了面积（资源）成本和能量消耗。在本文中，我们提出使用自定义量化的多层感知机（CQMLP）作为多类分类模型的案例。",
