    "translated_abstract": "预测蛋白质之间的相互作用是结构生物信息学中最重要但也最具挑战性的问题之一。蛋白质表面的潜在功能位点由几何和化学特征共同确定。然而，现有的研究仅考虑手工设计或单独学习的原子类型的化学特征，并独立提取几何特征。 在本文中，我们确定了有效蛋白质表面学习的两个关键属性：1）原子之间的关系：原子通过共价键连接在一起形成生物分子，而不是单独出现，因此在化学特征学习中建模原子之间的关系具有重要意义。2）层次化特征交互：邻近残基效应验证了原子之间以及表面点和原子（或残基）之间的层次化特征交互的重要性。我们提出了一个基于深度学习技术的基于原则的框架，即Hierarchical framework。",
