    "translated_abstract": "混合动力系统在实际的机器人应用中普遍存在，常涉及连续状态和离散状态切换。安全性是混合机器人系统的首要关注点。现有的混合系统的安全关键控制方法要么计算效率低下，对系统性能有损，要么仅适用于小规模系统。为了解决这些问题，在本文中，我们提出了一种学习启用的方法，用于构建本地控制屏障函数（CBFs），以保证广泛类别的非线性混合动力系统的安全性。最终，我们得到了一个安全的基于神经网络的CBF切换控制器。我们的方法在计算上高效，对任何参考控制器的干预最小，并适用于大规模系统。通过两个机器人示例（包括高维自主赛车案例），我们对我们的框架进行了实证评估，并与其他基于CBF的方法和模型预测控制进行了比较，展示了其功效和灵活性。",
