It requires extensive processing to perform the Resolution Enhancement Techniques (RETs) required to transfer the design data to a working Integrated Circuits (ICs). The processing power and computational runtime for RETs tasks is ever increasing due to the continuous reduction of the feature size and the expansion of the chip area. State-of-the-art research sought Machine Learning (ML) technologies to reduce runtime and computational power, however they are still not used in production yet. In this study, we analyze the reasons holding back ML computational lithography from being production ready and present a novel highly scalable end-to-end flow that enables production ready ML-RET correction.",

    "translated_abstract": "光刻技术是半导体制造的主要推动因素，需要进行复杂的处理来执行分辨率增强技术（RET）以将设计数据转移到工作集成电路（ICs）。由于特征尺寸的持续减小和芯片面积的扩大，RET任务的处理能力和计算运行时间不断增加。现有研究借助机器学习（ML）技术来减少运行时间和计算功率，但它们目前还未在实际生产中使用。本研究分析了阻碍ML计算光刻实现生产就绪的原因，并提出了一种新颖的高度可扩展的端到端流程，实现了生产就绪的ML-RET修正。",
