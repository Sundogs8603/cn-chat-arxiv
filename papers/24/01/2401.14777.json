    "translated_abstract": "最近，自然语言处理（NLP）在金融机构中变得越来越重要，因为它可以提供有关公司和市场的金融文件的高度有价值的见解。然而，金融领域的景观对NLP提出了额外的挑战，因为文本的复杂性和特定术语的使用。即使使用具有出色的自然语言理解和生成能力的大规模语言模型（LLM），通用语言模型在专门针对金融的任务上也往往表现不佳。本文提出了一项关于以金融领域为目标的LLM适应方法研究，并高度关注金融情感分析。为此，我们使用了各种广泛的策略来适应两个参数低于15亿的基础模型。我们展示了通过在金融文档和说明书上进行精细调优，这些基础模型可以适应目标领域。此外，我们观察到小型LLM具有相似的适应能力。",
