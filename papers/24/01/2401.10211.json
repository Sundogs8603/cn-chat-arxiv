    "translated_abstract": "蛋白质翻译后修饰（PTM）位点预测是生物信息学中的重要任务。已经开发了几种计算方法来预测PTM位点。然而，现有方法忽略了结构信息，仅利用蛋白质序列。此外，PTM是发生在原子粒度的生物事件，所以迫切需要设计一种更精细的结构表示学习方法。在本文中，我们提出了一种通过多粒度结构和多尺度序列表示耦合的PTM位点预测方法，简称PTM-CMGMS。具体而言，我们设计了多粒度结构感知表示学习方法，从AlphaFold预测的结构中学习氨基酸、原子和整个蛋白质的邻域结构表示，然后利用对比学习优化结构表示。此外，我们还使用了多尺度序列表示学习来提取上下文序列信息。",
