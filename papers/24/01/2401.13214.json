    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于深度学习的方法已成功应用于合成孔径雷达(SAR)图像的船舶检测。尽管已经开发了许多船舶检测方法，但由于海岸环境中特征有限和杂乱干扰的原因，检测小型和沿海船舶仍然是一个重要挑战。为此，提出了一种新颖的自适应多层次注意力模块(AMAM)，用于学习多尺度特征，并在复杂环境中自适应地聚合显著特征。具体而言，我们首先融合相邻特征层的信息，增强对较小目标的检测，从而实现多尺度特征增强。然后，为了滤除复杂背景的负面效果，我们在通道上解剖之前融合的多级特征，单独挖掘显著区域，并自适应地汇集来自不同通道的特征。第三，我们提出了一种新颖的自适应多层次注意力网络(AMANet)，用于综合建模和船舶检测。",
