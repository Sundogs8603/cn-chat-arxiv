We consider a dense deployment of subnetworks in the factory environment with a limited number of sub-bands which must be optimally allocated to coordinate inter-subnetwork interference. We model the subnetwork deployment as a conflict graph and propose an unsupervised learning approach inspired by the graph colouring heuristic and the Potts model to optimize the sub-band allocation using graph neural networks. The numerical evaluation shows that the proposed method achieves close performance to the centralized greedy colouring sub-band allocation heuristic with lower computational time complexity. In addition, it incurs reduced signalling overhead compared to iterative optimization heuristics that require all the mutual interfering channel information.

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们提出了一种无监督的基于图的学习方法，用于在无线网络中进行频率子带分配。我们考虑在工厂环境中密集部署的子网络，这些子网络只有有限数量的子频带，必须被优化地分配以协调子网络间的干扰。我们将子网络部署建模为一个冲突图，并提出了一种受到图着色启发和Potts模型的无监督学习方法，利用图神经网络来优化子频带分配。数值评估表明，所提出的方法在较低的计算时间复杂度下，实现了与集中式贪婪着色子频带分配启发式方法接近的性能。此外，与需要所有互相干扰的信道信息的迭代优化启发式相比，它产生更少的信令开销。我们进一步证明该方法对不同的网络设置具有健壮性。",
