Our analysis demonstrates the practical benefits for scalable (prudential) risk management stem",

    "translated_abstract": "稳定币已经成为不断增长的数字资产领域的“致命”应用案例。然而，风险管理框架，包括监管框架，大多数情况下都缺失。在本论文中，我们解决了在基于公共区块链基础设施运营的稳定币协议中衡量和管理风险的关键问题。链上环境使得实时通过透明智能合约监控风险并自动化管理成为可能。我们提出了涵盖稳定币协议资本化和流动性的两个风险指标。然后，我们通过一个案例研究类型的分析探讨了我们的风险管理框架如何应用于当前市值最大的去中心化稳定币DAI，该稳定币由MakerDAO治理。根据我们的研究结果，我们建议该协议探索实施自动资本缓冲调整和动态到期时间匹配。我们的分析证明了可扩展(审慎)风险管理的实际益处。",
