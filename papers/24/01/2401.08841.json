    "abstract": "The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is probably the most disruptive global health disaster in recent history. It negatively impacted the whole world and virtually brought the global economy to a standstill. However, as the virus was spreading, infecting people and claiming thousands of lives so was the spread and propagation of fake news, misinformation and disinformation about the event. These included the spread of unconfirmed health advice and remedies on social media. In this paper, false information about the pandemic is identified using a content-based approach and metadata curated from messages posted to online social networks. A content-based approach combined with metadata as well as an initial feature analysis is used and then several supervised learning models are tested for identifying and predicting misleading posts. Our approach shows up to 93% accuracy in the detection of fake news related posts about the COVID-19 pandemic",

    "translated_abstract": "新冠疫情（COVID-19）可能是近代历史上最具破坏性的全球卫生灾难。它对整个世界造成了负面影响，几乎将全球经济陷入停滞。然而，随着病毒的传播，感染人数的增加以及对事件的虚假消息、错误信息和假信息的传播也随之增加。这些包括在社交媒体上传播未经证实的健康建议和疗法。本文使用基于内容的方法以及从在线社交网络发布的消息中提炼的元数据来识别有关大流行病的虚假信息。使用基于内容的方法结合元数据以及初始特征分析，并测试了几种监督学习模型来识别和预测误导性的帖子。我们的方法在检测与COVID-19大流行相关的虚假新闻的帖子方面显示出93%的准确率。",
