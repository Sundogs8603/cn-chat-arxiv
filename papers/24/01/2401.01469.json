In recent years summarization of EHRs have employed machine learning pipelines using state of the art neural models.

Moreover, the requirement to consider the entire content of an EHR in summarization has resulted in poor performance due to the fact that attention mechanisms in modern large language models (LLMs) adds a quadratic complexity in terms of the size of the input.

    "translated_abstract": "电子健康记录（EHRs）的摘要可以大大减少患者和医务人员的“屏幕时间”。近年来，EHRs的摘要已经使用最先进的神经模型进行机器学习流程。然而，由于难以获得足够的注释数据进行训练，这些模型产生的结果不够满意。此外，由于现代大型语言模型（LLMs）中的注意机制在输入大小方面增加了二次复杂性，因此需要考虑整个EHR内容的摘要效果较差。我们提出了一种通过结合语义搜索、检索增强生成（RAG）和最新的LLMs来缓解这些缺点的方法。在我们的方法中，摘要是提取被专业人士认为重要的特定问题的答案。",
