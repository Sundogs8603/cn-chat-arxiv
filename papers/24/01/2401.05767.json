    "translated_abstract": "个人数据包括我们在日常活动中留下的数字足迹，无论是在线还是离线的真实世界中。它包括我们自己收集的数据，例如来自可穿戴设备的数据，以及他人收集的有关我们在线行为和活动的数据。有时候我们能够使用我们自己收集的个人数据，以便检查我们生活的某些方面，但在大多数情况下，我们的个人数据被第三方，包括互联网公司，用于定向广告和推荐等服务。Lifelogging是一种极端个人数据收集的形式，在本文中，我们介绍了在最近一次Lifelog搜索挑战基准测试研讨会上展示的用于管理对Lifelogs的访问的工具的概述。在这里，实验系统通过真实用户展示了实时信息搜索任务。这些系统能力的概述展示了访问Lifelog的各种可能性。",
    "tldr": "本文介绍了Lifelogging作为极致个人信息管理的形式，探讨了个人数据的搜集和访问方式，并呼吁对第三方使用个人数据的审慎性。",
