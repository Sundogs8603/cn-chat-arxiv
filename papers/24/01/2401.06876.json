    "translated_abstract": "航空公司的飞机队现代化可以降低运营成本，提高乘客感知到的服务质量，并减少排放。本文研究了航空公司采用从制造商那里获得新一代飞机的技术创新的市场激励因素。我们在巴西商业航空业发展了一个包括二十年数据的经济计量模型来研究飞机队现代化。我们检验了市场集中度和飞机队现代化之间呈倒U型关系的假设，并发现竞争和集中度的两个极端都可能抑制航空公司对创新的采纳。我们发现有限的证据表明枢纽活动或低成本航空公司与行业内引入新型飞机模型和变体的强度相关。最后，我们的结果表明，能源成本的上升可能在长期内催生飞机队现代化，航空公司可能会更多地关注生态效益。",

Additionally, there is no clear correlation between hubbing activity or low-cost carriers and the introduction of new aircraft models and variants. Lastly, the study suggests that rising energy costs may accelerate fleet modernization in the long term, with a focus on eco-efficiency."
