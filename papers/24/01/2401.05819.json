    "translated_abstract": "听觉空间注意力检测（ASAD）通过分析电脑脑电信号来确定听众对说话者的注意方向。本研究旨在改进ASAD的性能，使用较短的决策窗口（小于1秒），而不是以前研究中使用的较长决策窗口。本文介绍了一种端到端的时间注意力网络（即TAnet）。TAnet采用多头注意力机制，可以更有效地捕捉采集到的脑电信号中时间步之间的相互作用，并为这些时间步分配相应的权重。实验表明，与基于CNN的方法和最近的ASAD方法相比，TAnet在KUL数据集中提供了改进的解码性能，使用较短的决策窗口（即小于1秒）的情况下，解码准确率分别为92.4%（决策窗口0.1秒）、94.9%（0.25秒）、95.1%（0.3秒）、95.4%（0.4秒）和95.5%（0.5秒）。",
