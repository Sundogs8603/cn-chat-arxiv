    "translated_abstract": "组织病理学图像中的核实例分割对于生物分析和癌症诊断至关重要，但由于两个原因而具有挑战性。首先，嗜染核内和核外区域的视觉呈现相似，常常导致欠分割。其次，当前方法缺乏对核结构的探索，导致分段实例的碎片化预测。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种称为SEINE的结构编码和交互网络，该网络开发了核的结构建模方案，并利用核之间的结构相似性来提高每个分割实例的完整性。具体而言，SEINE引入了基于轮廓的结构编码（SE），以考虑核结构和语义之间的相关性，实现对核结构的合理表示。基于编码，我们提出了结构引导的注意力（SGA），它以清晰的核作为原型，以增强注意力以实现更好的分割结果。",
