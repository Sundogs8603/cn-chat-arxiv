    "translated_abstract": "先驱性的研究已经验证了扩散模型在探索推荐中信息不确定性方面的有效性。考虑到推荐和图像合成任务之间的差异，现有方法已经针对扩散和反向过程进行了定制优化。然而，这些方法通常使用语料库中最高分的项目来预测用户的兴趣，导致忽视了其他项目中包含的用户广义偏好，从而仍然受限于数据稀疏问题。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种新颖的插件扩散模型用于推荐（PDRec）框架，该框架将扩散模型作为灵活的插件，共同充分利用扩散生成的用户对所有项目的偏好。具体而言，PDRec首先通过时间间隔扩散模型推断用户对所有项目的动态偏好，并提出了一种历史行为重新加权（HBR）机制来识别用户的广义偏好。",
