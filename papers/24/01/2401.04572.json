    "translated_abstract": "游戏开发是一个漫长的过程，在产品上市之前需要经过许多阶段。人工游戏测试是其中最耗时的，因为测试人员需要反复执行任务以寻找代码中的错误。因此，自动化测试被视为游戏行业的关键技术，它将显著提高开发成本和效率。为此，我们提出了EVOLUTE，一种新颖的基于模仿学习的架构，它将行为克隆（BC）与能量模型（EBM）相结合。EVOLUTE是一个两流模型，将自主代理的动作空间分为连续和离散任务。EBM流处理连续任务，以获得更精细和自适应的控制，而BC流处理离散动作，以方便训练。我们在一个射击和驾驶游戏中评估了EVOLUTE的性能，其中代理需要导航并持续识别目标进行攻击。",

By combining behavioral cloning and energy based models, it effectively optimizes control and training in the continuous and discrete tasks of autonomous agents. Experimental results demonstrate its good performance in a shooting-and-driving game."
