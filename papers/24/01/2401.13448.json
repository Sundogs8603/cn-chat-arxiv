    "translated_abstract": "在基于位置的社交网络中，兴趣点（POI）推荐帮助用户发现有趣的地方。为了保护隐私和减少服务器依赖，从基于云的模型转向设备上的推荐是一个趋势。由于个别设备上的本地用户-项目交互数据稀缺，仅依赖本地数据是不足够的。协作学习（CL）兴起，促进用户之间的模型共享，其中引用数据作为中介，使用户能够在不直接共享私有数据或参数的情况下交换他们的软决策，确保隐私并从协作中受益。然而，现有的基于协作学习的推荐通常为所有用户使用同一个引用数据。对一个用户有价值的引用数据可能对另一个用户有害，鉴于用户偏好的多样性。用户可能不会对他们兴趣范围之外的项目提供有意义的软决策。因此，为所有协作使用相同的引用数据可能会阻碍协作推荐的效果。",
