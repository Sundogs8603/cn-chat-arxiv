    "translated_abstract": "气候变化是我们星球面临的最重要的挑战之一。全球气温的上升已经带来了对地球气候和天气模式的显著变化，不可预测和极端天气事件的频率增加。气候变化研究的未来预测基于地球系统模型（ESMs），这些计算机模型模拟地球的气候系统。 ESMs 提供了整合各种物理系统的框架，但它们的输出受到运行和存档更高分辨率模拟所需的巨大计算资源的限制。对于给定的资源预算，ESMs 通常在较粗的网格上运行，然后进行计算量较小的“下调尺度”过程以获得更高分辨率的输出。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种用于下调尺度 ESM 模拟数据的深度学习模型，该模型不需要高分辨率的真实数据进行模型优化。这是通过利用显著的数据分布来实现的。",
