    "translated_title": "何时进行神经增长？一种适应风险感知的神经网络层增长策略",
    "translated_abstract": "神经增长是将小型神经网络扩展为大型网络的过程，已被用于加速深度神经网络的训练。神经增长的一个关键方面是确定最佳增长时机。然而，很少有研究系统地调查这一问题。我们的研究发现，神经增长本质上具有一种正则化效果，其强度受增长时机策略的影响。尽管这种正则化效果可以缓解模型的过拟合风险，但在模型欠拟合时可能导致显著的准确度下降。然而，由于当前方法未考虑神经增长的正则化效果，因此未解决这一问题。受这些发现的启发，我们提出了一种风险感知的增长时机策略，根据潜在的欠拟合/过拟合风险水平自动调整增长时机，以应对两种风险。通过使用CIFAR-10/10进行全面的实验验证了这种策略的有效性。",
