While the properties that ensure the global stability of these chains are well studied, their establishment often relies on the fulfillment of a certain splitting condition. We address the challenges of verifying the splitting condition, by introducing simple, applicable conditions that ensure global stability. The simplicity of these conditions is demonstrated through various examples including autoregressive processes and portfolio allocation problems.",
