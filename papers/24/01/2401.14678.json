    "translated_abstract": "随着数据稀疏问题的缓解，跨领域推荐作为有效的技术已经在近年来得到广泛研究。然而，之前的研究工作可能会导致领域隐私泄露，因为它们在训练过程中需要将各个领域的数据聚合到一个中央服务器上。虽然一些研究通过联邦学习对隐私进行保护的跨领域推荐进行了研究，但仍存在以下限制：1）它们需要将用户的个人信息上传到中央服务器，存在用户隐私泄露的风险。2）现有的联邦方法主要依赖于原子项目ID来表示项目，这使它们无法在统一的特征空间中对项目进行建模，增加了领域之间的知识转移的挑战。3）它们都基于知道领域之间重叠用户的前提，这在实际应用中是不可行的。为了解决上述限制，我们着眼于隐私保护跨领域推荐。",
