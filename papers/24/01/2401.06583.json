Four multilingual pre-trained transformer models (mBERT, mT5 XLM RoBERTa, ErnieM) were evaluated using three mapping methods across 20 language pairs representing combinations of five selected languages of the European Union.

    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统对于文档已经成为在网络上找到相关内容的工具。然而，当推荐非查询语言的文档时，这些系统存在一定限制，可能会忽视非母语的资源。本研究旨在通过使用映射到跨语言领域的变形器技术文档表示（TLDRs）来表示跨语言文档。评估了四个多语言预训练变形器模型（mBERT，mT5 XLM RoBERTa，ErnieM）在20种语言对上使用三种映射方法的效果，这些语言对代表了欧盟选择的五种语言的组合。使用Mate检索率和互惠排序等指标来衡量映射TLDRs与未映射TLDRs的效果。结果强调了通过预训练变形器和映射方法实现的跨语言表示的能力，为扩展跨语言文档表示提供了有希望的方向。",
