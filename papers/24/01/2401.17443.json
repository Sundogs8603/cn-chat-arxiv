    "title": "Liquid Democracy for Low-Cost Ensemble Pruning",
    "abstract": "We argue that there is a strong connection between ensemble learning and a delegative voting paradigm -- liquid democracy -- that can be leveraged to reduce ensemble training costs. We present an incremental training procedure that identifies and removes redundant classifiers from an ensemble via delegation mechanisms inspired by liquid democracy. Through both analysis and extensive experiments we show that this process greatly reduces the computational cost of training compared to training a full ensemble. By carefully selecting the underlying delegation mechanism, weight centralization in the classifier population is avoided, leading to higher accuracy than some boosting methods. Furthermore, this work serves as an exemplar of how frameworks from computational social choice literature can be applied to problems in nontraditional domains.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们认为，集合学习和一种代理投票模式——液态民主之间存在着强烈的联系，可以通过液态民主来降低集合训练的成本。我们提出了一种增量训练的过程，通过液态民主的启发，通过委派机制来识别和移除集合中的冗余分类器。通过分析和大量实验，我们展示了这个过程大大降低了训练的计算成本，相比于训练一个完整的集合。通过精选底层的委派机制，避免了分类器群体的权重集中，提高了准确性，而且，这项工作也展示了计算社会选择文献中的框架如何应用于非传统领域的问题。",

By utilizing delegation mechanisms inspired by liquid democracy, redundant classifiers are identified and removed, significantly reducing the computational cost of ensemble training while maintaining higher accuracy compared to some boosting methods.
