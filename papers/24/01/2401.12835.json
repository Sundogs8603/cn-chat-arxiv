    "translated_abstract": "场景图生成（SGG）因其组合性质而仍然是一个具有挑战性的视觉理解任务。大多数以前的方法采用自下而上的两阶段或基于点的一阶段方法，这些方法往往受到高时间复杂度或次优设计的困扰。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的SGG方法来解决上述问题，将该任务形式化为一个二分图构建问题。为了解决上述问题，我们创建了一个基于Transformer的端到端框架来生成实体和实体感知谓词候选集，并推断出形成关系三元组的有向边。此外，我们设计了一个图组装模块来根据我们的实体感知结构推断出二分图的连通性，使我们能够以端到端的方式生成场景图。基于二分图组装范例，我们进一步提出了一种新的技术设计来解决实体感知建模的有效性和图组装的优化稳定性问题。",
