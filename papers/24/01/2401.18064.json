    "translated_abstract": "本地敏感哈希（LSH）是一种广泛应用于大规模数据处理应用中的基本算法技术，例如最近邻搜索、实体解析和聚类。然而，在一些真实场景中，由于需要精心设计与特定度量相匹配的哈希函数，LSH的适用性受到限制。现有基于LSH的实体阻塞解决方案主要依赖于通用相似度度量，例如Jaccard相似度，而实际应用案例通常需要复杂和定制的相似度规则，超过了通用相似度度量的能力。因此，为这些定制的相似度规则设计LSH函数带来了相当大的挑战。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种神经网络化方法，通过训练深度神经网络作为复杂度量的哈希函数，以增强本地敏感哈希的效果。我们在实体解析问题的背景下评估了这种方法的有效性。",
