Unlike traditional models, machine unlearning dynamically adjusts system knowledge based on shifts in user preferences and ethical considerations. Through critical examination and literature review, it provides insights into how machine unlearning can transform recommendations, build user trust, and guide future research in responsible and user-focused artificial intelligence. It emphasizes the trade-off between personalization and privacy, encourages contributions that meet practical demands, and pushes the boundaries of secure and adaptive machine learning. The novelty lies in exploring the limitations of these methods."
