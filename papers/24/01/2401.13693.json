    "abstract": "Challenges can be seen as a type of game that motivates participants to solve serious tasks. As a result, competition organizers must develop effective game rules. However, these rules have multiple objectives beyond making the game enjoyable for participants. These objectives may include solving real-world problems, advancing scientific or technical areas, making scientific discoveries, and educating the public. In many ways, creating a challenge is similar to launching a product. It requires the same level of excitement and rigorous testing, and the goal is to attract ''customers'' in the form of participants. The process begins with a solid plan, such as a competition proposal that will eventually be submitted to an international conference and subjected to peer review. Although peer review does not guarantee quality, it does force organizers to consider the impact of their challenge, identify potential oversights, and generally improve its quality. This chapter provides guidelines ",

    "translated_abstract": "挑战可以被看作是一种激励参与者解决严肃任务的游戏。因此，竞赛组织者必须制定有效的游戏规则。然而，这些规则除了使游戏对参与者来说趣味十足之外还有多个目标。这些目标可能包括解决现实世界的问题、推进科学或技术领域、进行科学发现和教育公众。在许多方面，创建一项挑战类似于推出一款产品。它需要相同的兴奋和严格的测试，其目标是以参与者的形式吸引“客户”。这个过程从一个坚实的计划开始，比如一个竞赛提案，最终将提交给国际会议并接受同行评审。虽然同行评审不能保证质量，但它确实迫使组织者考虑他们的挑战的影响，识别潜在的疏漏，并通常提高其质量。本章提供了指导原则。",
