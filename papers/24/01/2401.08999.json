    "translated_abstract": "稳态是生物维持内部平衡的生理过程。先前的研究表明，稳态是一种学习行为。最近引入的稳态调节的强化学习（HRRL）框架试图通过将驱动减少理论和强化学习相结合来解释这种学习的稳态行为。这种链接已经在离散时间空间上得到证明，但是在连续时间空间上尚未得到证明。在这项工作中，我们将HRRL框架推广到连续时间空间环境，并验证连续时间连续空间HRRL（CTCS-HRRL）框架。我们通过设计一个模型来模拟真实生物代理中的稳态机制来实现这一目标。该模型使用Hamilton-Jacobian Bellman方程以及基于神经网络和强化学习的函数近似。通过基于模拟的实验，我们展示了该模型的有效性，并揭示了与代理能力有关的证据。",
