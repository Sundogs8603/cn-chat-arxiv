    "translated_abstract": "准确近似动力系统的轨迹能够实现对其分析、预测和控制。基于神经网络的近似具有快速评估和长时间步长的准确性，因此受到了广泛关注。与传统的龙格-库塔方法等数值近似方案相比，基于神经网络的近似误差估计相对困难。在这项工作中，我们提出使用神经网络的预测结果在高阶隐式龙格-库塔 (IRK)方法中。隐式方程组中的残差可以与神经网络的预测误差相关联，因此我们可以在轨迹的多个点上提供误差估计。我们发现，这个误差估计与神经网络的预测误差高度相关，并且增加IRK方法的阶数可以改善这个估计。我们以物理知识神经网络 (PINNs)在逻辑方程上进行了这个估计方法的演示。",
