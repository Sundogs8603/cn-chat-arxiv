    "translated_abstract": "尽管自动驾驶车辆（AVs）取得了重大进展，但确保AVs的安全性和交通流效率的驾驶策略的发展尚未得到充分探索。在本文中，我们提出了一种增强的人机协作强化学习方法，称为基于人作为AI导师的深度强化学习（HAIM-DRL）框架，以在混合交通编队中实现安全高效的自动驾驶。从人类学习过程中汲取灵感，我们首先引入了一种创新的学习范式，有效地将人类智能注入到AI中，称为人作为AI导师（HAIM）。在这个范式中，人类专家作为导师为AI代理提供帮助。在允许代理在不确定环境中进行充分探索的同时，人类专家可以在危险情况下接管控制，并展示正确的行动以避免潜在事故。另一方面，可以指导代理减小交通流干扰，从而优化交通流效果。",
