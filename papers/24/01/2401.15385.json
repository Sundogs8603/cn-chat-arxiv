    "translated_abstract": "虽然基于文本的事件提取已成为一个活跃的研究领域，在许多领域已经取得了成功的应用，但直接从语音中提取语义事件是一个尚未探索的问题。本文介绍了语音事件提取（SpeechEE）任务，并构建了三个合成训练集和一个由人类朗读的测试集。与从文本中提取事件相比，SpeechEE主要由于连续且没有词边界的复杂语音信号而面临更大的挑战。此外，与可感知的声音事件不同，语义事件更加微妙，需要更深入的理解。为了解决这些挑战，我们引入了一种序列到结构生成的范式，可以以端到端的方式从语音信号中产生事件，并且提出了一种依赖语音识别转录作为语境线索的条件生成方法。我们进一步提议以扁平的格式表示事件，使输出更像自然语言。实验结果表明，我们的方法在语音事件提取任务上取得了很好的效果。",
