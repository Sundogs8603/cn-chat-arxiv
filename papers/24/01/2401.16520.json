    "translated_abstract": "在地球科学领域中，有效的云属性检索包括云遮蔽、云相分类和云光学厚度（COT）预测仍然至关重要。传统方法需要针对每个传感器仪器使用不同的模型，因为它们具有独特的光谱特征。最近，在地球科学研究中采用了机器学习和深度学习技术从卫星数据集的光谱观测中提取特征。然而，现有方法缺乏考虑检索任务之间层级关系的创新架构。此外，考虑到现有传感器之间的光谱多样性，开发具有对不同传感器数据集具有健壮泛化能力的模型是必要的。令人惊讶的是，目前缺乏解决多样数据集下选择最优模型的方法。为此，本文引入了MT-HCCAR，这是一种端到端的深度学习模型，采用多任务学习和基于注意力的回归方法。",
