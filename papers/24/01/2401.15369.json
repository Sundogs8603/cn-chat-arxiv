    "translated_abstract": "跨领域顺序推荐是推荐系统的重要发展方向。它结合了顺序推荐系统和跨领域推荐系统的特点，可以捕捉用户的动态偏好并缓解冷启动用户的问题。然而，近年来，人们越来越关注自己的隐私。他们不希望别人知道他们刚刚购买了什么、观看了哪些视频以及他们来自哪里。如何保护用户的隐私已经成为一个迫切需要解决的问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的隐私保护的跨领域顺序推荐系统（PriCDSR），它可以同时为用户提供推荐服务并保护他们的隐私。具体而言，我们在数据上定义了一种新的差分隐私，考虑了ID信息和顺序信息。然后，我们设计了一个满足这种差分隐私的随机机制...",
