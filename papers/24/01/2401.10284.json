    "translated_abstract": "睡眠阶段分类（SSC）是一项耗时的任务，需要专家检查数小时的电生理记录进行手动分类。这在利用睡眠阶段进行治疗目的时是一个限制因素。随着可穿戴设备的价格越来越可承受和扩张，自动化SSC可能使得规模扩大的睡眠基础治疗成为可能。深度学习作为一种潜在的自动化方法已经引起了越来越多的关注，先前的研究已经显示出与手动专家评分相当的准确性。然而，以前的方法需要大量的内存和计算资源，这限制了实时分类和在边缘部署模型的能力。为了填补这个空白，我们的目标是提供一个能够在实时预测睡眠阶段的模型，而不需要访问外部计算资源（例如移动手机、云）。该算法具有低功耗的特点，能够在嵌入式电池供电系统上使用。",
