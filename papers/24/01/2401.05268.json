    "translated_abstract": "语言代理在各种复杂任务上取得了相当的性能。尽管在这个领域进行了不断的探索，但现有的语言代理系统仍然面临昂贵、不可重复的数据依赖问题，并且面临将单一模型应用于多个功能的挑战。为此，我们介绍了AutoAct，这是一个自动代理学习框架，不依赖于大规模带注释的数据和来自闭源模型（如GPT-4）的合成轨迹。给定有限的数据和工具库，AutoAct首先自动合成规划轨迹，不需要人类或强闭源模型的任何辅助。然后，AutoAct利用分工策略，根据目标任务信息和合成轨迹自动区分，产生一个子代理组来完成任务。我们进行了多种LLMs的广泛实验，结果显示AutoAct在性能上优于或与其相当。",
