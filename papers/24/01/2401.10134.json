    "translated_abstract": "交通预测是智能交通系统的关键组成部分，它通过使用历史数据来预测特定位置的未来交通情况。尽管现有的交通预测模型通常强调开发复杂的神经网络结构，但它们的准确性并未相应提高。最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）在时间序列分析方面显示出了出色的能力。与现有模型不同，LLMs主要通过参数扩展和广泛的预训练来进步，同时保持其基本结构。本文提出了一种空间-时间大语言模型（ST-LLM）用于交通预测。具体而言，ST-LLM将每个位置的时间步长定义为标记，并结合空间-时间嵌入模块来学习标记的空间位置和全局时间表示。然后，这些表示被融合以为每个标记提供统一的空间和时间信息。",
