    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一个关于库图与信息科学领域的先驱人物S.R. Ranganathan教授的新颖生平知识图谱（KG）。发现关于Ranganathan的相关事实存在于各种资源中，以碎片化和零散的方式提供信息。通过这个专门的KG，我们希望为他的生平和成就提供一个360度的视角。据我们所知，这种专门的表示在其范围和覆盖范围上是无可比拟的：使用最先进的技术供任何人公开访问、使用/再使用和贡献。受Ranganathan的理论和思想的启发，KG使用“基于特征的方法论”在两个层面上进行了发展：在关键的生平方面的标识和本体模型的开发。最后，通过这项研究，我们呼吁整个社区共同努力。",
