    "abstract": "Many online platforms of today, including social media sites, are two-sided markets bridging content creators and users. Most of the existing literature on platform recommendation algorithms largely focuses on user preferences and decisions, and does not simultaneously address creator incentives. We propose a model of content recommendation that explicitly focuses on the dynamics of user-content matching, with the novel property that both users and creators may leave the platform permanently if they do not experience sufficient engagement. In our model, each player decides to participate at each time step based on utilities derived from the current match: users based on alignment of the recommended content with their preferences, and creators based on their audience size. We show that a user-centric greedy algorithm that does not consider creator departures can result in arbitrarily poor total engagement, relative to an algorithm that maximizes total engagement while accounting for two",

    "translated_abstract": "现今许多在线平台，包括社交媒体网站，都是桥接内容创作者与用户的双边市场。现有的关于平台推荐算法的文献主要集中在用户偏好和决策上，并没有同时考虑到创作者的动机。我们提出了一个内容推荐模型，明确关注用户-内容匹配的动态过程，其新颖之处在于如果用户和创作者没有足够的参与感，他们都可能永久离开平台。在我们的模型中，每个参与者根据当前匹配的实用性决定是否在每个时间步参与：用户基于推荐内容与其偏好的一致性，而创作者则基于其受众规模。我们证明了一种以用户为中心的贪心算法，如果不考虑创作者的离开，可能导致整体参与度任意下降，相对于考虑到双方利益最大化整体参与度的算法。",
