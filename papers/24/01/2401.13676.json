    "abstract": "Hong Kong's anti-ELAB movement had a significant impact on the stock market the stock price of listed companies. Using the number of protestors as the measurement of daily protesting intensity from 2019/6/6 to 2020/1/17, this paper documents that the stock price of listed companies associated with the pan-democratic parties were more negatively affected by protesting than other companies. Furthermore, this paper finds that after the implementation of the anti-mask law, protesting had a positive impact on red chips but a negative impact on companies related to pan-democracy parties. Therefore, this paper believes that after the central government and the HKSAR government adopted strict measures to stop violence and chaos, the value of the political connection of red chips became positive while the value of the connection with pan-democracy parties became negative.",

    "translated_abstract": "香港的反修例运动对上市公司的股票市场和股价产生了重大影响。本文利用抗议者数量作为每日抗议强度的测量指标，从2019年6月6日至2020年1月17日期间的数据显示，与泛民主党派有关的上市公司的股价受抗议活动的影响更为负面。此外，本文发现在实施禁止佩戴口罩的法律后，抗议活动对红筹股的影响为积极的，但对与泛民主党派有关的公司为负面的。因此，本文认为在中央政府和香港特区政府采取严厉措施阻止暴乱后，红筹股的政治关系价值变得积极，而与泛民主党派的政治关系价值变得负面。",
