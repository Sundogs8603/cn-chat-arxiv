    "translated_abstract": "具有异质性的图被认为是图神经网络（GNNs）面临挑战的情景，其中节点通过各种模式与不同的邻居相连接。本文通过将图卷积（GC）操作合并到完全连接的网络中，通过提出的异质性随机块模型（HSBM）来提供对不同异质性模式对GNNs影响的理论理解，HSBM是一个可以容纳多样的异质性模式的通用随机图模型。首先，我们展示了通过应用GC操作，可分性增益取决于两个因素，即邻域分布的欧氏距离和$\\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\operatorname{deg}\\right]}$，其中$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\operatorname{deg}\\right]$是平均节点度。它揭示了异质性对分类的影响需要与平均节点度一起评估。其次，我们展示了拓扑噪声具有负面影响",
