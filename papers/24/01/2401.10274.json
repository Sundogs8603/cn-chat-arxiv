    "translated_abstract": "随着现代炼油厂原油调度的规模扩大，出现了具有数千个二进制变量和非线性约束的大规模原油调度问题（LSCOSPs），这对于传统优化方法来说是具有挑战性的。为了解决LSCOSPs，我们以海上进口炼油厂的实际原油调度为例，从原油卸货、运输、原油蒸馏装置加工和中间产品库存管理等方面对LSCOSPs进行建模。在提出的模型的基础上，我们开发了一个由启发式规则驱动的双阶段进化算法（简称DSEA/HR），其中双阶段搜索机制包括全局搜索和局部优化。在全局搜索阶段，我们根据经验操作知识设计了几个启发式规则，以在混合变量空间中生成具有良好性能的初始种群，并加速收敛。在局部优化阶段，我们采用修复策略。",
