    "translated_abstract": "最近人工智能的进步导致了大型多模态模型（LMMs）的发展，这些模型能够处理涉及文本和图像内容的复杂任务，例如在公共场所导航地图。本文介绍了ConTextual，这是一个新颖的基准，包括专门设计的指令，用于评估LMMs在执行上下文敏感的文本富有视觉推理方面的能力。ConTextual强调了多样的现实世界场景（例如时间阅读、导航、购物等），要求更深入地理解文本和视觉元素之间的相互作用。我们的研究结果显示，最佳表现的LMM，GPT-4V(ision)，与人类能力之间存在30.8%的性能差距，使用人类评估指出在上下文敏感的文本富有视觉推理方面还有很大的改进空间。值得注意的是，虽然GPT-4V在抽象类别（如模因和引文解释）中表现出色，但其整体性能仍然落后于人类。",
