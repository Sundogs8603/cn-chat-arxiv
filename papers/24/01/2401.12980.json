    "translated_abstract": "女性谋杀是指男性伴侣或家庭成员对女性受害者的杀害，并与性别暴力有关。研究表明，在这些谋杀之前存在一种加剧的暴力模式，如果能评估受害者面临的危险程度，就有可能预防这种情况。机器学习提供了一种有前景的方法，可以基于对暴力行为的描述来预测风险水平。在本研究中，我们使用了长短期记忆（LSTM）技术来识别巴西警方报告中女性谋杀前的行为模式。我们的第一个目标是将这些报告的内容分类为受害者被谋杀的较低风险或较高风险，准确率达到了66%。在第二种方法中，我们开发了一个模型来预测受害者在一系列模式化事件中可能经历的下一步行动。这两种方法都对我们理解预防女性谋杀有所贡献。",
