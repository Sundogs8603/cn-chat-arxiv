    "translated_abstract": "自监督学习已成为一种流行的方法，用于预训练深度学习模型，并将其转移到执行下游任务。然而，大多数这些方法是针对包含清晰纹理、轮廓和明显色彩对比的大规模图像数据集开发的。尚不确定这些方法是否同样有效用于医学成像，因为感兴趣区域往往与周围组织融合不明显。在本研究中，我们提出了一种替代方法，使用对侧乳房X线片训练神经网络，以在成对包含正常图像时编码相似嵌入，在成对包含正常和异常图像时编码不同嵌入。我们的方法利用了人体自然对称性作为弱标签，以完全无监督的方式学习区分异常病变和背景组织。我们的研究结果表明，通过结合欧氏距离得出的软标签，这是可行的。",
