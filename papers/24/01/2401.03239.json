    "abstract": "This paper presents a set of reflections on saturation and the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for performing Thematic Analysis (TA). The paper suggests that initial thematic saturation (ITS) could be used as a metric to assess part of the transactional validity of TA with LLM, focusing on the initial coding. The paper presents the initial coding of two datasets of different sizes, and it reflects on how the LLM reaches some form of analytical saturation during the coding. The procedure proposed in this work leads to the creation of two codebooks, one comprising the total cumulative initial codes and the other the total unique codes. The paper proposes a metric to synthetically measure ITS using a simple mathematical calculation employing the ratio between slopes of cumulative codes and unique codes. The paper contributes to the initial body of work exploring how to perform qualitative analysis with LLMs.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文对饱和度和使用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行主题分析（TA）进行了一系列反思。本文提出初步主题饱和度（ITS）可以用作评估LLM下TA的一部分事务有效性的指标，重点是初始编码。本文呈现了两个不同规模数据集的初始编码，并反思LLM在编码过程中达到某种形式的分析饱和度。本文所提出的方法导致了创建了两个编码手册，一个包括累积初始编码的总数，另一个包括唯一编码的总数。本文提出了一种用简单数学计算（使用累积编码和唯一编码之间的斜率比）来综合度量ITS的指标。本文对于探索如何使用LLMs进行定性分析的初步研究有所贡献。",
