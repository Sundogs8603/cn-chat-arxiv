    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于图强化学习的方法,用于在线规划电动飞行器的时间表和目的地,该飞行器组成了一个跨多个垂直港口运营的城市空中移动（UAM）机队。这个机队调度问题的制定考虑了时间变化的需求、垂直港口容量、飞行器容量和空域安全准则的约束，以及起飞延误、天气引起的路线关闭和情况未知的飞行器停机时间的不确定性。这样的制定方式比现有的UAM机队规划实施更加复杂，可能增加了更多的现实性。为了解决这些复杂性，构建了一个新的策略架构，主要组成部分包括：作为图的抽象，用于编码垂直港口和飞行器机队状态的图胶囊转换网络；编码需求和乘客票价的时间序列信息的转换器层；以及使用编码器的Multi-head Attention-based解码器。",
