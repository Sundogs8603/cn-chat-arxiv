    "translated_abstract": "优化问题，特别是组合优化问题，由于其复杂性和难度而难以解决。进化和群体智能算法已成功解决这类问题，尤其是在二进制格式中。然而，由于探索和开发活动之间的平衡问题(EvE)，这种近似可能受到影响，这仍然是这个领域的主要挑战。尽管使用多个运算符进行互补使用的自适应运算符选择方案在管理EvE方面越来越受欢迎，但定制的自适应选择系统仍然是一个重要的研究议题。最近，强化学习(RL)被提出作为一种定制和塑造高度有效的自适应选择系统的方法。然而，从可伸缩性的角度来处理该问题仍然具有挑战性。本文提出了一种基于RL的新方法，用于帮助开发通用框架，以获得、处理和利用广义经验。",
