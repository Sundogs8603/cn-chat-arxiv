    "translated_abstract": "以太坊生态系统中最大可提取价值（MEV）的普遍存在导致对后者的描述为“黑暗森林”。迄今为止，对MEV的研究主要局限于纯链上MEV，即三明治攻击、循环套利和清算。在这项工作中，我们揭示了以太坊区块链上去中心化交易所（DEX）中非原子套利的普遍存在。重要的是，非原子套利利用了以太坊区块链上的DEX之间以及以太坊区块链外的交易所（即中心化交易所或其他区块链上的DEX）的价格差异。因此，非原子套利是一种涉及以太坊区块链内外行动的MEV。在我们对非原子套利的研究中，我们发现从合并到2023年10月31日，以太坊最大的五个DEX的超过四分之一的交易量可能归因于这种类型的MEV。我们进一步强调，只有十一名搜索者负责最主要的非原子套利行为。",
