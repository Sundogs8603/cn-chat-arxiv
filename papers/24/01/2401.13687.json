The diverse body of research on the relationship between aid and gross domestic product (GDP) has yielded varying results, finding evidence of both positive, negative, and negligible associations between the two. This study employs econometric techniques, namely Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares Regression (FMOLS) and the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), to explore the intricate links between innovation and different types of official development assistance (ODA) with the overarching construct of prosperity. The paper also reviews the linkages between foundational metrics, such as the rule of law, education, and economic infrastructure and services, in enabling self-sustaining prosperity. Drawing upon panel data of relevant determinants for 74 countries across the years 2013 to 2021, the study found that there was a negligible relationship",
