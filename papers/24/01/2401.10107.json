    "translated_abstract": "研究目的：多导睡眠图（PSG）目前被用作评估睡眠障碍的基准。其不舒适、不适合家庭使用以及在睡眠质量评估中引入偏差的问题需要探索更少侵入性、成本效益高和便携性的替代方法。一种有前景的候选方法是耳内脑电传感器，它在舒适性、固定电极位置、抗电磁干扰性和易于使用性方面均具有优势。本研究旨在建立一种评估耳内脑电信号与标准PSG之间相似性的方法。方法：我们评估PSG和耳内脑电推导的睡眠图之间的一致性。我们从PSG和耳内脑电信号的30秒时域和频域提取特征。我们只考虑在PSG评分员和耳内脑电评分员达成一致时的时段。我们引入一种方法来量化PSG推导和单通道耳内脑电之间的相似性。该方法包括...",
