    "translated_abstract": "外部对人工智能系统的审计被越来越多地认为是人工智能治理的一个关键机制。审计的有效性取决于审计员被授予的系统访问程度。近期对最先进的人工智能系统的审计主要依赖于黑盒访问，审计员只能查询系统并观察其输出。然而，对系统内部工作方式（例如权重、激活、梯度）的透明访问允许审计员进行更强的攻击，更全面地解释模型，并进行精细调整。同时，对其培训和部署信息的超越框架访问（例如方法论、代码、文档、超参数、数据、部署细节、内部评估结果）允许审计员审查开发过程，并设计更具针对性的评估。在本文中，我们研究了黑盒审计的局限性以及白盒和超越框架审计的优势。我们还讨论了技术和生理上的优势。",
