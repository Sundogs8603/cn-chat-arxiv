    "translated_abstract": "P2P借贷作为一种独特的融资机制，通过在线平台将借款人与放款人联系起来。然而，P2P借贷面临信息不对称的挑战，因为放款人往往缺乏足够的数据来评估借款人的信用价值。本文提出了一种新颖的方法来解决这个问题，即利用借款人在贷款申请过程中提供的文本描述。我们的方法涉及使用大型语言模型（LLM）处理这些文本描述，LLM是一种能够识别文本中的模式和语义的强大工具。将迁移学习应用于将LLM适应特定任务。我们从Lending Club数据集的分析结果显示，BERT生成的风险评分显著提高了信用风险分类器的性能。然而，基于LLM的系统固有的不透明性，以及潜在偏差的不确定性，限制了其应用。",
