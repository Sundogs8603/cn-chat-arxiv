    "translated_abstract": "设计能够部署到自动驾驶车辆上的交通平滑巡航控制器是改善交通流量、减少拥堵和提高燃油效率的关键步骤。我们通过利用田纳西州I-24高速公路上的真实轨迹数据，在一个单车道模拟中回放数据，绕过了需要仔细调整大型交通微模拟器的常见问题。使用标准的深度强化学习方法，我们训练能减少能耗的波浪平滑策略。作为代理的输入，我们观察前方车辆的速度和距离，这是大多数最近车辆上常见的本地状态，以及关于交通的下游状态的非本地观察。我们显示，在低于4%的自动驾驶车辆渗透率下，在出现很多停滞波的轨迹上，我们实现了超过15%的显著燃油节省。最后，我们分析了控制器的平滑效果，并展示了其鲁棒性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a traffic smoothing controller for autonomous vehicles using deep reinforcement learning and real-world trajectory data. By observing the speed and distance of the preceding vehicle and the downstream state of the traffic, a wave-smoothing policy that reduces energy consumption is trained, achieving significant fuel savings even at low autonomous vehicle penetration rates."
