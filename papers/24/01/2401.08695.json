    "translated_abstract": "尽管基于数据驱动的人工智能在医学图像诊断方面表现出色，但其缺乏可解释性使得将“黑盒子”融入临床工作流程变得困难。为了使从数据中学到的诊断模式对临床医生可理解，我们开发了一个可解释的模型，即知识引导诊断模型（KGDM），它提供了一个可视化的推理过程，包含基于人工智能的生物标记和具有相同诊断模式的检索病例。通过人工智能与人类的互动，KGDM将临床医生的提示融入到解释推理中，从而可能提高安全性和更准确的预测。本研究探讨了KGDM在传染性角膜炎（IK）诊断中的性能、可解释性和临床实用性，IK 是角膜失明的主要原因。 KGDM 的分类性能在一组前瞻性验证数据集、外部测试数据集和一个公开数据集上进行了评估。",
