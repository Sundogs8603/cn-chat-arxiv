    "translated_abstract": "无人机与Metaverse的协同作用正在催生一种新兴范式，称为无人机Metaverse，它创建了一个统一的生态系统，融合了物理和虚拟空间，改变了无人机的交互和虚拟探索。无人机双胞胎（UTs）作为无人机的数字孪生品，通过使其更具沉浸感、真实感和信息丰富性，革新无人机应用。UTs部署在地面基站（例如道路边缘单元（RSUs））上，并通过为无人机Metaverse用户（UMUs）提供Metaverse服务。由于无人机的动态移动性和RSUs的有限通信覆盖范围，进行实时的UT迁移至关重要，以确保UMUs的无缝沉浸式体验。然而，选择合适的RSUs并优化所需带宽对于实现可靠高效的UT迁移是具有挑战性的。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种基于修剪技术的小型机器学习Stackelberg博弈框架，以实现高效的UT迁移。",
