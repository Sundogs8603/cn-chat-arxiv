    "translated_abstract": "通用类别发现（GCD）在从未标记的数据集中识别已知和未知类别方面起着至关重要的作用，它利用了通过已标记类别集合获取的洞察力。现有的GCD方法的一个显著限制是它们假设未标记数据中的类别分布是均衡的。与这一假设相反，自然环境中的视觉类别通常表现出长尾分布，已知或普遍的类别比罕见的类别更频繁地出现。我们的研究致力于弥合这种差距，着重于长尾通用类别发现（Long-tailed GCD）范式，该范式反映了现实世界未标记数据集的固有不平衡性。针对长尾GCD所带来的独特挑战，我们提出了一种基于两个策略性正则化的强大方法:（i）一种加权机制，增强了较少出现的尾部类别的重要性。",

This paper presents a method for Long-tailed Generalized Category Discovery (Long-tailed GCD) that enhances the importance of less-occurred tail-end categories through two strategic regularizations."
