    "translated_abstract": "人类决策和情绪（特别是内疚和后悔）之间错综复杂的关系对行为和幸福感有重要影响。然而，在计算模型中往往忽视了这些情绪的微妙区别和相互作用。本文介绍了一个特定的数据集，用于剖析内疚和后悔之间的关系及其独特的文本标志，弥补了情感计算研究中的一个显著空白。我们的方法将内疚和后悔识别视为二分类任务，并采用三种机器学习和六种基于变压器的深度学习技术对新创建的数据集进行基准测试。该研究还采用了链状思维和树状思维等创新推理方法来评估模型的解释逻辑。结果表明，基于变压器的模型具有明显的性能优势，相比于最好的机器学习分类器的85.3%的宏F1分数，可以达到90.4%的宏F1分数，展示了其较强的能力。",
