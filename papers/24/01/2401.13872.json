    "translated_abstract": "随着智能化系统的迅速发展，传感器的增加显著复杂化了对系统状态的手动监测。因此，基于图的时间序列异常检测方法引起了人们的关注，因为它们能够明确表示传感器之间的关系。然而，这些方法通常在更新不同目标节点表示时，对所有连接的目标节点应用统一的源节点表示。此外，常用于推断未知图结构的图注意力机制可能限制源节点表示的多样性。本文介绍了边缘条件节点更新图神经网络（ECNU-GNN）。我们的模型配备了一个边缘条件节点更新模块，根据连接的边动态转换源节点表示以恰当地表示目标节点。我们在三个实际数据集上验证了性能：SWaT、WADI和PSM。我们的模型表现出5的性能提升。",
