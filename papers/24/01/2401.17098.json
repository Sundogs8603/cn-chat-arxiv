    "translated_abstract": "对于机器学习研究人员来说，手写字符识别（HCR）是一个具有挑战性的问题。与打印文本数据不同，手写字符数据集由于人类导致的偏差而具有更多的变化。基于独特字符类的数据，例如象形文字或汉字韩字字符序列，给HCR问题带来新的复杂性。在这种数据集上的分类任务要求模型学习具有相似特征的图像的高复杂性细节。随着计算资源的可用性的最新进展以及进一步的计算机视觉理论的发展，一些研究团队已经有效地解决了出现的挑战。尽管以高效率而闻名，但许多常见的方法仍然不具有通用性，并使用数据集特定的解决方案来取得更好的结果。由于复杂的结构和高计算需求，现有方法经常阻止解决方案流行起来。本文提出了一种方法。",
