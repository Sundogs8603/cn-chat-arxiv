    "translated_abstract": "去噪扩散模型在多个研究领域显示出巨大潜力。现有的面向全新3D分子生成的扩散基于生成方法面临两个主要挑战。由于分子中的大多数重原子通过单键与多个原子相连，仅使用成对距离来模拟分子几何是不足的。因此，第一个挑战涉及提出一个能够捕捉复杂的多体原子间关系和学习高质量特征的有效神经网络作为去噪内核。由于图的离散性质，面对分子的主流扩散方法严重依赖预定义规则，并以间接方式生成边缘。第二个挑战涉及将分子的生成与扩散相结合，并准确预测键的存在。在我们的研究中，我们认为在扩散过程中更新分子构型的迭代方式与分子动力学一致，并引入了新的方法来解决两个挑战。",
