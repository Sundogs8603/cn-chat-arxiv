    "translated_abstract": "精确估计治疗效果对于评估干预措施的有效性至关重要。虽然深度学习模型在学习治疗效果估计中的可对立表示方面展现出有希望的性能，但这些模型的一个主要局限是将整个人群视为一个同质群体，忽视具有不同治疗效果的不同子群体的多样性。这个局限限制了准确估计治疗效果和提供子群体特定治疗建议的能力。本文提出了一种名为SubgroupTE的新颖治疗效果估计模型，该模型在治疗效果估计中结合了子群识别。SubgroupTE通过考虑子群特定的因果效应，识别具有不同治疗反应的异质子群体，从而更准确地估计治疗效果。此外，SubgroupTE通过迭代优化子群分组和治疗效果估计，提高了估计的精度。",
