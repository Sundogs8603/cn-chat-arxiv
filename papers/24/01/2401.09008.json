    "translated_abstract": "步幅决定了滤波器在输入上移动时相邻位置之间的距离。固定的步幅导致无法捕捉到图像中重要的信息，从而无法对重要信息进行分类。因此，在先前的研究中，应用了DiffStride方法，即具有学习自己步幅值的步幅卷积方法。严格量化和对保留信息的约束下界在Max Pooling下采样方法中引起问题。谱池化通过在频域截断表示来降低对保留信息的约束下界。本研究提出了一种使用反向传播执行的下采样可学习步幅技术与谱池化技术相结合的CNN模型。DiffStride和谱池化技术有望保持图像中包含的大部分信息。在本研究中，我们比较了混合方法，即将DiffStride和谱池化技术结合使用。",
