    "abstract": "By using an econometric approach this paper looks at the evolution of the world wine industry in the period 1961-2005. A particular stylized fact is the appearance of nontraditional producing and exporting countries of wine from the beginning of the nineties. We show that the success of these new producing and exporting countries can be explained by the importance of the demand from non-producing countries with little or no tradition of wine consumption, relative to the world demand. This stylized fact is consistent with a testable implication of the switching cost literature and to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that this implication is tested.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文采用计量经济学方法研究了1961年至2005年间世界葡萄酒行业的发展情况。一个重要的事实是，在90年代初期出现了非传统的葡萄酒生产和出口国家。我们发现，这些新兴的生产和出口国家的成功可以通过非生产国家对葡萄酒需求的重要性来解释，这些非生产国家在葡萄酒消费方面几乎没有传统，相对于世界需求而言。这个事实符合转换成本文献的可检验推论，我们据我们所知，这是第一次对这个推论进行检验。",
