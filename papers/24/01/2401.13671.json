    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文的目的是识别马达加斯加可再生能源消费的影响因素。我们测试了宏观经济、金融、社会和环境等方面的12个特征，包括经济增长、国内投资、外国直接投资、金融发展、工业发展、通货膨胀、收入分配、贸易开放度、汇率、旅游业发展、环境质量和城市化。为了评估它们的重要性，我们假定再生能源消费与这些特征之间存在线性关系，时间跨度为1990年至2021年。接下来，我们应用了不同的机器学习特征选择算法，包括基于过滤器的（线性回归的相对重要性、相关方法），嵌入式的（LASSO），以及包装式的（最佳子集回归、逐步回归、递归特征消除、迭代预测子加权偏最小二乘法、Boruta、模拟退火和遗传算法）方法。我们的分析揭示了...",
