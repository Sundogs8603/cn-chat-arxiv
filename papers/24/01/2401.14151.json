    "translated_abstract": "尽管在众多任务中取得了令人印象深刻的表现，但大型语言模型（LLMs）在解决简单的决策任务上经常失败，原因是LLMs中的知识与环境不对齐。相反，强化学习（RL）智能体从零开始学习策略，这使得它们始终与环境保持一致，但难以将先前的知识整合到其中以进行有效的探索。为了缩小这一差距，我们提出了TWOSOME，一种新颖的在线框架，利用LLMs作为决策智能体，通过RL与具身环境高效互动并实现对齐，而无需任何准备好的数据集或环境的先前知识。首先，我们使用LLMs查询每个有效动作的联合概率以形成行为策略。然后，为了增强策略的稳定性和鲁棒性，我们提出了两种归一化方法，并总结了四个提示设计原则。最后，我们设计了一种新颖的参数高效的训练架构，其中包括一个行为评估和选择算法来提高学习效率。",

A novel parameter-efficient training architecture is also designed to improve learning efficiency."
