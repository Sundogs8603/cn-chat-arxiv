    "translated_abstract": "小型无人机系统（sUAS）已在广泛的应用领域中得到广泛应用。这引入了共享领域内的操作复杂性和报告的事件增加，引发了安全担忧。为此，美国联邦航空管理局（FAA）正在开发无人机交通管理（UTM）系统，以基于sUAS预测能够安全完成任务的能力来控制对空域的访问。然而，一个完全自动化的系统，能够快速批准或拒绝飞行请求，可能存在偏见，并必须考虑多样化利益相关者的安全性、透明性和公平性。在本文中，我们提出了一项初步研究，探讨了应考虑在自动化系统中的因素的利益相关者的观点。结果表明，飞行特征和环境条件被认为是最重要的，但飞行员和无人机的能力也应该被考虑。此外，几个受访者表示他们对使用机器学习算法批准或拒绝飞行请求的不满。",
