    "translated_abstract": "在确保自己研究的可重复性方面已经有了广泛的指导，但关于如何在自己的研究中对外部研究进行再现和复制的讨论很少。为了引发这个讨论，我们从我们重现一个用于预测热带气旋生成的运营产品的经验中提取教训，提出了一个二维框架，以提供关于再现和复制的指导。我们的框架在一个轴上表示模型拟合，在另一个轴上表示推理中的使用，依赖于数据集、度量指标和模型这三个关键方面。通过在这个二维平面上评估我们研究的轨迹，我们可以更好地说明使用我们研究得出的结论。此外，我们还使用这个框架来评估在大气科学中基准数据集的实用性。我们的二维框架为研究人员，特别是初级研究人员，提供了一个工具，使他们能够将前期工作纳入到自己的研究中，并指导研究方向。",
