    "abstract": "Large archival collections, such as email or government documents, must be manually reviewed to identify any sensitive information before the collection can be released publicly. Sensitivity classification has received a lot of attention in the literature. However, more recently, there has been increasing interest in developing sensitivity-aware search engines that can provide users with relevant search results, while ensuring that no sensitive documents are returned to the user. Sensitivity-aware search would mitigate the need for a manual sensitivity review prior to collections being made available publicly. To develop such systems, there is a need for test collections that contain relevance assessments for a set of information needs as well as ground-truth labels for a variety of sensitivity categories. The well-known Enron email collection contains a classification ground-truth that can be used to represent sensitive information, e.g., the Purely Personal and Personal but in Profes",

    "translated_abstract": "大规模的档案收藏，如电子邮件或政府文件，必须在向公众发布之前进行人工审查，以识别任何敏感信息。敏感性分类已受到文献的广泛关注。然而，最近越来越多的人开始对开发敏感度感知的搜索引擎表现出兴趣，这样可以为用户提供相关的搜索结果，同时确保不向用户返回敏感性文件。敏感度感知搜索可以减轻在档案公开之前进行手动敏感度审核的需求。为了开发这样的系统，需要包含一组信息需求的相关性评估以及多个敏感度类别的基准标签的测试集合。著名的恩龙电子邮件收集包含可以用于表示敏感信息的分类基准标签，如“纯个人”和“个人但是专业的”。",
