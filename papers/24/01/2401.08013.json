    "translated_abstract": "在交通分配中，缺乏唯一的用户均衡（UE）路径流给许多交通应用带来了重大挑战。最大熵原理通常用于解决这个挑战，它主张选择最有可能的解作为代表。基于最近提出的一种称为累积logit（CULO）的日常动态离散时间模型，本研究为最大熵UE（MEUE）路径流提供了一个新的行为支撑。已经证明CULO可以在假设旅行者不是完全理性的情况下达到UE状态。在这里，我们进一步证明了如果（i）旅行者对路径没有任何先验信息，因此被迫给予所有路径相等的选择概率，或者（ii）所有旅行者从同一信息源获取信息以满足所谓的一般比例条件，那么CULO始终会收敛到MEUE路径流。因此，CULO可以作为一个实际的解决方案。",
