    "translated_abstract": "法律文本推理的目标是确定法律查询中的断言是否逻辑上符合所提供的一个或多个法律文章中提供的信息。ChatGPT是一个大型语言模型，在许多自然语言处理任务中都表现出色，包括法律文本推理：当我们将温度设置为0（ChatGPT回答是确定性的）并提示模型时，它在COLIEE 2022数据集上的准确率达到了70.64％，超过了之前的SOTA（67.89％）。另一方面，如果温度大于零，ChatGPT的回答就不确定了，导致答案不一致和结果波动。我们提出利用标签模型（弱监督技术的基本组成部分）将ChatGPT的临时答案整合为综合标签。通过这种方式，我们将ChatGPT的临时答案视为可能带有噪声的预测，可以通过标签模型来整合。实验结果表明，这种方法可以实现准确率的提高。",
