    "abstract": "In this study, we explore the synergy of deep learning and financial market applications, focusing on pair trading. This market-neutral strategy is integral to quantitative finance and is apt for advanced deep-learning techniques. A pivotal challenge in pair trading is discerning temporal correlations among entities, necessitating the integration of diverse data modalities. Addressing this, we introduce a novel framework, Multi-modal Temporal Relation Graph Learning (MTRGL). MTRGL combines time series data and discrete features into a temporal graph and employs a memory-based temporal graph neural network. This approach reframes temporal correlation identification as a temporal graph link prediction task, which has shown empirical success. Our experiments on real-world datasets confirm the superior performance of MTRGL, emphasizing its promise in refining automated pair trading strategies.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探索了深度学习与金融市场应用之间的协同作用，重点关注配对交易。这种市场中性策略对量化金融至关重要，并且适用于先进的深度学习技术。配对交易中的一个关键挑战是辨识实体之间的时间相关性，这要求整合多样化的数据模态。为了应对这一挑战，我们介绍了一种新的框架，即多模态时间关系图学习（MTRGL）。MTRGL将时间序列数据和离散特征结合到一个时间图中，并采用了基于记忆的时间图神经网络。这种方法将时间相关性识别重新定义为一个时间图链路预测任务，取得了实证成功。我们在真实数据集上的实验验证了MTRGL的卓越性能，强调其在优化自动化配对交易策略方面的潜力。",
