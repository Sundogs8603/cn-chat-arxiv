    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶车辆具有减少人为错误导致的事故和降低道路交通风险的潜力。然而，由于重型车辆的性质，其碰撞会导致更严重的事故，因此在自动驾驶的背景下，需要考虑车辆的重量来制定降低潜在风险和后果的驾驶策略。本研究基于风险预测开发了一种自动驾驶策略，考虑周围车辆的重量，并使用分层深度强化学习。通过风险场理论提出了一个综合周围车辆重量的风险指标，并将其纳入自动驾驶决策中。设计了一个混合行动空间，允许左车道变道、右车道变道和跟车行为，使自动驾驶车辆能够在可能的情况下更自由、更真实地行动。为了解决上述混合决策问题，采用了分层近端策略优化（HPPO）算法。",
