    "translated_abstract": "由于用户需求和最近的法规（GDPR、AI法案），需要解释AI系统所做出的决策。这些决策往往只能在事后解释，反事实推理成为常见的解释方式。什么构成了最佳的反事实解释必须考虑多个方面，其中“样本距离”是最常见的。我们认为，这一要求经常会导致不太可能且因此价值有限的解释。在这里，我们提出了一个能够提供高可能性解释的系统。我们展示了使用混合整数优化（MIO）模拟寻找满足反事实推理的许多常见要求的最有可能解释。在此过程中，我们提出了Sum-Product Network（SPN）的MIO表达，并使用SPN估计反事实的可能性，这对独立的兴趣也有用。与生成反事实解释的几种方法进行数值比较。",
