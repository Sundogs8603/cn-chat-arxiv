    "translated_abstract": "点云配准作为计算机视觉中的基本问题，旨在寻找对齐一对点云的最佳变换。在大多数现有方法中，信息传递通常是正向传递，因此缺乏从高层信息到低层信息的指导。此外，过多的高层信息可能过于冗余，直接使用可能与原始低层信息发生冲突。本文提出了一种新颖的迭代反馈网络（IFNet）用于无监督点云配准，其中通过重新路由后续高层特征有效地丰富了低层特征的表示。具体而言，我们的IFNet建立在一系列反馈配准块（FRB）模块上，每个模块负责生成前向刚性变换和反馈高层特征。这些FRB模块被级联和经过时间展开。此外，反馈变换器被设计用来增强特定层级特征之间的关系",
