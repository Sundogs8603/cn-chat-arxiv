    "abstract": "In recent years, various well-designed algorithms have empowered music platforms to provide content based on one's preferences. Music genres are defined through various aspects, including acoustic features and cultural considerations. Music genre classification works well with content-based filtering, which recommends content based on music similarity to users. Given a considerable dataset, one premise is automatic annotation using machine learning or deep learning methods that can effectively classify audio files. The effectiveness of systems largely depends on feature and model selection, as different architectures and features can facilitate each other and yield different results. In this study, we conduct a comparative study investigating the performances of three models: a proposed convolutional neural network (CNN), the VGG16 with fully connected layers (FC), and an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) approach on different features: 30-second Mel spectrogram and 3-second Mel-freq",

    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，各种精心设计的算法使得音乐平台能够根据用户的喜好提供内容。音乐类型通过包括声学特征和文化考虑在内的各个方面来定义。音乐类型分类在基于内容的过滤中非常有效，它基于音乐的相似性向用户推荐内容。在给定大规模数据集的情况下，一种假设是使用机器学习或深度学习方法进行自动注释，能够有效分类音频文件。系统的有效性在很大程度上取决于特征和模型的选择，因为不同的体系结构和特征可以相互促进并产生不同的结果。在本研究中，我们进行了一项比较研究，研究了三个模型的性能：提出的卷积神经网络（CNN），带有全连接层（FC）的VGG16模型和极限梯度提升（XGBoost）方法在不同特征上的表现：30秒的梅尔频谱图和3秒的梅尔频率倒谱系数。",
    "tldr": "本研究比较了使用CNN、VGG16和XGBoost模型以及不同特征的音乐类型分类性能。结果表明，CNN在处理30秒的梅尔频谱图时表现最好，XGBoost在处理3秒的梅尔频率倒谱系数时表现最好。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study compares the performance of CNN, VGG16, and XGBoost models, as well as different features, for music genre classification. The results show that CNN performs best when processing 30-second Mel spectrograms, while XGBoost performs best when processing 3-second Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients."
