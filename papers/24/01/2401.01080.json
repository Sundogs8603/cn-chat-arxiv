We use HDB as a standard to measure adequacy of national, regional and global supply-demand balances, finding substantial but inconsistent progress toward closer alignment with dietary guidelines, with large global shortfalls in fruits, vegetables, and legumes, nuts, and seeds, and large disparities among regions in use of animal source foods. Projections show that additional investments in the supply of agricultural products would modestly accelerate improvements in adequacy where shortfalls are greatest, revealing the need for complementary investments to increase purchasing power and demand for under-consumed food groups especially in",

    "translated_abstract": "全球大部分地区仍然缺乏足够数量的所有食物类别，以便过上积极健康的生活。本研究追踪全球食物系统在与联合国机构和世界银行用于监测全球健康饮食成本和可支付性的新健康饮食篮子（HDB）的一致性方面的历史和预计变化。我们使用HDB作为标准衡量国家、地区和全球供需平衡的充足性，发现在与膳食指南更加接近的方向上取得了实质性但不一致的进展，全球水果、蔬菜、豆类和坚果、种子方面存在巨大的不足，各个地区在动物源性食物的消费上存在巨大的差异。预测显示，额外的投资于农产品供应将在最严重的不足地区略微加快充足性改善，揭示了需要通过提高购买力和对未充分消费的食物类别需求的补充性投资。",
