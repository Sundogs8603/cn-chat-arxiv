    "translated_abstract": "腹腔镜肝切除中的增强现实是一种可视化模式，它允许外科医生在腹腔镜图像上投射肿瘤和嵌入在肝脏内部的血管，以帮助定位。在这个过程中，术前从CT或MRI数据提取的3D模型被注册到术中的腹腔镜图像中。从3D-2D融合的角度来看，大多数算法利用解剖标志物来指导注册，这些标志物包括肝脏的下线、锻镰韧带和闭锁轮廓。在腹腔镜图像和3D模型中手工标记这些标志物通常是耗时且可能存在错误，特别是对于非经验丰富的用户。因此，有必要自动化这个过程，以使增强现实在手术室中能够有效使用。我们在医学影像和计算机辅助干预（MICCAI 2022）的\"术前到术中腹腔镜融合挑战\"（P2ILF）中提出了这一挑战。",
