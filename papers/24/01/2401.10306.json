    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种物理约束卷积神经网络（PC-CNN）来解决偏微分方程中两种类型的反问题，这些方程在空间和时间上都是非线性且变化的。在第一个反问题中，我们给出了受空间变化的系统误差（即偏差，也称为认识不确定性）偏移的数据。任务是从偏差数据中揭示真实状态，即PDE的解。在第二个反问题中，我们给出了PDE解的稀疏信息。任务是以高分辨率重建空间中的解。首先，我们介绍了PC-CNN，它通过简单的时间窗口方案约束PDE来处理时序数据。其次，我们分析了PC-CNN在从偏差数据中揭示解的性能。我们分析了线性和非线性对流扩散方程以及纳维-斯托克斯方程，后者描述了湍流流动的时空混沌动力学。",
