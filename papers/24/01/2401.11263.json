    "translated_abstract": "从观察数据中估计异质治疗效应（HTE）的方法主要集中在连续或二元结果上，较少关注生存结果，几乎没有关注竞争风险情景。在这项工作中，我们开发了适用于具有和没有竞争风险的生存结果的截尾无偏变换（CUTs）。使用这些CUTs将时间到事件结果转换后，对连续结果的HTE学习方法的直接应用可以产生一致估计的异质累积发生率效应、总效应和可分离直接效应。我们的CUTs可以使用比以前更多的最先进的适用于被截尾结果的HTE学习方法，特别是在竞争风险情景下。我们提供了通用的无模型学习特定oracle不等式来限制有限样本的过度风险。oracle效率结果取决于一个oracle选择器和从所有步骤中估计的干扰函数。",
