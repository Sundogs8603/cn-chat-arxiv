    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了 Weaver，我们的第一个专注于内容创作的大型语言模型（LLM）系列。Weaver 在一个精选的语料库上进行预训练，专注于提升大型语言模型的写作能力。然后，我们使用一套新颖的方法进行指导数据合成和 LLM 对齐，对 Weaver 进行创意和职业写作的微调，使其能够产生更加人类化的文本并遵循更加多样的内容创作指导。Weaver 系列包括 Weaver Mini（1.8B）、Weaver Base（6B）、Weaver Pro（14B）和 Weaver Ultra（34B）等不同大小的模型，适用于不同的应用，可以根据查询复杂度由路由代理动态分配，从而平衡响应质量和计算成本。在经过精心策划的大型语言模型写作能力评估基准上的评估结果表明，Weaver 的所有模型尺寸胜过了通用型大型语言模型。",
