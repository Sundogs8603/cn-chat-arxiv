    "translated_abstract": "实时歌词对齐的目标是将现场演唱的音频作为输入，并在演唱过程中准确找到给定歌词的位置。该任务可以在现实世界的应用中受益，比如自动为现场音乐会或歌剧生成字幕。然而，设计一个实时模型面临着挑战，因为只能使用过去的输入并在最小延迟内运行。此外，由于缺乏用于实时歌词对齐模型的数据集，先前的研究大多使用私人内部数据集进行评估，导致缺乏标准评估方法。本文提出了一个用于古典声乐表演的实时歌词对齐系统，做出了两个贡献。首先，我们通过找到音高谱图和音素后验图（PPG）的最佳组合来改进歌词对齐算法，分别捕捉唱歌声音的旋律和语音特征。其次，我们重组了舒伯特冬之旅数据集，其中包含了...",
