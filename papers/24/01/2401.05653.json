    "abstract": "This paper explores the application of Shapley Value Regression in dissecting marketing performance at channel-partner level, complementing channel-level Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM). Utilizing real-world data from the financial services industry, we demonstrate the practicality of Shapley Value Regression in evaluating individual partner contributions. Although structured in-field testing along with cooperative game theory is most accurate, it can often be highly complex and expensive to conduct. Shapley Value Regression is thus a more feasible approach to disentangle the influence of each marketing partner within a marketing channel. We also propose a simple method to derive adjusted coefficients of Shapley Value Regression and compares it with alternative approaches.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探索了在渠道合作伙伴层面利用Shapley值回归来解析营销绩效的应用，补充了渠道层面的营销组合建模（MMM）。利用来自金融服务行业的真实数据，我们展示了Shapley值回归在评估个别合作伙伴贡献方面的实用性。尽管结构化的现场测试以及合作博弈理论最为准确，但经常会非常复杂和昂贵。因此，Shapley值回归是一种更可行的方法，可以分离营销渠道中每个营销合作伙伴的影响。我们还提出了一种简单的方法来推导调整系数，将其与其他方法进行比较。",
