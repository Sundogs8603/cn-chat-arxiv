    "translated_abstract": "在审查一个角色分割方案时，一个具有说服力的方法是将该方案与供参考的中立角色分割方案集合进行比较。这些集合通过对平衡图分区进行分布采样算法生成。为了审查集合与给定方案之间的党派差异，必须确保匹配非党派标准，以便可以得出党派差异来自于偏见，而不是来自于紧凑性水平或社区保护的差异等。某些采样算法允许明确规定基于政策的方案概率分布，然而，这些算法在大型图（即角色分割空间）中的混合时间表现出较差，除了一些专门化的指标。在这项工作中，我们生成了一种多尺度并行调温方法，该方法在每个尺度上进行局部移动。局部移动使我们能够采用多种基于政策的指标。我们在康涅狄格州对我们的方法进行了评估。",
