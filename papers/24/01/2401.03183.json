    "translated_abstract": "因果推理中的可废除性意味着因果关系可以被加强或削弱。也就是说，因果关系的强度应该随着加入支持者或驳斥者而增加或减少。然而，现有的研究忽视了因果推理中的可废除性，并未在可废除环境中评估现有的因果强度度量。在这项工作中，我们提出了第一个用于研究因果推理中的可废除性的基准数据集{\\delta}-CAUSAL。{\\delta}-CAUSAL包括约11K个涵盖十个领域的事件，其中包括支持者和驳斥者的可废除因果关系对。我们进一步展示了当前的因果强度度量无法反映{\\delta}-CAUSAL中的支持者或驳斥者加入后的因果强度变化。为此，我们提出了CESAR（Causal Embedding aSsociation with Attention Rating）。",
