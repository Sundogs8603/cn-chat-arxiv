    "abstract": "When implementing hierarchical federated learning over wireless networks, scalability assurance and the ability to handle both interference and device data heterogeneity are crucial. This work introduces a learning method designed to address these challenges, along with a scalable transmission scheme that efficiently uses a single wireless resource through over-the-air computation. To provide resistance against data heterogeneity, we employ gradient aggregations. Meanwhile, the impact of interference is minimized through optimized receiver normalizing factors. For this, we model a multi-cluster wireless network using stochastic geometry, and characterize the mean squared error of the aggregation estimations as a function of the network parameters. We show that despite the interference and the data heterogeneity, the proposed scheme achieves high learning accuracy and can significantly outperform the conventional hierarchical algorithm.",

    "translated_abstract": "在无线网络上实施分层联邦学习时，可扩展性保证和处理干扰和设备数据异质性的能力至关重要。本文介绍了一种旨在应对这些挑战的学习方法，以及通过空中计算高效利用单一无线资源的可扩展传输方案。为了提供对抗数据异质性的能力，我们采用了梯度聚合。同时，通过优化接收机归一化因子，最小化了干扰的影响。为此，我们使用随机几何模型对多簇无线网络进行建模，并将聚合估计的均方误差表征为网络参数的函数。我们表明，尽管存在干扰和数据异质性，所提出的方案实现了较高的学习准确性，并且可以明显优于传统的分层算法。",
