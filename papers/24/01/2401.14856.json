    "translated_abstract": "近年来，大规模预训练多模态模型（LMM）普遍出现，将视觉和语言模态整合起来，在各种自然语言处理和计算机视觉任务中取得了相当大的成功。然而，LMM的增加规模导致了将这些模型用于下游任务的显着计算成本。因此，研究了基于提示的交互策略以更有效地对齐模态。在这种情况下，我们提出了一种受人类记忆策略启发的新型基于提示的多模态交互策略，即Memory-Inspired Temporal Prompt Interaction（MITP）。我们的方法涉及两个阶段，就像人类记忆策略一样：获取阶段和巩固激活阶段。我们利用中间层上的临时提示来模拟获取阶段，利用基于相似性的提示交互来模拟记忆巩固，使用提示生成策略来模拟记忆激活。",
