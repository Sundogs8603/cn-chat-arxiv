    "translated_abstract": "交通方式选择的决策对交通规划至关重要。虽然传统上使用离散选择模型等统计学习技术，但由于机器学习（ML）模型具有更高的预测性能，最近在交通规划者中引起了关注。然而，ML模型的黑盒特性在解释性方面存在显著挑战，限制了它们在决策和政策制定中的实际应用。本研究利用班加罗尔市$1350$个低收入和低中产阶级家庭的数据集，使用多项式逻辑模型和决策树、随机森林、极端梯度提升和支持向量机等机器学习分类器来调查交通方式选择行为的决策。在准确性方面，随机森林模型表现最佳（训练数据为$0.788$，测试数据为$0.605$），优于所有其他模型。这项研究采用了现代解释性工具，为决策制定者提供了有关交通方式选择行为的深入洞察。",
