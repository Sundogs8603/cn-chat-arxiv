    "abstract": "Forecasting speculative stock prices is essential for effective investment risk management that drives the need for the development of innovative algorithms. However, the speculative nature, volatility, and complex sequential dependencies within financial markets present inherent challenges which necessitate advanced techniques. This paper proposes a novel framework, CAB-XDE (customized attention BiLSTM-XGB decision ensemble), for predicting the daily closing price of speculative stock Bitcoin-USD (BTC-USD). CAB-XDE framework integrates a customized bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with the attention mechanism and the XGBoost algorithm. The customized BiLSTM leverages its learning capabilities to capture the complex sequential dependencies and speculative market trends. Additionally, the new attention mechanism dynamically assigns weights to influential features, thereby enhancing interpretability, and optimizing effective cost measures and volatility forecasting.

    "translated_abstract": "对投机性股票价格进行预测对于有效的投资风险管理至关重要，这需要开发创新的算法。然而，金融市场的投机性质、波动性以及复杂的序列依赖关系都带来了固有的挑战，因此需要先进的技术。本文提出了一种新的框架CAB-XDE（自定义注意力BiLSTM-XGB决策集成），用于预测投机性股票Bitcoin-USD（BTC-USD）的每日收盘价。CAB-XDE框架将自定义的双向长短期记忆（BiLSTM）与注意力机制和XGBoost算法相结合。自定义的BiLSTM利用其学习能力捕捉复杂的序列依赖关系和投机市场趋势。此外，新的注意力机制动态分配权重给具有影响力的特征，从而增强解释性，并优化有效的成本测度和波动性预测。",
