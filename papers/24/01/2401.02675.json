    "translated_abstract": "预计下一代通信将是智能通信，可取代传统的符号通信，其中高度压缩的语义信息将考虑源和通道，并以高效率提取和传输。近年来，受欢迎的大型模型如GPT4和增强学习技术为智能通信奠定了坚实的基础，并促使其在不久的将来得以实际部署。鉴于多模态大型语言模型的“训练一次，广泛使用”的特点，我们认为按需付费的服务模式将适用于这种背景，称为Large Model as a Service (LMaaS)。然而，由于异构和动态的客户环境，交易和定价问题非常复杂，使得寻找即时解决方案的定价优化问题具有挑战性。本文旨在填补这一空白，将LMaaS市场交易形式化为Stackelberg博弈。",
