    "translated_abstract": "最近，低资源对话状态跟踪（DST）越来越受到关注。首先获取状态值，然后基于值来生成槽位类型在这项任务中取得了很大进展。然而，获取状态值仍然是一个未被深入研究的问题。现有的基于抽取的方法无法捕捉需要上下文理解的值，并且也不具有泛化性。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种基于状态值生成的新框架（SVAG），将DST分解为状态值生成和领域槽生成。具体而言，我们提出了生成状态值的方法，并使用自训练进一步改善状态值生成。此外，我们设计了一个估计器，旨在在自训练期间检测不完整生成和错误生成的伪标签数据选择。在MultiWOZ 2.1数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的方法只有不到10亿个参数，就实现了最先进的性能。",
