Specifically, the ad auction determines which ad is displayed and the corresponding payment, while the ad allocation decides the display positions of the advertisement and organic items. The prevalent methods of segregating the ad auction and allocation into two distinct stages face two problems: 1) Ad auction does not consider externalities, such as the influence of actual display position and context on ad Click-Through Rate (CTR); 2) The ad allocation, which utilizes the auction-winning ad's payment to determine the display position dynamically, fails to maintain incentive compatibility (IC) for the advertisement.

    "translated_abstract": "为了响应每个用户的页面请求，电子商务平台通常呈现一个有序列表，其中包含几个有机物品和一个广告。这个列表是广告拍卖和分配过程的结果，直接影响平台的广告收入和总交易额。广告拍卖确定显示的广告和相应的支付，而广告分配决定广告和有机物品的显示位置。目前的方法将广告拍卖和分配分为两个不同的阶段，面临两个问题：1）广告拍卖没有考虑外部性，如实际显示位置和上下文对广告点击率的影响；2）广告分配利用拍卖获胜广告的支付来动态确定显示位置，未能保持广告的激励兼容性。例如，在使用传统的广义二价(GSP)拍卖阶段，广告分配阶段无法维持激励兼容性。",
