    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们提出了一种通过伴随方法来发现给定数据的潜在偏微分方程（PDEs）的方法。我们的思路是以一般形式考虑参数化的PDE，并制定最小化PDE解与数据误差的优化问题。利用变分计算，我们得到了拉格朗日乘子（伴随方程）的演化方程，使我们能够直接计算出与PDE参数相关的目标函数的梯度。特别是对于一族参数化和非线性PDEs，我们展示了如何推导出相应的伴随方程。我们在这里展示了，在给定光滑数据集的情况下，所提出的伴随方法可以以机器精度恢复真实的PDE。然而，在存在噪声的情况下，伴随方法的准确性与著名的PDE-FIND（Rudy et al., 2017）方法相当。",
