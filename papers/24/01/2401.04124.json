    "translated_abstract": "现在以大型语言模型（LLM）为中心的代理能够为用户自动化移动设备操作。在针对学习用户的移动操作进行微调后，这些代理可以在线遵循高级用户指令。它们执行目标分解、子目标序列化和交互式环境探索等任务，直到实现最终目标。然而，在移动操作中存在与个性化用户数据相关的隐私问题，需要用户确认。此外，用户的真实操作是探索性的，行动数据复杂且冗余，给代理学习带来挑战。为了解决这些问题，在我们的实际应用中，我们设计了代理与人之间的交互任务，以识别敏感信息并与个性化用户需求对齐。此外，我们在模型的上下文学习中集成了标准操作规程（SOP）信息，以增强代理的理解能力。",
