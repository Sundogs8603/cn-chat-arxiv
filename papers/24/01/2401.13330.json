    "translated_abstract": "早期退出神经网络（EENNs）为标准的深度神经网络（DNN）配备早期退出分类器（EECs），在处理的中间点上提供足够的分类置信度时进行预测。这在效果和效率方面带来了许多好处。目前，EENNs的设计是由专家手动完成的，这是一项复杂和耗时的任务，需要考虑许多方面，包括正确的放置、阈值设置和EECs的计算开销。因此，研究正在探索使用神经架构搜索（NAS）自动化设计EENNs。目前，文献中提出了几个完整的NAS解决方案用于EENNs，并且一个完全自动化的综合设计策略，同时考虑骨干和EECs仍然是一个未解决的问题。为此，本研究呈现了面向硬件受限的早期退出神经网络的神经架构搜索（NACHOS）。",
