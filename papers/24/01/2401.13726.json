    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating multiple responses to a single prompt, yet little effort has been expended to help end-users or system designers make use of this capability. In this paper, we explore how to present many LLM responses at once. We design five features, which include both pre-existing and novel methods for computing similarities and differences across textual documents, as well as how to render their outputs. We report on a controlled user study (n=24) and eight case studies evaluating these features and how they support users in different tasks. We find that the features support a wide variety of sensemaking tasks and even make tasks previously considered to be too difficult by our participants now tractable. Finally, we present design guidelines to inform future explorations of new LLM interfaces.",

    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型能够对单个提示生成多种回应，然而很少有研究工作花费在帮助最终用户或系统设计者利用这种能力上。本文探讨了如何同时呈现多个大规模语言模型的回应。我们设计了五个功能，其中包括计算文本文档之间相似性和差异性的现有和新颖方法，以及如何呈现它们的输出。我们拥有一项受控用户研究（n=24）和八个案例研究，评估了这些功能以及它们如何支持用户进行不同任务。我们发现这些功能支持各种理解任务，甚至使以前被参与者认为过于困难的任务变得可行。最后，我们提出了设计指南，以指导未来对新的大规模语言模型接口的探索。",
