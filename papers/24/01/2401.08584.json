    "abstract": "In this paper, for the first time, a method is presented that can provide a fully automated surgery based on software and computer vision techniques. Then, the advantages and challenges of computerization of medical surgery are examined. Finally, the surgery related to isolated ovarian endometriosis disease has been examined, and based on the presented method, a more detailed algorithm is presented that is capable of automatically diagnosing and treating this disease during surgery as proof of our proposed method where a U-net is trained to detect the endometriosis during surgery.",
