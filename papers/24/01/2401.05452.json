    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了两种新颖的深度学习模型，用于使用单点光电脉搏图(PPG)信号无袖合成动脉血压(ABP)波形。我们利用公共的UCI数据集对无袖血压估计进行了训练和评估。首先，我们实现了一个包含位置编码、多头注意力、层归一化和dropout技术的Transformer模型，并以14的平均绝对误差(MAE)合成ABP波形。其次，我们实现了一种频域学习方法，在这种方法中，我们首先获取PPG和ABP信号对应于两个心脏周期的离散余弦变换(DCT)系数，然后学习它们之间的线性/非线性回归。我们发现，频域线性/非线性回归模型在舒张压(DBP)和收缩压(SBP)方面的MAE分别为11.87和8.01，优于Transformer模型。",
