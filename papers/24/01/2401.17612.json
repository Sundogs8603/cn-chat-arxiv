    "translated_abstract": "最近图神经网络（GNN）的进展已经导致了图数据建模的显著增长，用于包含各种类型节点和边的多模态数据。尽管最近已经开发了一些用于网络结构化数据的综合预测解决方案，但这些方法存在一些限制。对于涉及多模态数据的节点分类任务，某些数据模态在预测一个类时表现更好，而其他数据模态可能在预测不同类别时表现出色。因此，为了获得更好的学习表示，需要先进的计算方法来进行多模态数据的综合分析。此外，现有的综合工具缺乏对其特定预测背后原理的全面和连贯理解，使其无法用于提高模型的可解释性。为了解决这些限制，我们引入了一种新的用于多模态数据网络的综合神经网络方法，名为综合图卷积网络（IGCN）。",
