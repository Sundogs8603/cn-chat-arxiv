    "translated_abstract": "通过对行星反照率的影响，云层在全球温度调节中起到重要作用。人为气溶胶排放可以改变云层的反照率，但这种影响的程度以及对温度变化的影响仍不确定。由船舶气溶胶排放引起的人为云层，通常称为船舶路径，提供了与相邻云层区域有所不同的可见效果，因此可用作研究人为云层的有用样本。然而，缺乏大规模船舶路径数据使得很难推测其对云层形成的总体影响。为了开发自动定位船舶路径的大规模方法，我们提出了CloudTracks，一个包含3560个卫星图像并标记了12000多个船舶路径实例注释的数据集。我们在我们的数据集上训练了语义分割和实例分割模型基线，并发现我们的最佳模型明显优于先前的统计模型。",
