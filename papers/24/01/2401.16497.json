    "translated_abstract": "从高维数据中提取有意义的信息是一个具有挑战性的建模问题，特别是当数据被噪声干扰或以不同的模态表示时。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种新颖的非参数建模方法，利用高斯过程（GP）将高维数据映射到潜在的低维流形上。这个模型被命名为潜在判别生成解码器（LDGD），它在流形发现过程中利用了数据（或其特征）和相关标签（如类别或刺激）。为了推断潜在变量，我们提供了一个贝叶斯解，使得LDGD能够有效地捕捉数据中的内在不确定性，同时提高模型的预测准确性和鲁棒性。我们在合成数据集和基准数据集上演示了LDGD的应用。LDGD不仅能准确地推断流形，而且在预测标签方面的准确性超过了最先进的方法。",
