    "translated_abstract": "现有的目标识别模型在不同地理情景下缺乏鲁棒性，这是由于设计和环境中存在重要的领域转移。为了更准确地反映这些转移下的对象概念，需要调整类别表示。在缺乏目标地理位置训练数据的情况下，我们假设可以利用地理特定的对象类别描述性知识来增强鲁棒性。为此，我们探索了通过探测大型语言模型的地理特定对象知识的可行性，并研究了在CLIP视觉语言模型中集成知识的零样本和可学习软提示。特别地，我们提出了一种地理知识正则化方法，以确保在一组源地理位置上训练的软提示能够推广到未见过的目标地理位置集合。当仅依赖来自欧洲的数据进行训练时，我们在DollarStreet上的增益达到了+2.8个国家。",
