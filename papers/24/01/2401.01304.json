    "translated_abstract": "本文验证了一种基于传感器融合的全球导航卫星系统（GNSS）欺骗攻击检测框架在自动驾驶车辆中的性能。通过配备GNSS接收器和惯性测量单元（IMU）的车辆收集数据。该检测框架采用两种策略：第一种策略通过比较预测的位置偏移（即两个连续时间戳之间的行驶距离）与惯性传感器的位置偏移来进行。为此，将来自低成本车辆内的加速度计和陀螺仪传感器的数据融合并输入到长短期记忆（LSTM）神经网络中。第二种策略采用随机森林监督机器学习模型，利用转向角传感器的输出来检测和分类转弯，并区分左转和右转。在实验中还模拟了两种类型的欺骗攻击模型：一步步转弯和错误转弯。",
