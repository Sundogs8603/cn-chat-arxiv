Through a comparative analysis in Oaxaca, Mexico; La Plata, Argentina; and Araucania, Chile, this research sheds light on the vital role that grassroots innovation plays in broader economic ecosystems. Using Complex Network Analysis and the TE-SER model, the study unveils how these actors interact, collaborate, and influence major economic ecosystems in the context of complex social challenges. The findings highlight that actors from the grassroots innovation ecosystem make up a significant portion of the larger innovation-driven entrepreneurial economic ecosystem, accounting for between 20% and 30% in all three cases and are strategically positioned within the ecosystem's structural network. Additionally, this study emphasizes the potential for greater integration of grassroots innovation actors to leverage resources and foster socio-economic development. The resea",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究对基层创新参与者及其在更大经济生态系统中的整合进行了考察。通过在墨西哥瓦加斯州、阿根廷拉普拉塔和智利阿劳卡尼亚地区进行比较分析，这项研究揭示了基层创新在更广泛经济生态系统中所起的重要作用。利用复杂网络分析和TE-SER模型，研究揭示了这些参与者在复杂社会挑战环境下如何相互作用、合作和影响主要经济生态系统。研究结果表明，基层创新生态系统的参与者在整个以创新驱动的企业经济生态系统中占据重要位置，三个案例中比例在20%至30%之间，并且在系统的结构网络中具有战略地位。此外，本研究强调了更好整合基层创新参与者以利用资源和促进社经发展的潜力。",
