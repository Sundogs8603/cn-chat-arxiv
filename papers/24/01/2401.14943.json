    "abstract": "Macroeconomic factors have a critical impact on banking credit risk, which cannot be directly controlled by banks, and therefore, there is a need for an early credit risk warning system based on the macroeconomy. By comparing different predictive models (traditional statistical and machine learning algorithms), this study aims to examine the macroeconomic determinants impact on the UK banking credit risk and assess the most accurate credit risk estimate using predictive analytics. This study found that the variance-based multi-split decision tree algorithm is the most precise predictive model with interpretable, reliable, and robust results. Our model performance achieved 95% accuracy and evidenced that unemployment and inflation rate are significant credit risk predictors in the UK banking context. Our findings provided valuable insights such as a positive association between credit risk and inflation, the unemployment rate, and national savings, as well as a negative relationship bet",

    "translated_abstract": "宏观经济因素对银行信贷风险有着重要影响，这些因素无法被银行直接控制，因此需要一个基于宏观经济的早期信贷风险预警系统。通过比较不同的预测模型（传统统计和机器学习算法），本研究旨在考察宏观经济因素对英国银行信贷风险的影响，并利用预测分析评估最准确的信贷风险估计。研究发现，基于方差的多切分决策树算法是具有可解释性、可靠性和鲁棒性的最精确的预测模型。我们的模型性能达到了95%的准确率，并证明了失业率和通货膨胀率在英国银行业环境中是重要的信贷风险预测因子。我们的研究结果提供了有价值的洞察，如信贷风险与通货膨胀、失业率和国民储蓄之间的正向关联，以及负相关的关系。",
