    "translated_abstract": "虽然作为启发于物理学的、基于能量的和生成性质的模型，普通玻尔兹曼机被认为难以训练。这种观点导致了对玻尔兹曼机的简化，如限制层内连接或逐层训练的深度玻尔兹曼机。而最近发展的面向特定领域的硬件（具体地说是具有概率位的概率计算机）可能改变对深度玻尔兹曼机可训练性的认知。本文展示了如何利用生成十亿亿马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛采样率的概率计算机在最初用于D-Wave的原有稀疏网络上训练深度且无限制的玻尔兹曼机。为了最大化概率计算机的学习效率，我们引入了两类均场理论辅助学习算法，即xMFTs（x = Naive和Hierarchical）。xMFTs用于估计对比散度正相位中的平均值和相关性。",
