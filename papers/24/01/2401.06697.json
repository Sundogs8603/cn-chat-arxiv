    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative brain disorder, which results in significant cognitive impairments, especially in the elderly population. Cognitive impairments can manifest as a decline in various mental faculties, such as concentration, memory, and other higher-order cognitive abilities. These deficits can significantly impact an individual's capacity to comprehend information, acquire new knowledge, and communicate effectively. One of the affected activities due to cognitive impairments is handwriting. By analyzing different aspects of handwriting, including pressure, velocity, and spatial organization, researchers can detect subtle alterations that might indicate early-stage cognitive impairments, especially AD. Recently, several classical artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been proposed for detecting AD in elderly individuals through handwriting analysis.

    "translated_abstract": "阿尔茨海默病(AD)是最常见的神经退行性脑疾病，导致老年人中显著的认知功能损害。认知功能损害可以表现为各种心理能力的下降，如注意力、记忆和其他高级认知能力。这些缺陷会严重影响个体理解信息、获取新知识和有效沟通的能力。其中受到认知功能损害影响的活动之一是书写。通过分析书写的不同方面，包括压力、速度和空间组织，研究人员可以检测到细微的变化，可能表明早期的认知功能损害，特别是AD。最近，已经提出了几种经典的人工智能(AI)方法，通过书写分析来检测老年人中的AD。然而，先进的AI方法需要更多的计算能力，因为数据的规模增加了。",
