    "translated_abstract": "在软件工程中，问题报告的有效排序对于优化资源分配和及时解决关键问题至关重要。然而，手动对问题报告进行分类以进行排序是费力且缺乏可伸缩性的。相反，许多开源软件项目使用自动化流程解决此问题，尽管需要大量的数据集进行充分的训练。这项研究旨在设计一种自动化方法，在使用较小的数据集进行训练时仍能确保问题排序的可靠性。我们提出的方法利用生成式预训练转换器（GPT）的能力，认识到它们在处理这个任务时的高效性。通过利用这样的模型的能力，我们的目标是开发一个准确优先级问题报告的可靠系统，降低对大量训练数据的需求，同时保持可靠性。在我们的研究中，我们已经开发了一个可靠的基于GPT的方法来准确标记问题报告。",
