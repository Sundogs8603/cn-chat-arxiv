    "translated_abstract": "从磁共振（MR）图像中手动划定肿瘤区域耗时、需要专家，并容易出现人为错误。近年来，深度学习模型已成为脑肿瘤分割的首选方法。U-Net及其变种在医学图像语义分割领域取得了良好结果。然而，U-Net及其变种倾向于过分分割肿瘤区域，可能无法准确划分肿瘤边缘。对于准确诊断、手术精度和治疗规划，肿瘤边缘与肿瘤区域同样重要。在本文中，作者旨在利用类似导数的滤波器从实际情况中提取边缘，然后进行边缘重建，以获得边缘的真实情况，除了脑肿瘤的真实情况。利用这两个真实情况，作者研究了几种U-Net及其变种结构，有些以及没有肿瘤边缘真实情况作为目标与肿瘤真实情况一起研究。",
