    "abstract": "Poker is in the family of imperfect information games unlike other games such as chess, connect four, etc which are perfect information game instead. While many perfect information games have been solved, no non-trivial imperfect information game has been solved to date. This makes poker a great test bed for Artificial Intelligence research. In this paper we firstly compare Game theory optimal poker to Exploitative poker. Secondly, we discuss the intricacies of abstraction techniques, betting models, and specific strategies employed by successful poker bots like Tartanian[1] and Pluribus[6]. Thirdly, we also explore 2-player vs multi-player games and the limitations that come when playing with more players. Finally, this paper discusses the role of machine learning and theoretical approaches in developing winning strategies and suggests future directions for this rapidly evolving field.",

    "translated_abstract": "扑克是一种不完全信息游戏，与国际象棋、四连棋等完全信息游戏不同。虽然许多完全信息游戏已经被解决，但迄今为止还没有解决任何非平凡的不完全信息游戏。这使得扑克成为人工智能研究的极好试验平台。本文首先比较了博弈论最优扑克和剥削扑克。其次，我们讨论了抽象技术、投注模型和成功的扑克机器人（如Tartanian[1]和Pluribus[6]）所采用的特定策略的复杂性。第三，我们还探讨了2人对多人游戏的差异以及与玩更多玩家时出现的局限性。最后，本文讨论了机器学习和理论方法在开发获胜策略中的作用，并提出了这一快速发展领域的未来发展方向。",
