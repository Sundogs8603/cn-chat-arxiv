    "translated_abstract": "鉴于当代社会系统日益复杂和多层次的特性，手动生成解决相关社会问题的解决方案已成为一项艰巨的任务。为了应对这一挑战，人工智能的快速发展推动了计算方法的探索，旨在自动生成解决方案。然而，目前的自动生成解决方案的方法主要集中在涉及特定场景的局部社会规定。在这里，我们报告了一个专为通用社会解决方案生成而设计的自动社会操作系统（ASOS），该系统建立在基于代理模型的基础上，能够在时空维度上对社会问题进行全局和局部的分析与规定。ASOS采用可扩展的社会语义的超图，以全面和结构化的方式表示社会动态。它还结合了用于标准化超图操作的通用协议和符号化的混合策略。",
