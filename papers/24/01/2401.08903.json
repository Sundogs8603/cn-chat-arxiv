    "translated_abstract": "人脸识别系统上的对抗攻击可以分为两种类型：冒名顶替攻击和躲避攻击。我们观察到，在黑盒设置中成功进行冒名顶替攻击并不一定能保证在人脸识别系统上成功进行躲避攻击。本文提出了一种名为预训练修剪恢复攻击（PPR）的新型攻击方法，旨在增强躲避攻击的性能同时避免冒名顶替攻击的降级。我们的方法利用对抗样本修剪，可以将一部分对抗扰动设为零，并倾向于保持攻击性能。通过利用对抗样本修剪，我们可以修剪预训练的对抗样本，并有选择性地释放某些对抗扰动。然后，我们将对抗扰动嵌入到修剪区域，从而增强对抗人脸样本的躲避性能。通过实验证明了我们提出的攻击方法的有效性。",
