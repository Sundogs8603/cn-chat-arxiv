    "translated_abstract": "波动方程是一种重要的物理偏微分方程，在近年来，深度学习已经展示出在加速或替代传统数值方法中解决波动方程方面的潜力。然而，现有的深度学习方法存在着高数据获取成本、低训练效率以及对边界条件的不充分泛化能力。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种基于有限差分残差约束的波动方程无监督学习方法。我们构建了一种基于结构化网格和有限差分方法的新型有限差分残差约束，以及一种无监督训练策略，使卷积神经网络可以在无数据的情况下进行训练并预测波的前向传播过程。实验结果表明，有限差分残差约束相对于基于物理信息约束的物理感知神经网络（PINNs）具有更好的适应性和更低的拟合成本。",
