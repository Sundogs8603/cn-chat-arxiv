    "abstract": "The Chief Complaint (CC) is a crucial component of a patient's medical record as it describes the main reason or concern for seeking medical care. It provides critical information for healthcare providers to make informed decisions about patient care. However, documenting CCs can be time-consuming for healthcare providers, especially in busy emergency departments. To address this issue, an autocompletion tool that suggests accurate and well-formatted phrases or sentences for clinical notes can be a valuable resource for triage nurses. In this study, we utilized text generation techniques to develop machine learning models using CC data. In our proposed work, we train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and fine-tune three different variants of Biomedical Generative Pretrained Transformers (BioGPT), namely microsoft/biogpt, microsoft/BioGPT-Large, and microsoft/BioGPT-Large-PubMedQA. Additionally, we tune a prompt by incorporating exemplar CC sentences, utilizing the OpenAI API of GPT",

    "translated_abstract": "主要症状（CC）是患者医疗记录的关键组成部分，它描述了寻求医疗保健的主要原因或关注点。它为医疗保健提供者提供了关键信息，以便做出有根据的患者护理决策。然而，为医疗保健提供者记录CC可能耗时，尤其是在繁忙的急诊科。为了解决这个问题，在临床记录中为三级护理人员提供准确和格式良好的短语或句子的自动补全工具可以成为宝贵的资源。在本研究中，我们利用文本生成技术使用CC数据开发了机器学习模型。在我们的提议中，我们训练了一个长短期记忆（LSTM）模型，并微调了三种不同变种的生物医学生成预训练变压器（BioGPT），分别是microsoft/biogpt，microsoft/BioGPT-Large和microsoft/BioGPT-Large-PubMedQA。此外，我们通过结合典型的CC句子，利用GPT的OpenAI API来调整提示。",
