    "translated_abstract": "由于天气的混沌性质，天气预报旨在预测未来状态的分布而不是做出单个预测。最近，出现了多个数据驱动的天气模型，声称在技术上取得了突破。然而，这些模型大多使用确定性技能评分进行基准测试，对它们的概率技能知之甚少。不幸的是，在概率意义上公平比较AI天气模型是困难的，因为集合初始化的选择、状态定义和噪声注入方法的变化会产生混淆。此外，考虑到所涉及的数据量，即使是获得集合预报的基线也是一个巨大的工程挑战。为了解决这两个问题，我们采用了几十年前的概念 - 滞后集合，通过一个适度规模的确定性预测库构建集合。这允许对领先的AI天气模型的概率技能进行第一个无参数比较，并与操作基准进行对比。",
