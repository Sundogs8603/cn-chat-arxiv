    "abstract": "This work aims to address an open problem in data valuation literature concerning the efficient computation of Data Shapley for weighted $K$ nearest neighbor algorithm (WKNN-Shapley). By considering the accuracy of hard-label KNN with discretized weights as the utility function, we reframe the computation of WKNN-Shapley into a counting problem and introduce a quadratic-time algorithm, presenting a notable improvement from $O(N^K)$, the best result from existing literature. We develop a deterministic approximation algorithm that further improves computational efficiency while maintaining the key fairness properties of the Shapley value. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate WKNN-Shapley's computational efficiency and its superior performance in discerning data quality compared to its unweighted counterpart.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在解决数据评估文献中关于加权K最近邻算法的数据Shapley值（WKNN-Shapley）高效计算的问题。通过将硬标签KNN的准确度与离散权重视为效用函数，我们将WKNN-Shapley值的计算转化为一个计数问题，并引入了一个二次时间复杂度的算法，从而实现了对现有文献中O(N^K)的最佳结果的显著改进。我们开发了一个确定性近似算法，进一步提高了计算效率，同时保持了Shapley值的关键公平性质。通过大量实验，我们展示了WKNN-Shapley值的计算效率以及与未加权版本相比在判断数据质量方面的优势。",
