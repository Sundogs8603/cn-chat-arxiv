    "translated_abstract": "最近大规模语言模型（LLMs）的进展为聊天机器人的发展提供了新的途径，而大部分现有研究主要集中在单用户的聊天机器人上，重点放在用户输入后决定“回答什么”。在本文中，我们发现多用户聊天机器人有更复杂的3W设计维度——如何回答，“何时”回应，“回答谁”。此外，我们提出了一个名为Multi-User Chat Assistant (MUCA)的基于LLM的聊天机器人框架，专门用于群组讨论。MUCA由三个主要模块组成：子主题生成器，对话分析器和话语策略仲裁器。这些模块共同确定合适的回应内容、时机和适当的接收者。为了使MUCA的优化过程更容易，我们进一步提出了一个基于LLM的多用户模拟器（MUS），可以模拟真实用户行为。这使得聊天机器人和模拟用户之间的对话进行更快速的模拟，从而使得早期测试和优化过程更高效。",
