    "translated_abstract": "在实际应用中，数值解各种偏微分方程（PDE）通常需要大量的计算时间、能量消耗和硬件资源。这限制了它们在许多场景（如自主系统、超音速流动）中的应用，这些场景具有有限的能源预算和需要近实时响应。利用光学计算，本文开发了一个芯片上的物理相关神经网络（PINN）训练框架，旨在使用fJ/MAC光子功耗和超低延迟解决高维PDE。尽管光学神经网络具有超高速度，但在光学芯片上训练PINN是困难的，原因是（1）光子设备的尺寸较大，（2）缺乏可扩展的光学存储设备来存储反向传播过程的中间结果。为了实现实际的光学PINN训练，本文提出了一种可扩展的方法来避免反向传播过程。我们还采用张量压缩方法来提高收敛性和可扩展性。",
