    "translated_abstract": "深度网络(DNs)的一个富有成果的表述方式是通过分段仿射样条来实现，它既能够进行理论研究，又能为从业者提供实践指导。在这个领域中，一个DN的输入映射被表达为按区域的仿射映射，其中这些区域由模型的架构隐式确定，并形成它们的输入空间的一个分区。迄今为止，这个分区——这个研究线中产生的所有结果都涉及到它——只在DN的输入空间的$2/3$维切片上计算过，或者通过随机抽样进行估计。在本文中，我们提出了第一个能够精确枚举DN分区区域的并行算法。所提出的算法最终能够对常用的近似方法进行评估，例如基于DN输入空间的随机抽样。我们的一个重要发现是，如果只对具有“大”体积的区域感兴趣，那么对空间进行均匀抽样非常高效。",
