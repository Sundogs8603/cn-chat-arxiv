    "translated_abstract": "近期使用大型语言模型（LLMs）作为实际应用中的智能代理的趋势强调了对它们能力的全面评估的必要性，特别是在涉及规划、创造和使用工具的复杂场景中。然而，现有的基准测试通常只关注简单合成的查询，不反映实际复杂性，因此在评估工具利用方面的视角有限。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个新颖的基准测试UltraTool，旨在改善和评估LLMs在实际场景中工具利用的能力。UltraTool关注使用工具的整个过程——从规划和创建到在复杂任务中应用。它强调实际的复杂性，要求准确的多步规划以实现有效的问题解决。UltraTool的一个关键特点是在工具使用之前针对自然语言进行独立评估的规划，从而简化了任务解决的过程。",
