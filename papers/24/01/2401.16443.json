    "abstract": "As VR devices become more prevalent in the consumer space, VR applications are likely to be increasingly used by users unfamiliar with VR. Detecting the familiarity level of a user with VR as an interaction medium provides the potential of providing on-demand training for acclimatization and prevents the user from being burdened by the VR environment in accomplishing their tasks. In this work, we present preliminary results of using deep classifiers to conduct automatic detection of familiarity with VR by using hand tracking of the user as they interact with a numeric passcode entry panel to unlock a VR door. We use a VR door as we envision it to the first point of entry to collaborative virtual spaces, such as meeting rooms, offices, or clinics. Users who are unfamiliar with VR will have used their hands to open doors with passcode entry panels in the real world. Thus, while the user may not be familiar with VR, they would be familiar with the task of opening the door. Using a pilot d",

    "translated_abstract": "随着虚拟现实设备在消费领域的普及，对于对虚拟现实不熟悉的用户而言，虚拟现实应用的使用可能越来越普遍。检测用户对虚拟现实的熟悉程度作为交互媒介，具有通过提供按需培训进行适应和防止用户在完成任务时被虚拟现实环境所拖累的潜力。本文介绍了使用深度分类器进行自动检测用户对虚拟现实的熟悉程度的初步结果，通过用户使用手部与虚拟现实门锁数字密码输入面板进行交互来解锁虚拟现实门。我们将虚拟现实门作为企业虚拟空间的第一入口点，例如会议室、办公室或诊所。对于不熟悉虚拟现实的用户而言，在现实世界中已经使用过手部打开带有密码输入面板的门。因此，虽然用户可能对虚拟现实不熟悉，但他们对打开门的任务应该是熟悉的。使用 pilot d",
