    "translated_abstract": "室内设计是关于创造看起来和感觉良好的空间的。然而，审美偏好的主观性质在定义和量化何为室内设计视觉吸引力方面提出了重大挑战。本论文通过引入一种新的方法论来量化和预测室内设计的审美偏好来填补这一差距。我们的研究将模糊逻辑与图像处理技术相结合。我们从社交媒体平台收集了一组室内设计图像数据集，关注颜色和谐度、亮度和复杂度等基本视觉属性。我们使用加权平均法整合这些特征以计算一个总体审美得分。我们的方法在计算整体审美偏好时考虑个人颜色偏好。我们首先收集用户对红色、棕色等主要颜色的评分，以了解他们的偏好。然后，我们使用图像中前五个主导颜色的像素计数来得到",
