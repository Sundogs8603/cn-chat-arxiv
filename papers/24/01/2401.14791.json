    "abstract": "We analyze the effects of enforcing vs. exempting access ISP from net neutrality regulations when platforms are present and operate two-sided pricing in their business models. This study is conducted in a scenario where users and Content Providers (CPs) have access to the internet by means of their serving ISPs and to a platform that intermediates and matches users and CPs, among other service offerings. Our hypothesis is that platform two-sided pricing interacts in a relevant manner with the access ISP, which may be allowed (an hypothetical non-neutrality scenario) or not (the current neutrality regulation status) to apply two-sided pricing on its service business model. We preliminarily conclude that the platforms are extracting surplus from the CPs under the current net neutrality regime for the ISP, and that the platforms would not be able to do so under the counter-factual situation where the ISPs could apply two-sided prices.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们分析了强制执行与豁免访问ISP免受网络中立规定的影响，当存在平台并且在其商业模式中进行双边定价。本研究在用户和内容提供商（CPs）通过他们的服务ISP和平台获得互联网访问的情况下进行。我们的假设是平台的双边定价与访问ISP以一种相关的方式互动，访问ISP可能被允许（假设非中立情景）或不被允许（当前中立调控状态）在其服务商业模式中应用双边定价。我们初步得出结论，平台在当前网络中立制度下从CPs中提取了过剩价值，而在假设情景中，即ISP可以应用双边定价的情况下，平台则无法这样做。",
