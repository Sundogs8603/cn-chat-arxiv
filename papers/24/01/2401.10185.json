    "translated_abstract": "基于传感器的人体活动识别（HAR）是一个活跃的研究领域，因其在智能环境、辅助生活、健身和医疗等方面的应用而获得了广泛关注。最近，基于深度学习的端到端训练在计算机视觉和自然语言等领域取得了最先进的性能，其中有大量注释数据可用。然而，对于基于传感器的HAR来说，大量注释数据是不可用的。此外，HAR所执行的真实世界环境在传感器模态、分类任务和目标用户方面存在差异。为了解决这个问题，迁移学习得到了广泛应用。在这项调查中，我们重点关注智能家居和可穿戴设备基于HAR的迁移学习方法。具体而言，我们通过将工作按其贡献和解决的挑战进行分类和呈现，以提供问题-解决方案的视角。",
