    "abstract": "Purpose: Wood comprises different cell types, such as fibers and vessels, defining its properties. Studying their shape, size, and arrangement in microscopic images is crucial for understanding wood samples. Typically, this involves macerating (soaking) samples in a solution to separate cells, then spreading them on slides for imaging with a microscope that covers a wide area, capturing thousands of cells.

Results: In this work, we develop an automatic deep learning segmentation approach that utilizes the one-stage YOLOv8 model for fast and accurate fiber and vessel segmentation and characterization in microscopy images.

    "translated_abstract": "目的：木材由纤维和导管等不同种类的细胞组成，这些细胞的形状、大小和排列对于理解木材样本至关重要。通常，这涉及将样本浸泡在溶液中以分离细胞，然后将它们分散在载玻片上，用显微镜进行广域成像，捕捉数千个细胞。然而，这些细胞在图像中经常聚集和重叠，使用标准图像处理方法进行分割变得困难且耗时。结果：在这项工作中，我们开发了一种自动深度学习分割方法，利用一阶YOLOv8模型来快速而准确地对显微镜图像中的纤维和导管进行分割和特征提取。该模型可以分析32640 x 25920像素的图像，并展示出有效的细胞检测和分割，达到78%的mAP_0.5-0.95。为了评估模型的鲁棒性，我们对经过基因改造的纤维进行了研究。",
