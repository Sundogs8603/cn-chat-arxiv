    "abstract": "We propose an approach for curating multimodal data that we used for our entry in the 2023 DataComp competition filtering track. Our technique combines object detection and weak supervision-based ensembling. In the first of two steps in our approach, we employ an out-of-the-box zero-shot object detection model to extract granular information and produce a variety of filter designs. In the second step, we employ weak supervision to ensemble filtering rules. This approach results in a 4% performance improvement when compared to the best-performing baseline, producing the top-ranking position in the small scale track at the time of writing. Furthermore, in the medium scale track, we achieve a noteworthy 4.2% improvement over the baseline by simply ensembling existing baselines with weak supervision.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种用于整理多模态数据的方法，该方法用于2023年DataComp竞赛的过滤器任务。我们的技术结合了目标检测和基于弱监督的集成学习。在我们的方法的第一步中，我们使用一个开箱即用的零样本目标检测模型提取细粒度信息并生成各种过滤器设计。在第二步中，我们使用弱监督来集成过滤规则。这种方法相对于最佳基准的性能提高了4％，在撰写本文时在小规模轨道上排名第一。此外，在中等规模轨道上，我们通过简单地使用现有基线和弱监督进行集成，实现了相对于基线的显着4.2％的改进。",
