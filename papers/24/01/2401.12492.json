Group attributes are technically easier but coarse: not all 45-year-olds write the same way. In contrast, modeling individuals captures the complexity of each person's identity.

We compare modeling human context via group attributes, individual users, and combined approaches.

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理在将人的上下文纳入其模型中取得了进展，但使用群体属性（如45岁以上的人群）还是模拟个体人物更有效的问题尚未确定。群体属性在技术上更容易实现，但是过于粗糙：并非所有45岁以上的人都以相同的方式书写。相反，模拟个体人物能够捕捉每个人身份的复杂性，允许更个性化的表示，但我们可能需要模拟无限数量的用户并且需要可能无法获取的数据。我们比较了通过群体属性、个体用户和组合方法来模拟人的上下文。将群体和个体特征结合起来，显著提高了基于用户文档的用户级回归任务（如年龄估计或个性评估）的性能。模拟个体用户显著提高了单个文档级分类任务（如立场和主题检测）的性能。",
