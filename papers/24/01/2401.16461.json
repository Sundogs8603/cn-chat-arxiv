    "translated_abstract": "多智能体系统可视为一个自主智能体的社会，通过社会规范可以有效地调控智能体的交互。一般来说，一个社会的规范并不是硬编码的，而是从智能体的交互中产生的。具体来说，一个社会中的智能体对另一个智能体的行为作出的反应以及对他人反应的回应，决定了社会中出现哪些规范。我们将一个智能体对另一个智能体的满意或不满意行为的反应视为第一个智能体向第二个智能体的交流。理解这些交流是一种社会智能：这些交流通过推动智能体朝着某些行为进行，从而促进规范的出现。虽然众所周知惩罚可以导致规范的出现，但我们认为更宽泛的社会智能可能在促进多智能体系统中的合作方面更有效。因此，我们开发了一种被称为Ne的方法",
