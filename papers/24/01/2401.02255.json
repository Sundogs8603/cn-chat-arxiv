    "translated_abstract": "基于可穿戴设备的人类活动识别（Human Activity Recognition，HAR）是人机交互机器学习中的一个关键任务，因为它能够对人类行为进行基本的理解。由于人类行为的动态性，连续学习可以为HAR系统提供符合用户需求的定制化功能。然而，由于使用可穿戴传感器收集标记数据的困难性，现有的着重于有监督连续学习的方法应用范围有限，而无监督连续学习方法仅处理表征学习，并将分类器训练推迟到稍后的阶段。本研究探索了将连续自监督学习模型CaSSLe和半监督连续学习模型Kaizen应用于基于可穿戴设备的HAR任务，并对其进行自适应改进。这些方案重新利用对比学习来保留知识，并且Kaizen将其与自训练相结合，形成一个统一的方案，可以同时进行表征学习和下游分类。",
