    "translated_abstract": "训练有效的机器学习 (ML) 模型是一个需要在多个维度上付出努力的迭代过程。纵向上，一个单一的管道通常包括原始数据集的初始ETL（提取、变换、加载），模型训练阶段以及从中获取模型性能统计的评估阶段。横向上，在模型配置的搜索空间中可能需要多个这样的管道来找到最佳模型。许多从业者常常手动维护日志并编写简单的粘合代码以自动化工作流程。然而，在云端进行这个过程并不是一件简单的任务，它涉及资源供应、数据管理以及作业历史记录的记录，以确保结果可重现。我们提出了一个端到端的基于云端的机器学习平台，加速云端人工智能（ACAI），以帮助提高机器学习从业者的生产力。ACAI通过实现基于云端的存储和索引的应用，支持模型管理，简化了这个过程。",
