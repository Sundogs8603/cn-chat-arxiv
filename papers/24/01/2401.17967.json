    "translated_abstract": "深度学习被广泛应用于挖掘大型代码库中的隐藏模式。为了实现这一目标，构建一个能够捕捉源代码的相关特征和特性的格式至关重要。基于图形的表示因其能够模拟结构和语义信息而受到关注。然而，现有工具在跨不同编程语言构建图形方面缺乏灵活性，限制了它们的使用。此外，这些工具的输出通常缺乏互操作性，并导致图形神经网络训练速度较慢且不可扩展。我们引入了CONCORD，一个用于构建可定制图形表示的领域特定语言。它实现了减少图形大小复杂性的启发式方法。我们通过代码异味检测作为一个示例用例展示了其有效性，并显示：首先，CONCORD可以根据指定的配置自动产生代码表示；其次，我们的方法可以通过减少图形复杂性来提高图形神经网络的训练速度和可扩展性。",
