    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络在许多机器学习任务中取得了进展，但在现实世界的数据中，噪声标签常常影响其性能。为解决这个问题，我们引入了CoLafier，一种利用局部内在维度（LID）进行带有噪声标签学习的新方法。CoLafier由两个子网络组成：LID-dis和LID-gen。LID-dis是专门的分类器，使用我们独特的方案进行训练，它同时使用样本的特征和标签来预测标签，从而产生增强的内部表示。我们观察到，从这个表示计算出来的LID分数能够有效区分不同噪声情况下的正确和错误标签。与LID-dis相反，LID-gen作为常规分类器，仅使用样本的特征。在训练过程中，CoLafier利用每个实例的两个增强视图同时输入两个子网络。CoLafier将来自LID-dis的两个视图的LID分数作为分配标签的考虑因素。",
