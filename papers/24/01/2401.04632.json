The input was four related Stock Market time series, and the prediction of one of them is expected. The optimization of hyperparameters related to the classes of architectures was performed in order to compare the best neural networks within the class. The results show that in most cases, the architecture with a hypercomplex dense layer provides similar MAE accuracy to other architectures, however, with considerably less trainable parameters. Thanks to it, hypercomplex neural networks can be learned and process data faster than the other tested architectures. Moreover, the order of the input time series has an impact on effectively.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文测试了三种用于时间序列预测的架构。它们的区别在于输入层包含卷积层、LSTM层或四元数4D代数的超复数层。输入是四个相关的股票市场时间序列，预测其中一个的结果。通过优化与架构类别相关的超参数，比较了最佳神经网络在类别内的表现。结果显示，在大多数情况下，具有超复数密集层的架构提供了与其他架构相似的MAE准确性，但可训练参数要少得多。由于这一点，超复数神经网络可以比其他测试的架构更快地学习和处理数据。此外，输入时间序列的顺序对有效性有影响。",
