    "translated_abstract": "出域（OOD）检测在确保神经网络安全性方面起着关键作用。现有的研究利用了内域（ID）样本在特征空间中形成一个子空间的事实，并取得了最先进的性能。然而，内域子空间的综合特征仍然未被充分探索。最近，神经崩溃（NC）的发现揭示了内域子空间的新特性。利用NC的洞察力，我们观察到特征与内域特征子空间之间的主角度在衡量出域可能性方面形成了一种优越的表示。基于这一观察，我们提出了一种新颖的NC受启发的出域评分函数，名为增强熵主角度（EPA），它集成了内域子空间的全局特征和其内部属性。我们对EPA和各种最先进的方法进行了实验比较，验证了其卓越的性能和稳健性。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一种名为EPA的出域检测器，其受到神经崩溃的启发。通过观察特征与内域特征子空间之间的主角度，EPA能够更有效地衡量出域样本的可能性，并在实验证明其在性能和稳健性方面超过了其他方法。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a novel out-of-distribution detector called EPA, inspired by neural collapse. By measuring the principal angle between the features and the ID feature subspace, EPA is able to effectively assess the likelihood of out-of-distribution samples and outperforms other methods in terms of performance and robustness."
