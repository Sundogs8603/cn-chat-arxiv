    "translated_abstract": "将内容从一种语言转换为另一种语言的计算机系统被称为机器翻译（MT）。为了确保有效的翻译，保留源语言的上下文和词汇解释，各种技术已经出现。端到端神经机器翻译（NMT）是一种流行的技术，现在被广泛应用于实际的MT系统中。MT系统需要大量的平行数据集（一个语言中的句子与另一门语言的翻译），这些数据集对于MT系统在训练阶段学习语言结构和模式至关重要。其中一种数据集是Samanantar，这是最大的公开可访问的印度语言（ILs）平行数据集。由于该语料库来自各个来源，因此包含了许多错误的翻译。因此，使用该数据集构建的MT系统无法发挥其正常潜力。在本文中，我们提出了一个算法来去除误译。",
