    "translated_abstract": "点云配准是三维计算机视觉中一项关键技术，具有广泛的应用范围。然而，这个任务在具有动态对象、环境噪声或其他扰动的大视角中可能具有挑战性。为了应对这一挑战，我们提出了一种名为PosDiffNet的模型。我们的方法基于窗口级、补丁级和点级对应进行分层配准。我们利用基于Beltrami流的图神经偏微分方程(PDE)获得点云的高维特征和位置嵌入。我们将位置嵌入引入基于神经常微分方程(ODE)的Transformer模块中，以高效表示点内的补丁。我们利用高特征相似性分数导出的多级对应来促进点云之间的对齐。随后，我们使用基于SVD的算法等配准方法来预测变换。",
