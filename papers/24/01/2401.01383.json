    "translated_abstract": "对于识别早期脑连接性发展的动态过程，了解婴儿脑网络在出生后的第一年中的复杂演化至关重要。现有的深度学习解决方案存在三个主要局限性。首先，它们不能泛化到多轨迹预测任务，其中每个图轨迹对应于特定的成像模态或连接类型（例如T1-w MRI）。其次，现有模型需要大量的训练数据集才能达到令人满意的性能，而这往往很难获取。第三，它们不能有效利用不完整的时间序列数据。为了解决这些限制，我们引入了FedGmTE-Net++，一种联邦图形多轨迹演化网络。通过联邦学习的力量，我们在有限的医院数据集中聚合了不同医院的本地学习结果。结果即可提高每个医院本地生成模型的性能，同时保护数据隐私。",
