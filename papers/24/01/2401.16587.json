    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了人类和LLM生成的对话之间的语言差异，使用了由ChatGPT-3.5生成的19.5K个对话作为EmpathicDialogues数据集的补充。研究采用Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) 分析，比较了ChatGPT生成的对话和人类对话在118个语言类别上的差异。结果显示人类对话具有更大的变异性和真实性，但ChatGPT在社交过程、分析风格、认知、关注焦点和积极情绪色彩等方面表现出色，这进一步证明了LLMs“比真人更像真人”的最新发现。然而，在ChatGPT和人类对话之间没有找到积极或消极情绪的显著差异。对话嵌入的分类器分析表明，尽管对话中没有明确提及情绪，但对情感价值的隐性编码存在。研究还提供了一个新颖的、由两个ChatGPT生成的对话组成的数据集。",
