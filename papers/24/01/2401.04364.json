In this paper, we conduct an extensive and comprehensive review and analysis of the latest state-of-the-art deepfake detectors, evaluating them against several critical criteria. These criteria facilitate the categorization of these detectors into 4 high-level groups and 13 fine-grained sub-groups, all aligned with a unified standard conceptual framework. This classification and framework offer deep and practical insights into the factors that affect detector efficacy. We assess the generalizability of 16 leading detectors across various standard attack scenarios, including black-bo",

    "translated_abstract": "深度伪造技术迅速成为对社会构成深远和严重威胁的原因之一，主要由于其易于制作和传播。这种情况加速了深度伪造检测技术的发展。然而，许多现有的检测器在验证时 heavily 依赖实验室生成的数据集，这可能无法有效地让它们应对新颖、新兴和实际的深度伪造技术。本文对最新的深度伪造检测器进行广泛全面的回顾和分析，根据几个关键标准对它们进行评估。这些标准将这些检测器分为 4 个高级组别和 13 个细粒度子组别，都遵循一个统一的标准概念框架。这种分类和框架提供了对影响检测器功效的因素的深入和实用的见解。我们对 16 个主要的检测器在各种标准的攻击场景中的普适性进行评估，包括黑盒攻击场景。",
