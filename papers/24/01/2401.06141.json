In this article, we consider an Omega risk process with deterministic growth and a multiplicative jump (collapse) structure to model the capital of a household. It is assumed that, when a household's capital level is above a certain capital barrier level that determines a household's eligibility for a capital cash transfer programme, its capital grows exponentially.

    "translated_abstract": "困境指的是家庭陷入贫困区域的情况。生活在贫困区域或陷入贫困区域的家庭被称为贫困陷阱的家庭，贫困陷阱是一种在没有外部帮助的情况下难以逃脱的贫困状态。同样，极端贫困被认为是最严重的贫困形式，家庭在其中经历严重的基本人类需求不足。在本文中，我们考虑了一个具有确定性增长和乘性跳跃（崩溃）结构的Omega风险过程来模拟家庭的资本。假设当一个家庭的资本水平高于确定资本壁垒水平时，确定家庭是否有资格参加现金资本转移方案，其资本会指数增长。一旦其资本降至资本壁垒水平以下，资本动态会引入直接转移（资本现金转移）的外部支持，这些支持由捐助者或政府提供。否则",
    "tldr": "本文研究了直接资本现金转移对于贫困和极端贫困的减轻作用。通过模拟家庭资本的Omega风险过程，发现在资本水平低于一定水平时，外部支持以直接转移形式提供，以帮助家庭摆脱贫困陷阱。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the role of direct capital cash transfers in alleviating poverty and extreme poverty. By modeling the capital of households using an Omega risk process, it is found that external support in the form of direct transfers is provided when the capital level falls below a certain threshold, helping households escape poverty traps."
