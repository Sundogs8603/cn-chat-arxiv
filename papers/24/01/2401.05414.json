    "abstract": "Financial data is generally time series in essence and thus suffers from three fundamental issues: the mismatch in time resolution, the time-varying property of the distribution - nonstationarity, and causal factors that are important but unknown/unobserved. In this paper, we follow a causal perspective to systematically look into these three demons in finance. Specifically, we reexamine these issues in the context of causality, which gives rise to a novel and inspiring understanding of how the issues can be addressed. Following this perspective, we provide systematic solutions to these problems, which hopefully would serve as a foundation for future research in the area.",

    "translated_abstract": "金融数据本质上是时间序列数据，因此存在三个基本问题：时间分辨率不匹配、分布的时变性-非平稳性以及重要但未知/未观测的因果因素。在本文中，我们从因果性的角度系统地研究金融中的这三个困境。具体而言，我们重新审视了这些问题，并在因果性的背景下提出了新颖而有启发性的解决方案，为未来研究提供一个基础。",
