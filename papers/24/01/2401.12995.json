    "abstract": "Code-mixing, the blending of multiple languages within a single conversation, introduces a distinctive challenge, particularly in the context of response generation. Capturing the intricacies of code-mixing proves to be a formidable task, given the wide-ranging variations influenced by individual speaking styles and cultural backgrounds. In this study, we explore response generation within code-mixed conversations. We introduce a novel approach centered on harnessing the Big Five personality traits acquired in an unsupervised manner from the conversations to bolster the performance of response generation. These inferred personality attributes are seamlessly woven into the fabric of the dialogue context, using a novel fusion mechanism, PA3. It uses an effective two-step attention formulation to fuse the dialogue and personality information. This fusion not only enhances the contextual relevance of generated responses but also elevates the overall performance of the model. Our experiment",

    "translated_abstract": "代码混合是在一个对话中混合多种语言的现象，特别是在回应生成的上下文中，引入了独特的挑战。捕捉代码混合的复杂性被证明是一项艰巨的任务，因为个体的说话风格和文化背景会产生各种各样的变异。在本研究中，我们探索了代码混合对话中的回应生成。我们介绍了一种新颖的方法，重点是利用从对话中以无监督方式获取的五大人格特质来增强回应生成的性能。这些推断出来的人格属性被无缝地编织到对话上下文中，使用一种新颖的融合机制PA3。它使用一种有效的两步注意力公式来融合对话和个性信息。这种融合不仅增强了生成回应的上下文相关性，还提高了模型的整体性能。",
