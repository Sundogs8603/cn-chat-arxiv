    "abstract": "The problem of traffic congestion not only causes a large amount of economic losses, but also seriously endangers the urban environment. Predicting traffic congestion has important practical significance. So far, most studies have been based on historical data from sensors placed on different roads to predict future traffic flow and speed, to analyze the traffic congestion conditions of a certain road segment. However, due to the fixed position of sensors, it is difficult to mine new information. On the other hand, vehicle trajectory data is more flexible and can extract traffic information as needed. Therefore, we proposed a new traffic congestion prediction model - Multi Adjacency relationship Attention Graph Convolutional Networks(MA2GCN). This model transformed vehicle trajectory data into graph structured data in grid form, and proposed a vehicle entry and exit matrix based on the mobility between different grids. At the same time, in order to improve the performance of the model,",

    "translated_abstract": "交通拥堵问题不仅导致巨大的经济损失，而且严重危害城市环境。预测交通拥堵具有重要的实际意义。迄今为止，大多数研究都是基于不同路段上的传感器的历史数据来预测未来的交通流量和速度，分析某个道路段的交通拥堵情况。然而，由于传感器的固定位置，很难挖掘新的信息。另一方面，车辆轨迹数据更加灵活，可以根据需要提取交通信息。因此，我们提出了一种新的交通拥堵预测模型——多邻接关系注意力图卷积网络（MA2GCN）。该模型将车辆轨迹数据转化为网格形式的图结构化数据，并基于不同网格之间的流动性提出了车辆进出矩阵。同时，为了提高模型的性能，",
