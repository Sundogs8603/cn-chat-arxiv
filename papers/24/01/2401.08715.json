    "translated_abstract": "鉴于金属增材制造中数据不足的问题，已经采用迁移学习（TL）从源领域（例如完成的打印）中提取知识，以改善目标领域（例如新的打印）中的建模性能。当前的应用程序直接在迁移学习中使用所有可访问的源数据，而不考虑源数据和目标数据之间的相似性。本文提出了一种系统的方法，基于源数据和目标数据集之间的相似性来寻找适当的源数据子集，针对一组有限的目标领域数据。这种相似性通过空间和模型距离度量来刻画。基于Pareto frontier的源数据选择方法被开发出来，通过两个相似度距离度量定义的Pareto frontier上的源数据被迭代选择。该方法被集成到基于实例的TL方法（决策树回归模型）和基于模型的TL方法（微调的人工神经网络）中。",
