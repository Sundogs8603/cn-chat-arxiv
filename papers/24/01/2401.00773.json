    "translated_abstract": "概率混合模型被认为是一种有价值的工具，用于无监督异常检测，因为它们具有解释性，并且在统计原理上有直观基础。在这个框架内，Dirichlet过程混合模型作为传统有限混合模型在聚类和异常检测任务中的一个引人注目的替代选择。然而，尽管它们明显具有优势，但在无监督异常检测中广泛采用Dirichlet过程混合模型受到与构建检测器过程中的计算效率和对异常值的敏感性有关的挑战的阻碍。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种基于Dirichlet过程高斯混合模型集合的新型异常检测方法。所提出的方法是一种完全无监督的算法，利用了随机子空间和子抽样集合，不仅确保了高效计算，还增强了结果异常检测器的鲁棒性。",
