    "translated_abstract": "自动食谱生成方法为厨师提供了一种创造性工具，可以探索和创造新的有趣的烹饪美食。考虑到大型语言模型（LLMs）的最近成功，它们有潜力创造出可以满足个人偏好、膳食限制以及适应您冰箱内食材的新食谱。现有的通过LLMs生成食谱的研究表明，LLMs可以通过微调来生成听起来真实的食谱。然而，仔细检查后发现，这些生成的食谱往往无法满足基本要求，比如在鸡肉菜肴中包含鸡肉。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为RecipeMC的文本生成方法，它使用GPT-2并依赖于蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）。RecipeMC允许我们定义奖励函数以对文本生成进行软限制，从而提高生成食谱的可信度。我们的结果表明，人类评估者更喜欢使用RecipeMC生成的食谱。",
