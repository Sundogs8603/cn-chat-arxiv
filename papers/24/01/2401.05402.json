    "translated_abstract": "在材料科学中，发现具有特定化学性质的晶体结构已成为越来越重要的研究焦点。然而，当前的模型在生成新的晶体晶格方面存在局限性，因为它们只考虑原子位置或化学组成。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一种概率扩散模型，利用几何等变GNN同时考虑原子位置和晶体晶格。为评估我们模型的有效性，我们引入了一个受Frechet Inception Distance启发的新的生成指标，但基于GNN能量预测，而不是计算机视觉中使用的InceptionV3。除了常用的评估指标（如有效性，评估结构的合理性）外，这种新指标提供了对我们模型能力更全面的评估。我们在现有基准上的实验证明了我们扩散模型的重要性。我们还展示了我们的方法能够有效地学习有意义的表示。",
