    "translated_abstract": "聚类联邦多任务学习（CFL）已经引起了相当大的关注，作为一种有效的克服统计挑战的策略，特别是在处理多用户之间存在非独立同分布（non IID）数据时。然而，现有的CFL研究大多基于一个不切实际的假设，即设备可以访问准确的真实标签。这个假设在分层无线网络（HWNs）中尤为有问题，其中边缘网络包含大量未标记的数据，导致收敛速度较慢和处理时间增加，特别是在两层模型聚合时。为了解决这些问题，我们引入了一种新颖的框架，聚类联邦半监督学习（CFSL），用于更真实的HWN场景。我们的方法利用了一种表现最佳的专门模型算法，其中每个设备被分配一个专门的模型，该模型在生成准确标签方面非常熟练。",
