    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体广告对于品牌营销至关重要，致力于吸引消费者的注意力，通过吸引人的标题、图片以及标志来实现。尽管先前的研究侧重于为一般图像生成标题，但将品牌个性融入社交媒体标题仍未得到探索。品牌个性已被证明对消费者行为和社交互动产生影响，因此是营销策略的关键要素。现有的开源多模态语言模型并不适用于此任务。因此，我们提出了一种流程解决方案，以帮助品牌创建与图像和品牌个性相一致的吸引人社交媒体标题。我们的架构包含两个部分：第一部分包含一个图像字幕模型，它接收品牌要在网上发布的图像并生成一个简洁的英文标题；第二部分接收生成的标题以及目标品牌个性，输出与品牌个性相一致且引人注目的社交媒体标题。",
