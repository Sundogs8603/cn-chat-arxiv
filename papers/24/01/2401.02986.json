    "abstract": "Organizations face the challenge of ensuring compliance with an increasing amount of requirements from various regulatory documents. Which requirements are relevant depends on aspects such as the geographic location of the organization, its domain, size, and business processes. Considering these contextual factors, as a first step, relevant documents (e.g., laws, regulations, directives, policies) are identified, followed by a more detailed analysis of which parts of the identified documents are relevant for which step of a given business process. Nowadays the identification of regulatory requirements relevant to business processes is mostly done manually by domain and legal experts, posing a tremendous effort on them, especially for a large number of regulatory documents which might frequently change.

    "translated_abstract": "组织面临着确保遵守各种监管文件中越来越多要求的挑战。哪些要求是相关的取决于如组织的地理位置、领域、规模和业务流程等方面的因素。考虑到这些情境因素，首先需要识别相关文件（例如法律、规则、指令、政策），然后详细分析识别文件的哪些部分与给定业务流程的哪个步骤相关。目前，识别与业务流程相关的监管要求主要由领域和法律专家手动完成，对他们来说是一项巨大的工作量，特别是对于可能经常变化的大量监管文件。因此，本研究探讨了如何辅助法律和领域专家评估相关要求。为此，我们比较了基于嵌入的自然语言处理排序方法，生成AI模型及众包和专家驱动方法。",
