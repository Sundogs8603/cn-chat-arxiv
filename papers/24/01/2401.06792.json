    "abstract": "With the development of artificial intelligence, large-scale models have become increasingly intelligent. However, numerous studies indicate that hallucinations within these large models are a bottleneck hindering the development of AI research. In the pursuit of achieving strong artificial intelligence, a significant volume of research effort is being invested in the AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) hallucination research. Previous explorations have been conducted in researching hallucinations within LLMs (Large Language Models). As for multimodal AGI, research on hallucinations is still in an early stage. To further the progress of research in the domain of hallucinatory phenomena, we present a bird's eye view of hallucinations in AGI, summarizing the current work on AGI hallucinations and proposing some directions for future research.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能的发展，大规模模型变得越来越智能。然而，许多研究表明，这些大模型中的幻觉成为了阻碍AI研究发展的瓶颈。为了实现强人工智能，大量的研究工作正在投入到AGI（人工通用智能）幻觉研究中。以往的探索主要集中在研究LLM（大语言模型）中的幻觉，而对于多模态AGI，幻觉研究仍处于早期阶段。为了进一步推动幻觉现象领域的研究进展，我们提供了对AGI幻觉的总览，总结了当前对AGI幻觉的研究工作，并提出了一些未来研究方向的建议。",
