    "translated_abstract": "在解决带有时间窗口的车辆路径问题时，我们经常需要将车辆计划连接成跨越更长时间区间的序列，换句话说，我们需要执行计划链路。最近，提出了一种基于网络的方法来解决车队规模问题。然而，该方法不考虑计划的时间灵活性，这是所有带有时间窗口的车辆路径问题的重要属性。相反，计划具有固定时间，不能延迟。本文提出了一种新的问题建模，考虑了延迟和给定时间窗口，并提出了一种解决该问题的方法。此外，我们证明了该方法是最优的，并对其复杂性进行了分析。最后，我们列举了一些实际应用，并对其中一个应用进行了演示：静态拨打车问题的解决方法。演示结果显示，在大量实例中，所提出的方法提供了更好的解决方案。",
