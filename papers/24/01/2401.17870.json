    "translated_abstract": "次季节预报对农业、水资源管理和灾害预警至关重要，但由于大气的混沌性，面临着挑战。最近机器学习领域的进展通过实现与数值模型相当的预测能力，革新了天气预报。然而，训练这些基础模型需要数千个GPU的计算时间，这导致相当多的碳排放，并限制了其更广泛的应用。此外，机器学习模型往往通过产生平滑的结果来愚弄像素误差评分，这些结果缺乏物理一致性和气象意义。为了解决上述问题，我们提出了一种远程连接通知的Transformer。我们的架构利用预训练的Pangu模型来获得良好的初始权重，并集成了一个远程连接通知的时间模块，以提高在延长的时间范围内的可预测性。值得注意的是，通过调整Pangu模型的1.1%参数，我们的方法改进了预测能力。",
