    "translated_abstract": "尽管图像和文本在机器学习中的应用越来越多，但表格数据仍然在各个领域中普遍存在。深度学习模型如卷积神经网络和transformers在处理表格数据上取得了很好的性能，但它们需要大量的数据预处理、调优和资源，限制了其可访问性和可扩展性。本研究基于结构化状态空间模型（SSM）开发了一种创新的方法，称为MambaTab，用于处理表格数据。SSM对于从具有长程依赖的数据中高效提取有效表示具有很强的能力。MambaTab利用了Mamba，一种新兴的SSM变体，在表格上进行端到端的有监督学习。与最先进的基线模型相比，MambaTab在多样化的基准数据集上经验验证，表现出卓越的性能，并且需要更少的参数和较少的预处理步骤。MambaTab的效率、可扩展性、普适性和预测性能使其成为一种轻量级的、即开即用的方法。",
