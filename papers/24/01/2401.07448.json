    "translated_abstract": "近期对联邦学习（FL）的不断研究进展极大地促进了分布式协作应用的发展，特别是在物联网人工智能（AIoT）领域。然而，当前研究领域中一个缺失的关键方面是使具有符号推理能力的数据驱动客户模型能够工作。具体而言，参与联邦学习的客户设备的异质性构成了一个重要挑战，因为每个客户都具有独特的逻辑推理特性。忽视这些设备特定的规范可能会导致客户端预测中遗漏关键属性，从而导致性能不佳。在本研究中，我们提出了一种新的训练范式，利用时态逻辑推理来解决这个问题。我们的方法涉及通过为每个FL客户端加入机械生成的逻辑表达式来增强训练过程。此外，我们引入了聚合群集的概念。",
