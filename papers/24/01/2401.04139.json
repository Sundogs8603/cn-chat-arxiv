    "translated_abstract": "本研究介绍了CCNETS（具有因果合作网络的因果学习），这是一种新颖的基于生成模型的分类器，旨在解决模式识别中不平衡数据集生成的挑战。CCNETS独特地设计成模拟类似于大脑的信息处理，并包括三个主要组件：解释器、生成器和推理器。每个组件都被设计成模仿特定的大脑功能，有助于生成高质量的数据集并增强分类性能。该模型特别关注在机器学习中处理不平衡数据集的常见和重要挑战。通过将CCNETS应用于一个“欺诈数据集”，其中正常交易明显多于欺诈交易（99.83％ vs. 0.17％），证明了CCNETS的有效性。传统方法往往在处理这种不平衡时遇到困难，导致性能指标不均衡。然而，CCNETS展现出优越的分类能力，通过其性能指标的改善来体现。",
