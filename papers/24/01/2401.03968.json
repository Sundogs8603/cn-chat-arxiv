    "translated_abstract": "单细胞RNA测序（scRNA-seq）数据对于研究单细胞水平生命规律至关重要。然而，获取足够高质量的scRNA-seq数据仍然具有挑战性。为了缓解数据受限的问题，已经提出了生成模型来计算生成合成scRNA-seq数据。然而，目前模型生成的数据尚不够真实，特别是在需要生成受控条件数据时。与此同时，扩散模型展示了其在高保真度生成数据方面的能力，为scRNA-seq生成提供了新机会。在这项研究中，我们开发了scDiffusion，这是一个将扩散模型和基础模型相结合的生成模型，可以以受控条件生成高质量的scRNA-seq数据。我们设计了多个分类器来同时指导扩散过程，使scDiffusion能够在多个条件下生成数据。",
