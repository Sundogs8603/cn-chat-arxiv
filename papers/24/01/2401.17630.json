    "abstract": "Federated recommender systems (FedRecs) have gained significant attention for their potential to protect user's privacy by keeping user privacy data locally and only communicating model parameters/gradients to the server. Nevertheless, the currently existing architecture of FedRecs assumes that all users have the same 0-privacy budget, i.e., they do not upload any data to the server, thus overlooking those users who are less concerned about privacy and are willing to upload data to get a better recommendation service. To bridge this gap, this paper explores a user-governed data contribution federated recommendation architecture where users are free to take control of whether they share data and the proportion of data they share to the server. To this end, this paper presents a cloud-device collaborative graph neural network federated recommendation model, named CDCGNNFed.

    "translated_abstract": "联邦推荐系统（FedRecs）由于将用户隐私数据保留在本地并只向服务器传递模型参数/梯度的潜力，已经引起了重要的关注。然而，现有的FedRecs架构假设所有用户具有相同的零隐私预算，即他们不会上传任何数据到服务器，因此忽略了那些不太关心隐私并愿意上传数据获得更好推荐服务的用户。为了弥补这一差距，本文探索了一种用户控制的数据贡献联邦推荐架构，用户可以自由决定是否共享数据以及共享给服务器的数据比例。为此，本文提出了一种名为CDCGNNFed的云设备协作图神经网络联邦推荐模型，它在本地训练基于用户中心的个人图，并在服务器上基于用户共享数据训练高阶图。",
