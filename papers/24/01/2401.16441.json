    "translated_abstract": "在过去的几年中，基于深度学习的大量虚假新闻检测算法应运而生。然而，它们往往在不同的框架下开发，每个框架又要求使用不同的方法，因此阻碍了可重复性。此外，这些虚假新闻检测模型的代码开发中存在大量的冗余。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了FaKnow，一个统一且全面的虚假新闻检测算法库。它涵盖了多种常用的虚假新闻检测模型，包括基于内容和基于社会环境的方法。该库涵盖了模型训练和评估流程的完整范围，在一个统一框架内有效组织了数据、模型和训练程序。此外，它还提供了一系列辅助功能和工具，包括可视化和日志记录。我们的工作为虚假新闻检测的标准化和统一化做出了贡献。",
