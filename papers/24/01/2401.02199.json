    "translated_abstract": "随着自动驾驶系统（ADS）的演进，智能交通的视野不断扩大，确保极其安全变得比以往任何时候都更为迫切。传统的风险评估方法主要用于人工驾驶的车辆，无法充分适应ADS多方面、不断演变的环境。本文引入了一种基于人工神经网络（ANN）的实时动态风险评估（DRA）框架。我们提出的解决方案突破了这些限制，利用深度学习的核心部分——ANN，通过分析和分类实时的车载传感器（OBS）数据来细致地分析和分类风险维度。这种以学习为中心的方法不仅提升了ADS的情境意识，还丰富了其对即时运行环境的理解。通过分析OBS数据，系统能够准确定位其当前的风险配置文件，从而提高了乘客和更广泛旅途中的安全前景。",
