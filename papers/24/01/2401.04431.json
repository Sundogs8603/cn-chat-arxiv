    "translated_abstract": "海浪监测在海洋学的许多应用中至关重要，如天气和波浪模型的验证。传统的现场解决方案基于锚定浮标，其测量通常被视为标准。然而，由于暴露在恶劣环境中，它们不可靠，需要频繁维护，并且数据集存在许多间断。为了克服以前的限制，我们提出了一个系统，其中包括一个浮标，一个微地震测量站和一个机器学习算法。工作原理基于测量海浪产生的微地震信号。因此，机器学习算法将被训练以从微地震数据重建缺失的浮标数据。由于微地震站可以安装在室内，它保证了高可靠性，而机器学习算法提供了准确重建缺失的浮标数据。在这项工作中，我们介绍了处理数据的方法，开发和训练机器学习算法的方法。",
