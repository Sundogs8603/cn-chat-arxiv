    "translated_abstract": "学习大规模代理群体的行为是许多研究领域中的重要任务。虽然多代理强化学习（MARL）领域在解决这些系统方面取得了重要进展，但对于许多代理的解决方案通常在计算上是不可行的，且缺乏理论保证。平均场对局博弈（MFGs）解决了这两个问题，并且可以扩展到包括代理之间的网络结构的图形平均场对局博弈（GMFGs）。尽管具有诸多优点，但GMFGs的现实世界应用受到图形只能捕捉密集图的限制。由于大多数实验证明的网络显示出一定程度的稀疏性，例如幂律图，因此GMFG框架无法捕捉这些网络拓扑结构。因此，我们提出了一种新颖的图形对局博弈（GXMFGs）的概念，它建立在图论概念图形扩展（graphexes）基础上。图形扩展是稀疏图序列的极限对象，还具有其他一些理想特性，如sma",
