    "abstract": "This study compared the classification performance of Gemini Pro and GPT-4V in educational settings. Employing visual question answering (VQA) techniques, the study examined both models' abilities to read text-based rubrics and then automatically score student-drawn models in science education. We employed both quantitative and qualitative analyses using a dataset derived from student-drawn scientific models and employing NERIF (Notation-Enhanced Rubrics for Image Feedback) prompting methods. The findings reveal that GPT-4V significantly outperforms Gemini Pro in terms of scoring accuracy and Quadratic Weighted Kappa. The qualitative analysis reveals that the differences may be due to the models' ability to process fine-grained texts in images and overall image classification performance. Even adapting the NERIF approach by further de-sizing the input images, Gemini Pro seems not able to perform as well as GPT-4V. The findings suggest GPT-4V's superior capability in handling complex mu",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究在教育环境中比较了Gemini Pro和GPT-4V在分类性能上的表现。通过使用视觉问答（VQA）技术，本研究考察了两个模型在阅读基于文本的评分标准并自动评分科学教育中学生绘制的模型的能力。我们采用了定量和定性分析，并使用了从学生绘制的科学模型中得出的数据集以及NERIF（Notation-Enhanced Rubrics for Image Feedback）提问方法。研究结果显示，GPT-4V在评分准确度和Quadratic Weighted Kappa方面明显优于Gemini Pro。定性分析显示，这种差异可能源于模型在图像中处理细致文本和整体图像分类性能方面的能力。即使通过进一步缩小输入图像的NERIF方法来适应Gemini Pro，其性能仍不如GPT-4V。研究结果表明GPT-4V在处理复杂多样的学生绘制模型方面具有更强的能力。",
