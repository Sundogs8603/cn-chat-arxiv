    "abstract": "In-context learning, a paradigm bridging the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, has demonstrated high efficacy in several NLP tasks, especially in few-shot settings. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods, in-context learning adapts pre-trained models to unseen tasks without updating any parameters. Despite being widely applied, in-context learning is vulnerable to malicious attacks. In this work, we raise security concerns regarding this paradigm. Our studies demonstrate that an attacker can manipulate the behavior of large language models by poisoning the demonstration context, without the need for fine-tuning the model. Specifically, we have designed a new backdoor attack method, named ICLAttack, to target large language models based on in-context learning. Our method encompasses two types of attacks: poisoning demonstration examples and poisoning prompts, which can make models behave in accordance with predefined intentions. ICLAttack does not require additional fine-tuning ",

    "translated_abstract": "上下文学习是一种在预训练和微调之间弥合差距的范式，在几个自然语言处理任务中展现了高效性，特别是在少样本设置中。与传统的微调方法不同，上下文学习能够适应未见过的任务而无需更新任何参数。尽管被广泛应用，上下文学习仍然容易受到恶意攻击。本研究提出了对这一范式的安全性问题的关切。我们的研究表明，攻击者可以通过污染示范上下文来操控大型语言模型的行为，而无需对模型进行微调。具体来说，我们设计了一种新的后门攻击方法，命名为ICLAttack，针对基于上下文学习的大型语言模型。我们的方法包括两种类型的攻击：污染示范样本和污染提示，可以使模型按照预定义的意图行事。ICLAttack不需要额外的微调。",
