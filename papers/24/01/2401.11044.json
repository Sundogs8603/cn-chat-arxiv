    "translated_abstract": "广泛采用的机器学习(ML)方法在分类方面的适用性受到了解释能力和不确定性的限制，特别是在医疗保健、行为科学和金融等领域，其中责任问题至关重要。最近，提出了Small and Incomplete Dataset Analyser (SaNDA)，通过使用基于ROC曲线的方法开发数据抽象协议，以增强在这些领域中执行分类的能力。本文关注于列间数据转换，即抽象，这对SaNDA的分类过程非常关键，并探讨了替代的抽象协议，如常量分箱和分位数。将最佳的方法与可解释方法的基准模型随机森林进行了比较。结果表明，即使数据不完整，SaNDA在缺少值很少的情况下仍然可以成为随机森林的可行替代品，并且始终保持高准确性。",
