    "translated_abstract": "广义类别发现（GCD）旨在利用已标记的已知类别集的先验知识，推断出未标记数据集中的已知和未知类别。现有研究隐含地或明确地假设未标记数据中每个类别（已知或未知）的出现频率大致相同。然而，在实际应用中，根据视觉类别的长尾特性，我们更有可能遇到已知/常见类别而不是未知/不常见类别。因此，我们提出了一个具有挑战性且实用的问题，即不平衡的广义类别发现（ImbaGCD），其中未标记数据的分布不平衡，已知类别比未知类别更频繁。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了ImbaGCD，一种基于最优传输的期望极大化框架，通过对齐边缘类别先验分布来实现广义类别发现。ImbaGCD还包括一个系统机制来估计未知类别的对齐后验分布。",
