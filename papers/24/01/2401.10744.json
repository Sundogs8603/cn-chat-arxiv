    "abstract": "Large Language models (LLMs) usually rely on extensive training datasets. In the financial domain, creating numerical reasoning datasets that include a mix of tables and long text often involves substantial manual annotation expenses. To address the limited data resources and reduce the annotation cost, we introduce FinLLMs, a method for generating financial question-answering data based on common financial formulas using Large Language Models. First, we compile a list of common financial formulas and construct a graph based on the variables these formulas employ. We then augment the formula set by combining those that share identical variables as new elements. Specifically, we explore formulas obtained by manual annotation and merge those formulas with shared variables by traversing the constructed graph. Finally, utilizing GPT-3.5, we generate financial question-answering data that encompasses both tabular information and long textual content, building on the collected formula set. O",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）通常依赖于大量的训练数据集。在金融领域，创建包含表格和长文本混合的数值推理数据集通常需要大量的手工注释开销。为了解决有限的数据资源并降低注释成本，我们引入了FinLLMs，一种基于常见金融公式使用大型语言模型生成金融问答数据的方法。首先，我们编制了一个常见金融公式列表，并根据这些公式使用的变量构建了一个图形。然后，我们通过合并具有相同变量的公式作为新元素来扩充公式集合。具体来说，我们通过遍历构建的图形，探索通过手工注释获得的公式，并合并具有共享变量的公式。最后，利用GPT-3.5，我们生成了包含表格信息和长文本内容的金融问答数据，借助已收集的公式集合。",
