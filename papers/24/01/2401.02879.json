While quantum kernel alignment is a promising technique, it has been hampered by considerable training costs because the full kernel matrix must be constructed at every training iteration.

    "translated_abstract": "量子机器学习中用于分类问题的量子核对齐是一个不断发展的研究领域。最近，提出了一种参数化核函数的量子核对齐技术，可以对核函数进行训练，从而与特定数据集对齐。尽管量子核对齐是一种有前景的技术，但由于每次训练迭代都必须构建完整的核矩阵，因此一直受到显著的训练成本限制。为了解决这个挑战，我们引入了一种旨在平衡效率和性能的新方法。我们提出了一种子采样训练方法，每次训练步骤使用核矩阵的子集，从而减少了训练的总体计算成本。在这项工作中，我们将子采样方法应用于合成数据集和真实的乳腺癌数据集，并展示在维持分类准确度的同时，所需训练量子核的电路数量大大减少。",
