    "translated_abstract": "在人工智能公平性评估中，分解式评估是一项核心任务，目标是衡量人工智能系统在由人口统计学或其他敏感属性组合定义的不同子群体中的性能。标准方法是将评估数据分层到子群体中，并分别计算每个组的性能指标。然而，即使对于中等规模的评估数据集来说，在考虑到交叉子群体时样本数量也会迅速变小，这大大限制了许多分解评估中对交叉群体的考虑程度。在本研究中，我们引入了一种结构回归方法来进行分解评估，我们证明即使对于非常小的子群体，该方法也能产生可靠的系统性能估计。我们还提供了相应的推断策略来构建置信区间，并探索了拟合优度测试如何揭示交叉子群体所经历的与公平相关的伤害的结构。",
