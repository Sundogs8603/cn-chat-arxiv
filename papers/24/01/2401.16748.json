    "abstract": "Racism is an alarming phenomenon in our country as well as all over the world. Every day we have come across some racist comments in our daily life and virtual life. Though we can eradicate this racism from virtual life (such as Social Media). In this paper, we have tried to detect those racist comments with NLP and deep learning techniques. We have built a novel dataset in the Bengali Language. Further, we annotated the dataset and conducted data label validation. After extensive utilization of deep learning methodologies, we have successfully achieved text detection with an impressive accuracy rate of 87.94\\% using the Ensemble approach. We have applied RNN and LSTM models using BERT Embeddings. However, the MCNN-LSTM model performed highest among all those models. Lastly, the Ensemble approach has been followed to combine all the model results to increase overall performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "种族主义是我们国家以及全世界的一个令人担忧的现象。每天我们在日常生活和虚拟生活中都会遇到一些种族主义言论。虽然我们可以在虚拟生活中消除这种种族主义（例如社交媒体），但在本文中，我们尝试使用自然语言处理和深度学习技术来检测这些种族主义言论。我们建立了一个新颖的孟加拉语数据集。此外，我们对数据集进行了标注并进行了数据标签验证。经过广泛利用深度学习方法，我们使用集成方法成功实现了87.94％的文本检测准确率。我们使用BERT嵌入应用了RNN和LSTM模型。然而，在所有这些模型中，MCNN-LSTM模型表现最好。最后，采用集成方法来结合所有模型结果，以提高整体性能。",
