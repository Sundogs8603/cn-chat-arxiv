    "abstract": "Automatic semantic segmentation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images using deep neural networks greatly assists in evaluating and planning treatments for various clinical applications. However, training these models is conditioned on the availability of abundant annotated data to implement the end-to-end supervised learning procedure. Even if we annotate enough data, MRI images display considerable variability due to factors such as differences in patients, MRI scanners, and imaging protocols. This variability necessitates retraining neural networks for each specific application domain, which, in turn, requires manual annotation by expert radiologists for all new domains. To relax the need for persistent data annotation, we develop a method for unsupervised federated domain adaptation using multiple annotated source domains.

    "translated_abstract": "使用深度神经网络自动对磁共振成像（MRI）图像进行语义分割极大地有助于评估和规划各种临床应用的治疗。然而，训练这些模型需要大量标注数据来实施端到端的监督学习过程。即使我们标注了足够的数据，MRI图像由于患者、MRI扫描仪和成像协议的差异而显示出相当大的变异性。这种变异性需要对每个特定的应用领域重新训练神经网络，这又需要专家放射科医生对所有新领域进行手工注释。为了减轻对持续数据注释的需求，我们开发了一种无监督的联邦领域适应方法，该方法使用多个带有注释的源领域。我们的方法能够从多个带有注释的源域中转移知识，以适应在未注释的目标域中的有效使用。",
