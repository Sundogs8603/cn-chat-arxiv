    "translated_abstract": "小于10厘米直径的纳米无人机由于其适用于较大的飞行无人机无法到达的狭窄环境和人类附近的特点，正变得越来越受关注。然而，其微小的外形也带来了一个主要的缺点：超限的内存和处理器用于其感知流程的机载执行。因此，基于轻量级深度学习的方法越来越受欢迎，强调计算效率和节能的重要性，因为这可以决定一个完全工作的闭环系统和一个失败的闭环系统之间的区别。在本研究中，为了最大限度地利用纳米无人机上极其有限的资源，我们提出了一种新的自适应深度学习机制，用于高效执行基于视觉的人体姿态估计任务。我们结合了两种具有不同回归性能与计算成本折衷的最新卷积神经网络（CNN）。通过将这些CNN与一个自适应分类模块组合起来，我们能够根据计算资源的可用性自适应地选择合适的网络以实现高效的姿态估计。",
