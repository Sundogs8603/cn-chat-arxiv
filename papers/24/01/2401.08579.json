    "abstract": "This research presents a new parametric style transfer framework specifically designed for curve-based design sketches. In this research, traditional challenges faced by neural style transfer methods in handling binary sketch transformations are effectively addressed through the utilization of parametric shape-editing rules, efficient curve-to-pixel conversion techniques, and the fine-tuning of VGG19 on ImageNet-Sketch, enhancing its role as a feature pyramid network for precise style extraction. By harmonizing intuitive curve-based imagery with rule-based editing, this study holds the potential to significantly enhance design articulation and elevate the practice of style transfer within the realm of product design.",
