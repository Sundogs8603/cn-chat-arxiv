    "translated_abstract": "疾病控制专家每天会检查公共卫生数据流中的异常值，如与数据质量问题或疾病爆发相关的异常值。然而，他们只能检查到由应用于大规模公共卫生数据流的单变量异常值检测方法返回的少数几个最大绑定异常值。为了帮助专家从这些成千上万个绑定的异常值中区分出最重要的异常值，我们提出了一种新的任务，即对应用于许多数据流的任何单变量方法的输出进行排名。我们为这个任务提出的新颖算法，在使用公共卫生数据流进行人工专家评估时，在传统的异常值检测指标中表现最好。最重要的是，自2023年4月以来，专家们已经使用我们的开源Python实现，并报告比之前的基线快了9.1倍地发现值得调查的异常值。其他组织可以轻松地阅读和使用我们的实现来提高异常值的发现速度。",
