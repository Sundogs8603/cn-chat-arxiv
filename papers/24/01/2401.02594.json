    "abstract": "We present Unsupervised hard Negative Augmentation (UNA), a method that generates synthetic negative instances based on the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) retrieval model. UNA uses TF-IDF scores to ascertain the perceived importance of terms in a sentence and then produces negative samples by replacing terms with respect to that. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with UNA improve the overall performance in semantic textual similarity tasks. Additional performance gains are obtained when combining UNA with the paraphrasing augmentation. Further results show that our method is compatible with different backbone models. Ablation studies also support the choice of having a TF-IDF-driven control on negative augmentation.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种无监督的硬负样本增强（UNA）方法，该方法基于词频-逆文档频率（TF-IDF）检索模型生成合成的负样本。UNA使用TF-IDF分数确定句子中术语的感知重要性，并通过替换术语来生成负样本。我们的实验证明，使用UNA训练的模型在语义文本相似性任务上提高了整体性能。当将UNA与释义增强相结合时，还可获得额外的性能提升。进一步的结果表明，我们的方法与不同的骨干模型兼容。消融研究还支持在负样本增强中具有基于TF-IDF的控制选择。",
