    "translated_abstract": "大规模预训练模型（PTM）的普及日益增加，引发了对模型中心和专门用于托管PTM的平台的兴趣。尽管存在这一趋势，但关于用户遇到的挑战以及社区如何利用PTM的全面探索仍然缺乏。为了弥补这一空白，我们进行了一项广泛的混合方法实证研究，重点关注HuggingFace的讨论论坛和模型中心，这是最大的公共模型中心。根据我们的定性分析，我们提出了在该社区中重用PTM所涉及的挑战和益处的分类法。然后，我们进行了一项定量研究，跟踪模型类型的趋势和模型文档的演进。我们的研究结果突出了一些普遍存在的挑战，例如给初学者提供有限的指导，模型在训练或推理中的输出理解困难以及缺乏模型理解。我们还发现了一些有趣的模型趋势，其中一些模型保持着高上传率。",
