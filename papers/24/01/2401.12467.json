    "translated_abstract": "最早的中文字符源自甲骨文铭文，与其他东亚语言密切相关。这些铭文对人类学和考古学具有巨大价值。然而，解读甲骨文仍然是一个巨大的挑战，迄今为止只有约1600个4500多个现存字符得到诠释。需要进一步的学术研究，全面了解这种古代书写系统。人工智能技术在解读甲骨文字符方面具有潜力，特别是在字符演变方面。然而，挑战之一是缺乏映射这些字符演变的数据集。在本研究中，我们系统地收集了古代字符，涵盖了甲骨文（公元前15世纪）、金文（公元前13世纪至公元221年）、篆书（公元前11至8世纪）、秦简（公元前221至206年）、小篆（公元前206至8世纪）、楷书（公元2至5世纪）这六个历史阶段的文字。",
