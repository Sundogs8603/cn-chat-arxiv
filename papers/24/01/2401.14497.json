    "translated_abstract": "深度学习在皮肤科任务中取得的显著进展使我们更接近于达到与人类专家相当的诊断准确性。然而，尽管大型数据集在可靠的深度神经网络模型的开发中起着关键作用，但数据集中的数据质量和其正确使用至关重要。多种因素可以影响数据质量，如重复数据的存在，训练-测试分区的数据泄漏，错误标记的图像以及缺乏明确定义的测试分区。在本文中，我们对两个流行的皮肤科图像数据集DermaMNIST和Fitzpatrick17k进行了详细分析，揭示了这些数据质量问题，测量了这些问题对基准结果的影响，并对数据集提出了纠正措施。通过公开我们的分析流程和配套代码，确保我们分析的可重复性，我们旨在鼓励类似的探索并促进这方面的研究发展。",
