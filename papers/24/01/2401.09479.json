    "translated_abstract": "在零信任的无厂无印造制造时代，硬件特洛伊在芯片生产的各个阶段被插入的风险增加了。为了应对这一问题，已经开发了各种机器学习解决方案用于检测硬件特洛伊。尽管大部分关注点都集中在统计学或深度学习方法上，但受到特洛伊感染基准样本数量有限的影响，检测准确性受限，无法检测到零日特洛伊。为了填补这一差距，我们首先采用生成对抗网络来扩充数据，以两种替代表示模态，图形和表格，确保数据集以代表性的方式分布。此外，我们提出了一种多模态深度学习方法来检测硬件特洛伊，并评估了早融合和晚融合策略的结果。我们还估计了每个预测的不确定性量化指标，用于风险感知的决策制定。结果不仅确认了我们方法的有效性，而且表明了不确定性估计对硬件特洛伊检测的重要性。",
