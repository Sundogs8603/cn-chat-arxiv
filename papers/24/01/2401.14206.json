    "abstract": "The liver is the most involved organ by distant metastasis in colon-rectal cancer (CRC) patients and it comes necessary to be aware of the mutational status of the lesions to correctly design the best individual treatment. So far, efforts have been made in order to develop non-invasive and real-time methods that permit the analysis of the whole tumor, using new artificial intelligence tools to analyze the tumor's image obtained by Computed Tomography (CT) scan. In order to address the current medical workflow, that is biopsy analysis-based, we propose the first DeepLearning-based exploration, to our knowledge, of such classification approach from the patient medical imaging. We propose i) a solid pipeline for managing undersized datasets of available CT scans and ii) a baseline study for genomics mutation diagnosis support for preemptive patient follow-up. Our method is able to identify CRC RAS mutation family from CT images with 0.73 F1 score.",

    "translated_abstract": "肝脏是结直肠癌（CRC）患者远端转移最常见的器官，了解病变的突变状态对正确设计最佳个体化治疗非常重要。迄今为止，人们为了开发非侵入性和实时的方法，通过使用新的人工智能工具分析计算机断层扫描（CT）所得到的肿瘤影像，以便分析整个肿瘤。为了解决目前基于活检分析的医疗工作流程，我们提出了首个基于深度学习的方法，通过患者医学影像进行突变分类。我们提出了i）一个管理可用CT扫描数据集的可靠流程和ii）基因突变诊断支持的基线研究，以进行预防性患者随访。我们的方法能够在CT图像中以0.73的F1得分识别CRC RAS突变家族。",
