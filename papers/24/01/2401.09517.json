    "abstract": "Machine learning has been increasingly used to obtain individualized neuroimaging signatures for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and response to treatment in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, it has contributed to a better understanding of disease heterogeneity by identifying disease subtypes that present significant differences in various brain phenotypic measures. In this review, we first present a systematic literature overview of studies using machine learning and multimodal MRI to unravel disease heterogeneity in various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, as well as their potential in transdiagnostic settings. Subsequently, we summarize relevant machine learning methodologies and discuss an emerging paradigm which we call dimensional neuroimaging endophenotype (DNE).

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习越来越多地用于获取神经影像学特征，以对神经精神疾病和神经退行性疾病的诊断、预后和治疗反应进行个体化。因此，它通过识别在各种大脑表型测量上存在显着差异的疾病亚型，为我们更好地理解疾病异质性做出了贡献。在这篇综述中，我们首先提供了使用机器学习和多模态MRI揭示各种神经精神疾病和神经退行性疾病中的疾病异质性的系统文献综述，包括阿尔茨海默病、精神分裂症、重性抑郁障碍、自闭症谱系障碍、多发性硬化症，以及它们在横断面的潜力。随后，我们总结了相关的机器学习方法，并讨论了一个新兴的范式，我们将其称为神经影像学的维度内部表现（DNE）。DNE分解了神经科学的异质性",
