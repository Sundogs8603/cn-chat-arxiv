    "translated_abstract": "我们认为，在经验分析中涵盖大量自由度能更好地描述效应，从而提高结论的可信度。我们通过三个研究来说明我们的观点：股票溢价预测、资产定价异常和风险溢价估计。在第一个研究中，我们发现，协议中每增加一个自由度，t统计量的平均范围至少扩大30％。在第二个研究中，我们展示了相对于自助法在多重检验中使用分叉路径会提高异常的显著性门槛：在95％的置信水平下，自助法的阈值为4.5，而采用路径则至少为8.2，远高于目前文献中使用的门槛。在我们的第三个应用中，我们揭示了溢价估计中特定步骤的重要性。此外，我们使用路径来支持这三个主题中的先前发现。我们记录了在复制先前研究中的能力中的异质性。",

Through three studies, it shows that increasing degrees of freedom and utilizing forking paths can enhance the prediction of equity premiums, raise the significance thresholds for anomalies, and highlight the importance of specific steps in premium estimation."
