    "translated_abstract": "交互式机器学习（IML）旨在将人类专业知识与机器学习过程相结合。然而，大多数现有算法不能应用于实际场景，因为它们的状态空间和/或行为空间仅限于离散值。此外，所有现有方法之间的交互受到在多个建议之间做出决策的限制。因此，我们提出了一种基于贝叶斯优化（BO）的新型框架。交互式贝叶斯优化（IBO）实现了机器学习算法和人类之间的合作。该框架捕捉用户偏好，并提供界面给用户手动调整策略。此外，我们还加入了一种新的收益函数，偏好预期改善（PEI），通过用户偏好的概率模型来提高系统的效率。我们的方法旨在确保机器能从人类专业知识中受益，以实现更加协调和有效的学习过程。",
