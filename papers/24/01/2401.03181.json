    "translated_abstract": "医学问答（QA）助手通过使用自然语言处理和相关技术从多个信息源合成信息来回答普通用户的健康相关问题。它们可以作为重要工具来缓解误导、信息过载和医学术语复杂性问题，从而满足普通用户的信息需求并减轻医疗保健专业人员的负担。QA系统通常使用语言模型（LM）或知识图谱（KG），尽管这两种方法可以互补。基于LM的QA系统擅长理解复杂问题并提供合适的答案，但易于出现事实错误。基于KG的QA系统能够很好地表示事实，但大多数仅限于回答已预先创建模板的简短问题。虽然一些研究已经联合使用了LM和KG方法来进行基于文本的QA，但这是用于回答多项选择题。现有的QA系统也存在一些问题。",
