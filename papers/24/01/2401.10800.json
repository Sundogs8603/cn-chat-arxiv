    "translated_abstract": "大西洋经度翻转环流（AMOC）是全球气候的重要组成部分，被认为是一个临界因素，可以在全球变暖下崩溃。本研究的主要目标是使用一种稀事件算法（Trajectory-Adaptive Multilevel Splitting，TAMS）计算AMOC在指定时间窗口内崩溃的概率。然而，TAMS的效率和准确性取决于得分函数的选择。虽然已知最佳得分函数的定义，称为“确定函数”，但通常无法先验地计算它。在这里，我们将TAMS与下一代水库计算技术相结合，该技术可以从稀事件算法生成的数据中估计确定函数。我们在AMOC的随机盒模型中测试了这种技术，该模型存在两种转变类型，称为F（快速）转变和S（缓慢）转变。F转变的结果与那些进行了有利比较。",
