    "translated_abstract": "作为位置基础社交网络(LBSN)中不可或缺的个性化服务，POI（兴趣点）推荐旨在帮助个人发现有趣和吸引人的地方。然而，精确的推荐能力依赖于强大的服务器收集大量用户的历史签到数据，存在重大的隐私泄露风险。尽管一些用于POI推荐的协作学习(CL)框架增强了推荐的韧性并允许用户保持设备上的个人数据，但它们仍然会共享个人知识以提高推荐性能，从而给潜在攻击者留下了漏洞。因此，我们设计了一种新的物理轨迹推断攻击(PTIA)来暴露用户的历史轨迹。具体而言，对于每个用户，我们通过分析目标POI及其相关POI的聚合信息，来确定用户的互动POI集合。我们评估了PTIA在两个真实数据集上的有效性。",

By analyzing aggregated information from target POIs and their correlated POIs, the attack can identify the set of interacted POIs for each user. The PTIA highlights the privacy risks of collaborative learning-based POI recommendation."
