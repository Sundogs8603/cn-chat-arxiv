    "translated_abstract": "在存在固有噪声的情况下，深度学习模型的强健泛化仍然是一个重大挑战，尤其当标签是主观的并且噪声在自然环境中很难辨别时。这个问题在许多实际应用中特别明显。在本文中，我们解决了监测自杀倾向的特殊且重要的情景，其中时间序列数据，如光电容积图（PPG），易受此类噪声影响。当前的方法主要集中在图像和文本数据或处理人为引入的噪声上，忽视了时间序列分析中的自然噪声的复杂性。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一种专门用于分析带有噪声的生理时间序列数据的新型神经网络模型，称为TNANet，它将先进的编码技术与置信度学习相结合，提高了预测准确性。我们的另一个贡献是收集了一个专门从现实环境中获取的PPG信号的数据集，用于自杀倾向的预测。",
