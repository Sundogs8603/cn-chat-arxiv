    "translated_abstract": "在疫情后的时代，消费复苏具有明显的时空传导规律，不同消费领域存在不同的估值标准。本文利用2022年1月至4月A股消费复苏阶段的数据，定量比较了估值回归合理范围时不同消费领域之间的滚动传导效应。根据“感官为基础的消费”新分类，解读了数字消费作为A股升级工具和更高估值目标的内在逻辑，并阐述了“滚动传导效应”。从时间和空间传导的角度解释了消费复苏和估值回归周期的规律。研究发现，在消费复苏的早期阶段，消费者信心的恢复较为缓慢。在此期间，A股市场主要由股本博弈主导，并存在明显的板块轮动规律。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study reveals the roller conduction effect within different consumer sectors in the process of valuation regression in A-share market, highlighting the significance of digital consumption as an upgrade tool and a higher valuation target. It further observes the slow recovery of consumer confidence in the early stage of consumption recovery, which leads to a dominance of stock capital game and obvious plate rotation patterns."
