    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年中，数据和计算资源的普及性不断增加，推动了机器学习范式向更分布式的方法转变。这种转变不仅旨在解决可扩展性和资源分布挑战，还要解决紧迫的隐私和安全问题。为了对这一持续讨论做出贡献，本文介绍了Holonic Learning (HoL)，这是一个专为训练深度学习模型而设计的协作和注重隐私的学习框架。通过利用Holonic概念，HoL框架在学习过程中建立了一个结构化的自相似层次结构，通过每个holon的个体模型聚合方法以及它们的内部holon承诺和通信模式，实现对协作的更细致控制。Holonic Learning在其通用形式中提供了广泛的设计和灵活性潜力。为了经验分析和展示其效果，本文实现了Holo",
