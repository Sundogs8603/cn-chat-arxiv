    "translated_abstract": "最近人们经常重视规则集学习，因为它具有可解释性。然而，现有的方法存在一些缺点。首先，大多数现有方法在规则之间明确或隐含地强加顺序，这使得模型更难以理解。其次，由于处理重叠引起的冲突（即，被多个规则覆盖的实例）的困难，现有方法通常不考虑概率规则。第三，对于多类别目标的学习分类规则研究不足，因为大多数现有方法专注于二分类或通过\"一对其余\"方法进行多类别分类。为了解决这些缺点，我们提出了TURS，即真正无序规则集。为了解决重叠规则引起的冲突，我们提出了一种新颖的模型，利用我们的规则集的概率特性，只有当它们具有相似的概率输出时允许规则重叠。我们接下来对学习问题进行了形式化定义。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents the Probabilistic Truly Unordered Rule Sets (TURS) approach to address the shortcomings in rule set learning, including imposed order, conflict caused by overlaps, and multi-class classification. It proposes a novel model that utilizes the probabilistic properties of rule sets to resolve conflicts and formalizes the learning problem."
