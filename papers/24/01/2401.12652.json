    "abstract": "In this paper, we present ECL, a novel multi-modal dataset containing the textual and numerical data from corporate 10K filings and associated binary bankruptcy labels. Furthermore, we develop and critically evaluate several classical and neural bankruptcy prediction models using this dataset. Our findings suggest that the information contained in each data modality is complementary for bankruptcy prediction. We also see that the binary bankruptcy prediction target does not enable our models to distinguish next year bankruptcy from an unhealthy financial situation resulting in bankruptcy in later years. Finally, we explore the use of LLMs in the context of our task. We show how GPT-based models can be used to extract meaningful summaries from the textual data but zero-shot bankruptcy prediction results are poor. All resources required to access and update the dataset or replicate our experiments are available on github.com/henriarnoUG/ECL.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了ECL数据集，该数据集包含了公司10K备案文件的文本和数值数据以及相关的二元破产标签。此外，我们使用该数据集开发和评估了多种经典和神经网络破产预测模型。我们的研究结果表明，每种数据模态中包含的信息对于破产预测是互补的。我们还发现，二元破产预测目标并不能使我们的模型区分明年破产和导致后年破产的不健康财务状况。最后，我们探索了在我们的任务背景下使用GPT模型来提取文本数据的有意义摘要的可能性，但零样本破产预测结果较差。访问和复现我们的实验所需的所有资源都可在github.com/henriarnoUG/ECL上获得。",
