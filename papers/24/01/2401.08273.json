    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了零射击提示方法。零射击提示利用大规模语言模型（LLMs）中的错误信息，通过指示LLMs利用从“示例”部分中获取的信息（该信息在所提供的上下文中不存在）来完成任务。虽然减少错误信息对于LLMs的日常和重要用途至关重要，但我们提出在目前的环境中，这些LLMs仍然具有错误信息，实际上可以利用错误信息来提高与标准零射击提示相比的任务表现。对八个LLMs进行实验，结果显示在大多数八个数据集（包括阅读理解、算术推理和闭卷问答）中，性能有所提升。观察到的不一致性增加相对性能在LLMs之间的差异，也可能表示每个模型中存在不同程度的错误信息。",
