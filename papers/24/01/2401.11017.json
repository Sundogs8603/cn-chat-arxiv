    "translated_abstract": "说话者嵌入携带有有价值的与情感相关的信息，使其成为增强语音情感识别（SER）的有前景的资源，特别是在有限标注数据情况下。传统上，人们认为情感信息是间接嵌入在说话者嵌入中的，导致它们的利用不足。我们的研究揭示了情感与最先进的说话者嵌入之间的直接而有用的联系，即内部说话者聚类的形式。通过进行详尽的聚类分析，我们证明情感信息可以很容易地从说话者嵌入中提取出来。为了利用这些信息，我们引入了一种新颖的对抗预训练方法，应用于情感未标记数据的语音情感识别。所提出的方法涉及根据说话者嵌入的内部聚类来采样正例和负例。该策略利用大量的情感未标记数据，导致明显的效果提升。",
