    "translated_abstract": "时间序列数据的异常检测对于识别故障、失败、威胁和异常值在各种应用中至关重要。最近，深度学习技术已被应用于此主题，但它们在复杂和高度动态的实际场景中往往面临困难，例如正常数据可能由多个分布组成，不同程度的异常可能与正常数据不同。在这项工作中，为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了分布增强对比重建（DACR）。DACR生成与正常数据分布不相交的额外数据来压缩正常数据的表示空间，并通过对比学习增强特征提取器，以更好地捕获时间序列数据的内在语义。此外，DACR采用注意力机制来建模多变量时间序列特征之间的语义依赖关系，从而实现更强大的异常检测重建。大量实验证明",
