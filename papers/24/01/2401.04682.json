Our approach uses a mixture of multilayer Stochastic Block Models (SBM) to group co-membership matrices with similar information into components and to partition observations into different clusters, taking into account their specificities within the components.

    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们提出了一种用于聚合来自不同信息源的多个聚类的原始方法。每个分区由观测之间的共属性矩阵进行编码。我们的方法使用了混合多层次随机块模型（SBM）将具有相似信息的共属性矩阵分组为组件，并将观测分区到不同的聚类中，考虑到它们在组件内的特定性。模型参数的可识别性被建立，并提出了一个变分贝叶斯EM算法来估计这些参数。贝叶斯框架允许选择最优的聚类和组件数量。利用合成数据将提出的方法与共识聚类和基于张量的算法进行了比较，用于大规模复杂网络中的社区检测。最后，该方法被用于分析全球食品贸易网络，得到了有趣的结构。",
