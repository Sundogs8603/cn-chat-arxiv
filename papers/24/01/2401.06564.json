    "translated_abstract": "近年来，已提出了各种方法来估计因果效应，并通过后模型选择或机器学习估计器对高维度干扰模型进行估计，从而获得统一有效的置信区间。这些方法通常要求观测到所有混淆因素以确保效果的识别。我们的贡献在于展示了如何在存在未观测到的混淆因素和高维度干扰模型的情况下获得有效的半参数推断。我们提出了不确定性区间，允许存在未观测到的混淆，并且当未观测到的混淆相对于样本量很小时，结果推断是有效的；后者用收敛速率来形式化。通过仿真实验，我们展示了所提出的区间的有限样本性质，并研究了一种改进区间的经验覆盖率的替代程序，当未观测到的混淆的数量较大时，可以提高区间的覆盖率。",
