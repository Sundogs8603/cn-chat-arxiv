    "translated_abstract": "随着对包容性和用户友好技术的需求不断增加，网页无障碍对于确保残障人士(包括视觉、听觉、认知或运动障碍)平等获取在线内容至关重要。尽管存在诸如Web内容无障碍指南(WCAG)和Web无障碍倡议(W3C)等无障碍指导方针和标准，但超过90%的网站仍无法满足必要的无障碍要求。对于残障人士来说，需要一种工具来自动修复网页的无障碍错误。虽然研究已经证明了发现和定位无障碍错误的方法，但没有研究专注于有效修复此类违规行为。本文提出了一种通过实时修改文档对象模型(DOM)来修复网页无障碍违规的新方法，该方法利用无障碍错误信息、大型语言模型(LLMs)和提示工程技术。",
