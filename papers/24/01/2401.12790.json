    "translated_abstract": "概念漂移对于恶意软件检测来说是一个重要的挑战，因为训练好的机器学习模型的性能会随着时间的推移而下降，使其变得不实用。尽管之前的恶意软件概念漂移适应研究主要集中在主动学习上，即通过选择代表性样本来更新模型，但自训练已经成为缓解概念漂移的一种有希望的方法。自训练是指使用伪标签重新训练模型以适应数据分布的变化。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种名为MORPH的有效基于伪标签的概念漂移适应方法，专门为神经网络设计。通过对Android和Windows恶意软件数据集的大量实验分析，我们证明了我们的方法在缓解概念漂移方面的有效性。我们的方法在与主动学习相结合时，降低了注释工作量。此外，我们的方法在准确性和鲁棒性方面显著优于现有的方法。",
