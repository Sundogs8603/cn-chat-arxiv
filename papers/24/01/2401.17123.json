    "translated_abstract": "深度生成模型(DGMs)广泛用于图数据。然而，对于这种预训练图DGMs的潜在空间的理解研究相对较少。这些理解有潜力为重要任务提供有益的指导，例如图的可控制生成。因此，在这项工作中，我们对这个问题很感兴趣，并提出GraphCG，一种用于在预训练图DGMs的潜在空间中无监督发现可操纵因素的方法。我们首先使用六个解缠度度量标准检验了三个预训练图DGMs的表示空间，并观察到预训练表示空间是交织的。受这个观察的启发，GraphCG通过最大化语义丰富方向之间的互信息来学习可操纵因素，沿着相同方向移动的图将共享相同的可操纵因素。我们定量验证了GraphCG优于其他四个竞争方法。",
