This is achieved by directly calibrating the output embeddings of the model using an efficient and effective linear mapping. This mapping is powered by an edit operator that is obtained by solving a specially constructed least squares problem. Compared to implicit rule modification via long-time finetuning, our experimental results show that DREditor provides significant advantages on different domain-specific datasets, dataset sources, retrieval models, and computing devices. It consistently enhances time efficiency by 100-300 times while maintain",

    "translated_abstract": "在不同行业中，有效部署密集检索模型变得越来越重要。这在企业搜索服务中尤为如此，因为需求不同领域的不同企业的时间需求不同。出于这个原因，我们开发了一种名为DREditor的时间高效方法，用于编辑现成的密集检索模型的匹配规则，以适应特定领域。通过直接校准模型的输出嵌入，使用一种高效而有效的线性映射来实现这一点。这种映射是由解决一个特殊构建的最小二乘问题获得的编辑操作符驱动的。与通过长时间微调进行隐式规则修改相比，我们的实验结果表明，DREditor在不同的特定领域数据集、数据集来源、检索模型和计算设备上都提供了显著优势。它始终可以提高时间效率100-300倍，同时保持不变。",
