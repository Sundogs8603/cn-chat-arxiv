    "translated_title": "为什么使用大型语言模型解决多智能体路径规划尚未成功",
    "translated_abstract": "随着ChatGPT和GPT-4等大型语言模型（LLM）的成功引发的爆炸性影响，最近的许多研究表明基础模型可以用于解决各种任务。然而，在多智能体规划方面，很少有研究分享见解。多智能体规划不同于其他领域，它将多智能体协调和规划的困难结合起来，使得难以利用外部工具促进所需的推理。本文重点研究多智能体路径规划（MAPF）问题，也被称为多机器人路径规划，并研究了使用LLM解决MAPF的性能。我们首先展示了在没有障碍物的空房间地图上的激励性成功，然后展示了对标准MAPF基准测试中较难的房间地图和迷宫地图的规划失败。我们阐述了直接使用LLM解决MAPF尚未成功的立场，并通过各种实验来支撑我们的观点。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了使用大型语言模型解决多智能体路径规划的问题。通过实验，我们发现直接使用大型语言模型解决复杂场景下的路径规划仍然存在困难。",
