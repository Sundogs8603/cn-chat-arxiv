    "translated_abstract": "森林砍伐是气候变化的主要原因之一，会导致农业部门的中断、全球变暖、山洪暴发和滑坡等不利后果。传统的城市街道树木清查方法存在精度不准确和对专业设备的依赖的问题。为了克服这些挑战，本论文提出了一种创新的方法，利用深度学习技术和手机影像进行城市街道树木清查。我们的方法利用智能手机摄像头拍摄的一对图像来精确地分割树干并计算胸径。与传统方法相比，我们的方法具有以下几个优点，包括更高的准确性、对专业设备的依赖较低和适用于难以接触的地区。我们在一个包含400颗树的综合数据集上评估了我们的方法，并且在胸径估算准确率方面达到了小于2.5%的误差率。我们的方法具有显著的潜力可以大幅度改善城市街道树木清查。",
