    "translated_abstract": "手术工具分割和动作识别是许多计算机辅助干预应用的基本构建模块，从手术技能评估到决策支持系统。现在，基于学习的动作识别和分割方法在性能上优于传统方法，但依赖于大规模的注释数据集。此外，动作识别和工具分割算法通常是在彼此孤立地训练和预测，没有利用潜在的交叉任务关系。通过EndoVis 2022 SAR-RARP50挑战，我们发布了第一个多模态的、公开的、体内的手术动作识别和语义仪器分割数据集，其中包含50个机器人辅助根治性前列腺切除术（RARP）的缝合视频片段。挑战的目标是两方面的。首先，让研究人员利用提供的数据集规模，开发出稳健且高准确性的单任务动作识别方法。",
