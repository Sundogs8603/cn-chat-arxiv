    "abstract": "About two million U.S. corporations and partnerships are linked to each other and human investors by about 15 million owner-subsidiary links. Comparable social networks such as corporate board memberships and socially-built systems such as the network of Internet links are \"small worlds,\" meaning a network with a small diameter and link densities with a power-law distribution, but these properties had not yet been measured for the business entity network. This article shows that both inbound links and outbound links display a power-law distribution with a coefficient of concentration estimable to within a generally narrow confidence interval, overall, for subnetworks including only business entities, only for the great connected component of the network, and in subnetworks with edges associated with certain industries, for all years 2009-2021. In contrast to other networks with power-law distributed link densities, the network is mostly a tree, and has a diameter an order of magnitude ",

    "translated_abstract": "大约有两百万家美国企业和合伙企业与彼此和人类投资者之间通过约1500万个所有-子公司链接相互连接。类似的社交网络，如公司董事会的成员和社交构建的系统，如互联网链接网络，都是“小世界”，这意味着网络直径较小，链接密度呈幂律分布，但这些属性尚未被用于衡量公司实体网络。本文表明，无论是入站链接还是出站链接，都显示出幂律分布，并且具有可估计的集中系数，整体而言，对于仅包括商务实体的子网络，仅对于网络的主连接组件，以及对于与特定行业相关的边缘子网络，所有年份2009-2021都适用于通常较窄的置信区间。与其他具有幂律分布链接密度的网络相比，该网络主要是一棵树，并且直径相差一个数量级。",

    "en_tdlr": "This article presents important metrics of the capital network in the U.S. economy, demonstrating a power-law distribution of both inbound and outbound links. The concentration coefficient is estimated to be stable for subnetworks, the main connected component, and industry-related subnetworks. Unlike other networks with power-law distributed link densities, this network is primarily a tree with a significantly different diameter."
