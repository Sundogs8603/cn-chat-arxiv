    "abstract": "This document presents a stock market analysis conducted on a dataset consisting of 750 instances and 16 attributes donated in 2014-10-23. The analysis includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) section, feature engineering, data preparation, model selection, and insights from the analysis. The Fama French 3-factor model is also utilized in the analysis. The results of the analysis are presented, with linear regression being the best-performing model.",
