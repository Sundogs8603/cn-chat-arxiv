    "translated_abstract": "跨目标立场检测(CTSD)是一项重要任务，通过利用源目标产生的注释数据来推断目的目标的态度。CTSD中的一种重要方法是提取域不变特征以填补多个目标之间的知识差距。然而，非正式和短文本结构的分析以及隐含表达使得提取域不变知识变得复杂。本文提出了一种多视角提示调整(MPPT)模型用于CTSD，该模型将分析视角作为知识传递的桥梁。首先，我们开发了一个基于指令的两阶段思维链(TsCoT)方法，通过基于大型语言模型(LLM)的指令制定，从多个视角提取目标分析视角并提供自然语言解释(NLEs)。接着，我们提出了一个多视角提示调节框架(MultiPLN)，将NLEs融合到立场预测器中。进行了大量实验来验证我们的方法。",
