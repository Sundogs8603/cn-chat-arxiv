    "abstract": "The Ising model, originally developed as a spin-glass model for ferromagnetic elements, has gained popularity as a network-based model for capturing dependencies in agents' outputs. Its increasing adoption in healthcare and the social sciences has raised privacy concerns regarding the confidentiality of agents' responses. In this paper, we present a novel $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-differentially private algorithm specifically designed to protect the privacy of individual agents' outcomes. Our algorithm allows for precise estimation of the natural parameter using a single network through an objective perturbation technique. Furthermore, we establish regret bounds for this algorithm and assess its performance on synthetic datasets and two real-world networks: one involving HIV status in a social network and the other concerning the political leaning of online blogs.",

    "translated_abstract": "Ising模型最初作为铁磁元素自旋模型而开发，已经被广泛应用于捕捉代理输出之间的依赖性的网络模型。它在医疗保健和社会科学领域的不断应用引发了关于代理响应机密性的隐私担忧。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的$(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-差分隐私算法，专门设计用于保护个体代理结果的隐私。我们的算法通过目标扰动技术，允许对自然参数使用单一网络进行精确估计。此外，我们为该算法建立了遗憾界限，并在合成数据集和两个现实世界的网络上评估了其性能：一个涉及社交网络中的HIV状况，另一个涉及在线博客的政治倾向。",
