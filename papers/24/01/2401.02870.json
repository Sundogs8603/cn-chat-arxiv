    "translated_abstract": "大语言模型的发展引入了一种新的方法来研究人类行为仿真。最近的研究利用基于大语言模型的代理创建了一个社会学研究环境，代理基于大语言模型的未过滤特征展示行为。然而，这些研究忽视了在类似人类环境中的迭代发展 - 人类的偏好和个性是复杂的，受到各种因素的影响，并且因环境和主观影响而不断变化。鉴于这一观察，我们提出了一个用于塑造偏好和个性的代理框架（AFSPP），探索社交网络和主观意识对基于大语言模型的代理的偏好和个性形成的多方面影响。通过AFSPP，我们首次成功复制了几个人类个性实验的关键发现。其他基于AFSPP的实验结果表明，计划制定...",
