    "translated_abstract": "长期交通预测一直是一项具有挑战性的任务，由于其动态时间依赖性和复杂的空间依赖性。本文提出了一种将混合Transformer和时空自监督学习相结合的模型。该模型通过在交通数据的序列级和图级应用自适应数据增强技术，增强了其鲁棒性。它利用Transformer克服了循环神经网络在捕捉长期序列方面的局限性，并采用Chebyshev多项式图卷积来捕捉复杂的空间依赖性。此外，考虑到时空异质性对交通速度的影响，我们设计了两个自监督学习任务来建模时空异质性，从而提高了模型的准确性和泛化能力。在两个实际数据集PeMS04和PeMS08上进行了实验评估，并进行了可视化和分析，展示了模型的效果。",
