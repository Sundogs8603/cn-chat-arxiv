    "translated_abstract": "计算机模拟（即白盒模型）在模拟复杂工程系统方面比以往任何时候都更加必不可少。然而，仅凭计算模型往往无法完全捕捉现实的复杂性。当物理实验可行时，增强计算模型提供的不完整信息变得非常重要。灰盒建模涉及到将数据驱动模型（即黑盒模型）和白盒模型（即基于物理的模型）的信息融合的问题。在本文中，我们提出使用多保真度代理模型（MFSMs）来执行这个任务。MFSM将不同计算保真度的模型的信息集成到一个新的代理模型中。我们提出的多保真度代理建模框架能够处理被噪声污染的数据，并能够估计底层无噪声的高保真度函数。我们的方法强调以置信度的形式提供其预测中不确定性的精确估计。",
