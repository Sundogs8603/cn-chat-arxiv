    "translated_abstract": "电子商务顾客经常寻求详细的产品信息以做出购买决策，通常通过直接向卖家发送扩展查询来联系。这种手动回复要求增加了额外的成本，并且在响应时间波动范围从几小时到几天时干扰了顾客的购物体验。我们旨在使用领先的电子商务商店中的特定领域联合问答（QA）系统自动处理顾客对卖家的询问。主要挑战是将当前为单个问题设计的QA系统调整为解决详细的顾客查询。我们通过一种低延迟的序列到序列方法——MESSAGE-TO-QUESTION（M2Q）来解决这个问题，它通过从消息中识别和提取最重要的信息来将买家消息重新构建成简洁的问题。与基线的评估显示，M2Q在问题理解方面相对增加了757%，在联合问答系统中的回答率增加了1746%。实际部署表明，自动化回答系统可以以一个平均的回答速率快4.67倍。",
