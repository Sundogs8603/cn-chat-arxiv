To better understand the accumulation and allocation of capital among different sectors, the present paper applies this statistical fields description to a large number of heterogeneous agents divided into two groups.

    "translated_abstract": "我们在一系列文章中表明，对大量经济主体的经典描述可以用统计场形式主义来替代。为了更好地理解不同部门之间的资本积累和分配，本文将这种统计场描述应用于由大量异质个体分为两组的情况。第一组由不同部门的大量企业组成，他们共同拥有全部实物资本。第二组则是投资者，持有全部金融资本，并根据投资偏好、预期收益和金融市场上的股价变动将其分配给不同部门的企业。作为回报，企业向投资者支付股息。金融资本因此是股息和股票估值的函数，而实物资本则是由金融部门分配的总资本的函数。而我们以前的工作则侧重于背景场。",
    "tldr": "通过统计场形式主义，本文研究了资本在不同部门之间的积累和分配。结果发现，金融资本与股息和股票估值相关，而实物资本与金融部门的资本分配相关。",
    "en_tdlr": "Using statistical fields formalism, this paper explores the accumulation and allocation of capital among different sectors. It finds that financial capital is linked to dividends and stock valuations, while physical capital is related to the allocation of capital by the financial sector."
