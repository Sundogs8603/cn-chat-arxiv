    "translated_abstract": "对基于学习的轨迹预测器的对抗攻击已经得到了证明，但是关于除了状态历史以外的轨迹预测器输入的扰动效果以及这些攻击对下游规划和控制的影响仍然存在一些问题。在本文中，我们对两个轨迹预测模型Trajectron++和AgentFormer进行了敏感性分析。我们观察到，在所有的输入中，Trajectron++的几乎所有扰动敏感性仅限于最近的状态历史时间点，而AgentFormer的扰动敏感性则分布在随时间变化的状态历史中。我们还演示了尽管对状态历史的扰动具有主导的敏感性，但使用快速梯度符号法制作的不可检测的图像地图扰动可以导致这两个模型中的预测误差大幅增加。尽管图像地图对于这两个模型的预测输出可能只有轻微的贡献，但这个结果揭示了一个问题：攻击者可以通过扰动图像地图来破坏自动驾驶系统的轨迹预测性能。",
