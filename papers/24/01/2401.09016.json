    "translated_abstract": "我们展示了如何通过并行化Langevin算法（或欠阻尼的Langevin算法）从满足对数Sobolev不等式且具有平滑的对数密度的分布π中并行采样。我们证明我们的算法输出的样本遵循Kullback-Leibler（KL）散度（或者总变差（TV）距离）接近π的分布π。同时我们的算法只使用O(log(d))个并行轮次和O(d)（或O(√d)个）梯度评估。这是第一个具有TV距离保证的并行采样算法。对于我们的主要应用，我们展示了如何将我们算法的TV距离保证与之前的工作相结合，从而得到对于超立方体上的离散分布族的RNC采样-计数缩减。这些分布族在指数倾斜下保持封闭且有有界协方差。因此，我们得到了一个用于有向欧拉通路和非对称确定的RNC采样器。",
