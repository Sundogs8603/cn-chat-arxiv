    "translated_abstract": "对于自然语言处理 (NLP) 任务来说，非洲语言资源稀缺是一个独特的挑战，包括自然语言生成 (NLG)。在本文中，我们开发了Cheetah，一个面向非洲语言的大规模多语种NLG语言模型。Cheetah支持517种非洲语言和语言变体，解决了NLG资源匮乏问题，并为促进语言多样性提供了解决方案。我们通过七个生成下游任务的综合评估证明了Cheetah的有效性。在七个任务中的五个任务中，Cheetah的表现显著优于其他模型，展示了其在广泛范围的非洲语言中生成连贯和上下文恰当的文本的卓越性能。我们还进行了详细的人工评估，以深入了解Cheetah的语言能力。Cheetah的引入对语言多样性具有深远的益处。通过利用预训练模型并将其适应特定的非洲语言，我们能够提供更多的语言生成选择和资源。",
