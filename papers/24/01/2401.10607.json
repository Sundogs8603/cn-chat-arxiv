    "abstract": "In the context of content-based recommender systems, the aim of this paper is to determine how better profiles can be built and how these affect the recommendation process based on the incorporation of temporality, i.e. the inclusion of time in the recommendation process, and topicality, i.e. the representation of texts associated with users and items using topics and their combination. The main contribution of the paper is to present two different ways of hybridising these two dimensions and to evaluate and compare them with other alternatives.",
