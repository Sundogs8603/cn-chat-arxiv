    "abstract": "The Model Parameter Randomisation Test (MPRT) is widely acknowledged in the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) community for its well-motivated evaluative principle: that the explanation function should be sensitive to changes in the parameters of the model function. However, recent works have identified several methodological caveats for the empirical interpretation of MPRT. To address these caveats, we introduce two adaptations to the original MPRT -- Smooth MPRT and Efficient MPRT, where the former minimises the impact that noise has on the evaluation results through sampling and the latter circumvents the need for biased similarity measurements by re-interpreting the test through the explanation's rise in complexity, after full parameter randomisation. Our experimental results demonstrate that these proposed variants lead to improved metric reliability, thus enabling a more trustworthy application of XAI methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "在可解释人工智能 (XAI) 社区中，模型参数随机化测试 (MPRT) 凭借其有力的评估原则而广受认可：解释函数应对模型函数参数的变化敏感。然而，最近的研究发现了关于 MPRT 的几个方法论上的注意事项。为了解决这些注意事项，我们引入了两种对原始 MPRT 进行改进的方法——平滑 MPRT 和高效 MPRT，前者通过采样来最小化噪音对评估结果的影响，后者通过在完全参数随机化后解释的复杂度上升来绕过对偏倚相似度测量的需求。我们的实验结果表明，这些提出的变体可以提高度量的可靠性，从而更可信地应用 XAI 方法。",
