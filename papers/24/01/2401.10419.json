    "abstract": "Segmenting organs in CT scan images is a necessary process for multiple downstream medical image analysis tasks. Currently, manual CT scan segmentation by radiologists is prevalent, especially for organs like the pancreas, which requires a high level of domain expertise for reliable segmentation due to factors like small organ size, occlusion, and varying shapes. When resorting to automated pancreas segmentation, these factors translate to limited reliable labeled data to train effective segmentation models. Consequently, the performance of contemporary pancreas segmentation models is still not within acceptable ranges. To improve that, we propose M3BUNet, a fusion of MobileNet and U-Net neural networks, equipped with a novel Mean-Max (MM) attention that operates in two stages to gradually segment pancreas CT images from coarse to fine with mask guidance for object detection. This approach empowers the network to surpass segmentation performance achieved by similar network architecture",

    "translated_abstract": "在CT扫描图像中分割器官是多个下游医学图像分析任务中必要的过程。目前，手动CT扫描分割由放射科医生广泛应用，尤其是对于像胰腺这样的器官，由于器官尺寸小、遮挡和形状变化等因素需要高水平的领域专业知识进行可靠的分割。当转向自动胰腺分割时，这些因素导致可靠标注数据有限，难以训练有效的分割模型。因此，现代胰腺分割模型的性能仍未达到可接受范围。为了改善这一点，我们提出了M3BUNet，它是MobileNet和U-Net神经网络的融合，配备了一种新颖的均值最大(MM)注意力机制，通过两个阶段逐步细分胰腺CT图像，并使用掩码指导进行目标检测。这种方法使网络能够超越类似网络架构所实现的分割性能。",
