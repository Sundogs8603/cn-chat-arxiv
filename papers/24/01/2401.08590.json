    "abstract": "The objective of this research was to analyze the impact of the increase in the price of fuels and its incidence on the products of the basic basket of the El Triunfo, the province of Guayas. In the present study, the non-experimental quantitative method was used. The study population was limited to the families of the town, seeking to determine how their level of consumption was impacted after the increase in fuels. Just 95 people were randomly taken. The study instrument that was used was surveys, with a focus on the purchasing power of families with respect to the basic basket after the increase in fuel prices. The results were processed through Cronbach's Alpha and reflected in pie charts. The independent and dependent variable that make up our study, were related through a simple linear regression, to determine if they correlate with each other.  Keywords: Fuels, Basic basket, Linear regression, Subsidies, Inflation",
