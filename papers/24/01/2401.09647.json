    "translated_abstract": "饮食紊乱作为一种危险的心理健康状况，具有较高的死亡率和发病率，其上升与社交媒体上理想化身体形象的泛滥有关。然而，社交媒体与饮食紊乱之间的联系远不止如此。我们认为社交媒体平台创建了一个反馈循环，放大了推广厌食症和暴食症等饮食紊乱的内容和社群的增长。具体而言，社交媒体平台使易受伤害的个体能够轻松找到并联系到志同道合的其他人，而群体动态过程则鼓励他们在推广和美化与饮食紊乱相关的有害行为的社群中持续参与。我们通过网络和语言分析的组合，从经验上描述了这一动态。我们提出了一个新颖的框架，利用大型语言模型分析在线社群内的话语，并对与饮食紊乱相关的话题的态度进行探测，以鉴别潜在的情况。",
