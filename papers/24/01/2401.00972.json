    "abstract": "Objective: Blood transfusions, crucial in managing anemia and coagulopathy in ICU settings, require accurate prediction for effective resource allocation and patient risk assessment. However, existing clinical decision support systems have primarily targeted a particular patient demographic with unique medical conditions and focused on a single type of blood transfusion. This study aims to develop an advanced machine learning-based model to predict the probability of transfusion necessity over the next 24 hours for a diverse range of non-traumatic ICU patients.  Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 72,072 adult non-traumatic ICU patients admitted to a high-volume US metropolitan academic hospital between 2016 and 2020. We developed a meta-learner and various machine learning models to serve as predictors, training them annually with four-year data and evaluating on the fifth, unseen year, iteratively over five years.  Results: The experimental results revealed that the",
