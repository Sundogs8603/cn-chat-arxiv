    "abstract": "We present StreamVC, a streaming voice conversion solution that preserves the content and prosody of any source speech while matching the voice timbre from any target speech. Unlike previous approaches, StreamVC produces the resulting waveform at low latency from the input signal even on a mobile platform, making it applicable to real-time communication scenarios like calls and video conferencing, and addressing use cases such as voice anonymization in these scenarios. Our design leverages the architecture and training strategy of the SoundStream neural audio codec for lightweight high-quality speech synthesis. We demonstrate the feasibility of learning soft speech units causally, as well as the effectiveness of supplying whitened fundamental frequency information to improve pitch stability without leaking the source timbre information.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了StreamVC，这是一个流式语音转换解决方案，能够保留任何源语音的内容和韵律，同时匹配任何目标语音的音质。与之前的方法不同，StreamVC甚至可以在移动平台上以低延迟从输入信号中生成结果波形，这使其适用于实时通信场景，如电话和视频会议，并解决这些场景下的声音匿名化等用例。我们的设计充分利用了SoundStream神经音频编解码器的架构和训练策略，实现了轻量级高质量的语音合成。我们演示了学习软语音单元的可行性，以及通过提供白化的基频信息来改善音高稳定性而不泄漏源音质信息的有效性。",
