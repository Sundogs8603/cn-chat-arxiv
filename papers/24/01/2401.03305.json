A broker-dealer agency is authorized to execute an order of trading on client's behalf. The strategies that the agent is allowed to deploy is subject to a benchmark, referred to as the reservation strategy, regulated by the client. We formulate the broker's problem as a utility maximization problem in which the broker seeks to maximize his utility of excess profit-and-loss at the execution horizon. Optimal strategy in feedback form is obtained in closed form. In the absence of execution risk, the optimal strategies subject to reservation strategies are deterministic. We establish an affine structure among the trading trajectories under optimal strategies subject to general reservation strategies using implementation shortfall and target close orders as basis. We conclude the paper with numerical experiments illustrating the trading trajector",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在Almgren-Chriss模型下，从经纪商的角度解决元订单执行问题。经纪商代表客户执行交易订单，并根据客户规定的基准策略来部署策略。我们将经纪商的问题形式化为一个效用最大化问题，经纪商试图在执行时间段内最大化其超额盈亏的效用。最优策略以反馈形式得到闭式解。在没有执行风险的情况下，受预留策略约束的最优策略是确定性的。我们使用实施不足和目标市场订单作为基础，建立了最优策略受一般预留策略约束下交易轨迹的仿射结构。最后，通过数值实验说明了交易轨迹的性质。",
