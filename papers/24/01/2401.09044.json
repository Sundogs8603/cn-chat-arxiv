    "translated_abstract": "信息获取过程的演变，由谷歌等搜索引擎驱动，已经改变了人们对信息的获取方式。本文研究了个体先前的态度如何影响现代信息获取过程，特别是谷歌搜索呈现的结果。通过涉及堕胎主题的综合研究，包括调查和信息获取任务，本文提供了四个关键的观点：1）在堕胎问题上持相反态度的个体会收到不同的搜索结果。2）个体通过选择查询时使用的词汇表达自己的信念，从而塑造了搜索结果的结果。3）此外，用户的搜索历史在持相反态度的人群中导致了不同的结果。4）谷歌搜索引擎在搜索结果中强化了先前存在的信念。总的来说，本研究提供了人类偏见和算法过程之间相互作用的见解，突出了对偏见进行干预和调整的重要性。",
