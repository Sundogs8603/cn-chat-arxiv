    "translated_abstract": "学习机器人在行人群体中的导航策略对于基于领域的应用至关重要。结合感知、规划和预测可以模拟机器人和行人之间的互动，尤其是在基于深度强化学习的最近方法中取得了令人印象深刻的成果。然而，这些工作没有考虑多机器人场景。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的方法，使用强化学习来学习多智能体社交感知导航策略。受到近期多智能体深度强化学习研究的启发，我们的方法利用了基于图的表示来描述智能体之间的相互作用，结合了实体的位置和视野。每个智能体使用两个图神经网络模型结合注意机制。首先，边选择器生成稀疏图，然后众包协调器应用节点注意力来生成表示每个实体对其他实体影响的图。这被加入到一个模型中。",
