    "abstract": "Automated fact-checking is a crucial task in the governance of internet content. Although various studies utilize advanced models to tackle this issue, a significant gap persists in addressing complex real-world rumors and deceptive claims. To address this challenge, this paper explores the novel task of flaw-oriented fact-checking, including aspect generation and flaw identification. We also introduce RefuteClaim, a new framework designed specifically for this task. Given the absence of an existing dataset, we present FlawCheck, a dataset created by extracting and transforming insights from expert reviews into relevant aspects and identified flaws.

    "translated_abstract": "自动化事实检验是治理互联网内容的重要任务。尽管各种研究利用先进模型来解决这个问题，但在处理复杂的真实世界传言和欺骗性主张方面仍存在重大差距。为了解决这个挑战，本文探讨了基于缺陷的事实检验的新任务，包括方面生成和缺陷识别。我们还引入了RefuteClaim，一个专为这一任务设计的新框架。鉴于目前不存在合适的数据集，我们提出了FlawCheck，这是一个通过从专家评论中提取和转换见解而创建的数据集，以获取相关方面和已确定的缺陷。实验结果强调了RefuteClaim的有效性，特别是在分类和阐明虚假主张方面。",
