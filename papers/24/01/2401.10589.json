    "translated_abstract": "MaxSAT是著名的NP完全可满足性问题（SAT）的优化版本。MaxSAT算法主要包括完全解算器和局部搜索不完全解算器。在许多完全解算器中，一旦找到更好的解，就会生成一个软冲突伪布尔（SPB）约束，强制算法寻找更好的解。在许多局部搜索算法中，子句加权是一种有效引导搜索方向的关键技术。本文提出将SPB约束转化为局部搜索方法的子句加权系统，使算法能够找到更好的解。我们进一步提出了一种自适应子句加权策略，打破了使用常数值来调整子句权重的传统。基于上述方法，我们提出了一种名为SPB-MaxSAT的新型局部搜索算法，为MaxSAT局部搜索解算器的子句加权提供了新的视角。广泛的实验表明了SPB-MaxSAT算法的优异性能。",
