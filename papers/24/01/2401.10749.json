Nevertheless, existing approaches often suffer from the issue of overconfidence in predicting students' mastery levels, which is primarily caused by the unavoidable noise and sparsity in realistic student-exercise interaction data, severely hindering the educational application of diagnostic feedback. To address this, in this paper, we propose a novel Reliable Cognitive Diagnosis(ReliCD) framework, which can quantify the confidence of the diagnosis feedback and is flexible for different cognitive diagnostic functions.

    "translated_abstract": "在过去几十年中，认知诊断建模吸引了计算教育界的越来越多关注，可以量化学生的学习状况和知识掌握水平。近年来，神经网络的最新进展通过学习学生和练习的深层表示大大提高了传统认知诊断模型的性能。然而，现有方法常常在预测学生掌握水平时存在过于自信的问题，这主要是由现实中学生-练习交互数据中不可避免的噪声和稀疏性引起的，严重阻碍了认知反馈的教育应用。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的可靠性认知诊断框架ReliCD，可以量化诊断反馈的信心，并适应不同的认知诊断功能。",
