    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）在各种任务上展现出令人印象深刻的性能，吸引了越来越多的尝试将LLMs应用于药物发现领域。然而，在药物发现流程中，分子优化是一个关键任务，但目前LLMs在这个领域的参与很少。大多数现有方法仅关注捕捉数据中提供的化学结构的潜在模式，而没有利用专家反馈。这些非交互式方法忽视了药物发现过程实际上需要专家经验和迭代改进的事实。为了填补这个空白，我们提出了DrugAssist，一个通过人机对话利用LLM的强交互性和泛化能力进行分子优化的交互式模型。DrugAssist在单一和多个性质优化方面取得了领先的结果，同时展示了巨大的潜力。",
