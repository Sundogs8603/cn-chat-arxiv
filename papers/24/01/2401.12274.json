    "translated_abstract": "以往的研究表明特许价值假设在理论上是有根据的并且得到了实证支持，但并非普遍适用。因此，本文旨在对特许价值、风险承担和监管之间的关系进行分析，考虑到这些关系的复杂性。具体而言，我们使用CAMELS评级系统作为监管的总体框架，通过分类和回归树分析来研究特许价值与风险、监管之间的关系。样本涵盖了2005年至2016年的期间，包括了欧元区成立时的成员国以及希腊上市银行。为了评估危机后果，我们还分别分析了四个子期间以及需要第三方财务援助和不需要财务援助的国家，以及大型和小型银行。我们的结果反映了特许价值、监管和风险之间关系的复杂性。实际上，监管和特许价值之间的关系存在多样性。",
    "tldr": "这个论文通过分类和回归树分析研究了特许价值、风险和监管之间的关系，结果显示它们之间存在复杂的关联。"
