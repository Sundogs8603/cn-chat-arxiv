    "translated_abstract": "对比分析（CA）处理的是发现目标领域与背景领域相比的共同点和特殊点。这在许多应用中具有极大的兴趣，例如医学成像。目前的最新方法是基于VAE的潜在变量模型（CA-VAEs）。然而，它们要么忽略重要的约束条件，要么没有强制执行基本假设。这可能导致次优解，其中将特殊因素误认为共同因素（或反之亦然）。此外，生成的图像具有VAE的较差质量，降低了其可解释性和实用性。在这里，我们提出了双重InfoGAN，这是第一个基于GAN的CA方法，它充分利用了GAN的高质量合成和InfoGAN的分离能力。在从简单的合成示例到复杂的医学图像的四个视觉数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的方法在潜在分离和图像质量方面优于最新的CA-VAEs。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文提出了双重InfoGAN方法用于对比分析，通过结合GAN的高质量合成和InfoGAN的分离能力，有效地解决了当前基于VAE的方法在处理共同因素和特殊因素时的不足，并在不同的视觉数据集上展现出优越的性能。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes the Double InfoGAN method for contrastive analysis, which effectively addresses the limitations of current VAE-based methods in dealing with common and distinctive factors by combining the high-quality synthesis of GAN and the separation power of InfoGAN. Experimental results on various visual datasets demonstrate its superior performance."
