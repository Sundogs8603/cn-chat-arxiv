    "translated_abstract": "推荐在许多行业中发挥着关键作用，例如电子商务、流媒体、社交媒体等。最近，出现了一种新的推荐场景，称为触发引导推荐（TIR），用户可以通过触发项明确表达他们的即时兴趣，在许多电子商务平台（如阿里巴巴和亚马逊）中起着重要作用。传统的推荐方法通常无法明确建模用户的即时兴趣，因此在TIR中获得次优结果。尽管有一些同时考虑触发项和目标项的方法来解决这个问题，但它们仍未考虑用户行为的时间信息、用户向下滚动时即时兴趣的动态变化以及触发项和目标项之间的交互。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新的方法--深度进化的即时兴趣网络（DEI2N），用于TIR场景中的点击率预测。",
