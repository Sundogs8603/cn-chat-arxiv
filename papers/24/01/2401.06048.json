    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了四种图神经网络架构（GNNs）在使用经典的网络科学生成模型创建的合成数据集上进行图分类任务。由于合成网络不包含（节点或边）特征，因此对节点应用了五种不同的增强策略（人造特征类型）。研究了4种GNNs（具有层次和全局聚合的GCN、GIN和GATv2）和5种特征类型（常数1、噪声、度、归一化度和ID - 各种长度的循环数量的向量）的所有组合，并在GNNs中使用的人工神经网络的隐藏维度作为函数比较其性能。还使用第二个合成网络数据集分析了这些模型的泛化能力（包含不同规模的网络）。我们的结果表明，GNN架构的计算能力和人工特征提供的信息水平的平衡重要性。",
