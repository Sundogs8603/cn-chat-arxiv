    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的方法，将非结构化文本中的联合实体和关系抽取问题作为条件序列生成问题来解决。与传统的生成式信息抽取模型不同，我们的方法是基于跨度的，它生成一个线性化的图，其中节点表示文本跨度，边表示关系三元组。我们的方法采用了一个具有指向机制的转换器编码器-解码器架构，使用一个动态词汇表来表示跨度和关系类型。我们的模型能够通过跨度表示捕捉实体和关系的结构特征和边界，同时通过指向机制将生成的输出与原始文本进行对齐。在基准数据集上的评估验证了我们方法的有效性，展示了竞争性的结果。代码可在https://github.com/urchade/ATG找到。",
