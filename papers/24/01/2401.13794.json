    "abstract": "This paper examines the use of deep recurrent neural networks to classify traffic patterns in smart cities. We propose a novel approach to traffic pattern classification based on deep recurrent neural networks, which can effectively capture traffic patterns' dynamic and sequential features. The proposed model combines convolutional and recurrent layers to extract features from traffic pattern data and a SoftMax layer to classify traffic patterns. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods regarding accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Furthermore, we provide an in depth analysis of the results and discuss the implications of the proposed model for smart cities. The results show that the proposed model can accurately classify traffic patterns in smart cities with a precision of as high as 95%. The proposed model is evaluated on a real world traffic pattern dataset and compared with existing classification methods.",
