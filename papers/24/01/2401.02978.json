    "abstract": "For generative AI to succeed, how engaging a conversationalist must it be? For almost sixty years, some conversational agents have responded to any question or comment to keep a conversation going. In recent years, several utilized machine learning or sophisticated language processing, such as Tay, Xiaoice, Zo, Hugging Face, Kuki, and Replika. Unlike generative AI, they focused on engagement, not expertise. Millions of people were motivated to engage with them. What were the attractions? Will generative AI do better if it is equally engaging, or should it be less engaging? Prior to the emergence of generative AI, we conducted a large-scale quantitative and qualitative analysis to learn what motivated millions of people to engage with one such 'virtual companion,' Microsoft's Zo. We examined the complete chat logs of 2000 anonymized people. We identified over a dozen motivations that people had for interacting with this software. Designers learned different ways to increase engagement. ",

    "translated_abstract": "要使生成式AI成功，它必须具备多么引人入胜的对话能力？近60年来，一些对话代理会回应任何问题或评论以保持对话的进行。近年来，许多人开始利用机器学习或复杂的语言处理技术，例如Tay、Xiaoice、Zo、Hugging Face、Kuki和Replika。与生成式AI不同的是，它们关注的是互动性，而不是专业知识。数百万人被激发起与它们进行互动。那么这些吸引力是什么呢？如果生成式AI同样引人入胜，它会做得更好吗，还是应该减少互动性？在生成式AI出现之前，我们进行了大规模定量和定性分析，以了解数百万人与微软伙伴Zo进行互动的动机。我们研究了2000个匿名用户的完整聊天记录，并确定了数十种人们与该软件进行互动的动机。设计师们学会了不同的方法来提高互动性。",
    "tldr": "这项研究通过分析与虚拟伙伴Zo互动的动机，总结出了多种增加互动性的方法，为生成式AI的发展提供了借鉴。"
