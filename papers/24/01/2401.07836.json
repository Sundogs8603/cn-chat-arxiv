    "translated_abstract": "传统上对人工智能(AI)引起的存在风险(x-risks)的讨论通常集中在由先进的AI系统引起的突然、严重事件上，尤其是那些可能达到或超过人类水平智能的系统。这些事件将带来严重后果，要么导致人类灭绝，要么无法逆转地使人类文明陷入无法恢复的状态。然而，这种讨论经常忽视AI x-risk逐渐通过一系列较小但相互关联的中断逐渐显现出来的严重可能性，随着时间的推移逐渐跨越关键阈值。该论文将传统的“决定性AI x-risk假设”与“累积性AI x-risk假设”进行对比。前者描绘了一种明显的AI接管路径，其特征是无法控制的超级智能等情景，而后者则提出了另一种导致灭绝性灾难的因果路径。这涉及到由AI引起的严重威胁的逐渐累积，例如严重的漏洞和系统性问题",
