However, complex medical concepts and jargon within clinical notes hinder patient comprehension and may lead to anxiety. We developed a patient-facing tool to make clinical notes more readable, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to simplify, extract information from, and add context to notes. We prompt engineered GPT-4 to perform these augmentation tasks on real clinical notes donated by breast cancer survivors and synthetic notes generated by a clinician, a total of 12 notes with 3868 words. In June 2023, 200 female-identifying US-based participants were randomly assigned three clinical notes with varying levels of augmentations using our tool. Participants answered questions about each note, evaluating their understanding of follow-up actions and self-reported confidence. We found that augmentations were ass",

    "translated_abstract": "患者通过阅读他们的临床笔记获得了许多好处，包括增加对自身健康的控制感和对护理计划的理解提高。然而，在临床笔记中复杂的医学概念和术语阻碍了患者的理解，并可能导致焦虑。我们开发了一个面向患者的工具，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）简化笔记、从中提取信息并增加上下文，以使临床笔记更易读。我们使用我们的工具提示改进的GPT-4对由乳腺癌幸存者捐赠的真实临床笔记和临床医生生成的合成临床笔记进行这些增强任务。共有12条笔记，3868个字。2023年6月，我们随机分配了200名美国女性参与者，并向他们分发了三个具有不同程度增强的临床笔记。参与者回答了有关每个笔记的问题，评估了他们对后续行动的理解和自我报告的自信心。我们发现增强对阅读理解和自信心友好。",
