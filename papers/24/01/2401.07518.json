Particularly, NLP has been applied to the education domain to help teaching and learning. In this survey, we review recent advances in NLP with a focus on solving problems related to the education domain. In detail, we begin with introducing the relevant background. Then, we present the taxonomy of NLP in the education domain. Next, we illustrate the task definition, challenges, and corresponding techniques based on the above taxonomy. After that, we showcase some off-the-shelf demonstrations in this domain and conclude with future directions.",
