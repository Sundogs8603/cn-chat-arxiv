    "translated_abstract": "我们使用基于代理的建模作为数值方法，人为地模拟了一个动态的实体经济，其中代理人是柯布-道格拉斯类型目标函数的理性最优化者。该经济的特点是异质代理人、在局部或不完全信息下行动、垄断竞争、完全产品差异化、允许规模报酬递增技术和非均衡贸易。我们设计了每个时期的经济活动算法，并开发了一个通用的开源代理模型，可以进行反事实查询、测试处理方法、分析各种经济过程、结果的因果关系，并研究 emergent properties。我们运行了10,000次模拟，每次有10家公司和80个消费者，并根据不同的参数进行了测试。结果显示，仅从几个初始条件，经济就能达到均衡，而在大多数其他情况下，经济仍处于永久的非均衡状态。",
