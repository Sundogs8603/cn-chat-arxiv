    "translated_abstract": "在印度尼西亚这个世界第四人口大国老龄人口的增长下，养老金业务逐渐兴盛，包括银行业。 PT Bank Jaya Artha是印尼的一家银行，为即将退休的人提供产品和服务。由于养老金业务市场的竞争激烈，从2019年开始，Jaya Artha银行对计划偿还债务的客户实行了罚款制度，罚款金额为尚未偿还债务的5%加上三倍分期付款额，以防止客户转而去竞争对手。虽然此条款不包含在实施前签署的贷款协议中，却也适用于过去的贷款协议，这导致客户的投诉。该研究旨在了解未经同意的条款实施对客户满意度和推荐意愿的影响，以及银行应该采取什么措施来更加以客户为中心。",
