    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了AlphaMapleSAT，一种新颖的基于Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)的Cube-and-Conquer (CnC) SAT求解方法，旨在高效地解决具有挑战性的组合问题。尽管CnC求解器在解决各种困难的组合问题上取得了巨大成功，但多年来，CnC的先行计算技术并没有得到很大发展。其中一个原因是很难提出既低成本又能有效地将输入公式分割为子公式的新型分割技术，从而使整体运行时间最小化。当前最先进的CnC求解器（如March）使用的先行计算技术通过约束搜索最优分割变量来降低计算成本。相比之下，我们的关键创新是一种基于推理驱动的MCTS先行计算技术，通过进行更深入的启发式搜索来寻找有效的分割，同时使计算成本低。我们进行了详细的对比实验",
