Manually identifying instances of cherry-picked statements in news stories can be challenging, particularly when the opposing viewpoint's story is absent. This study introduces Cherry, an innovative approach for automatically detecting cherry-picked statements in news articles by finding missing important statements in the target news story. Cherry utilizes the analysis of news coverage from multiple sources to identify instances of cherry-picking. Our approach relies on language models that consider contextual information from other news sources to classify statements based on their importance to the event covered in the target news story.
