In a FOLTR system, a ranker is learned by aggregating local updates to the global ranking model. Local updates are learned in an online manner at a client-level using queries and implicit interactions that have occurred within that specific client.

    "translated_abstract": "数据保护法规如欧盟的《通用数据保护条例》（GDPR）建立了“被遗忘的权利”：用户（客户）可以要求将使用他们的数据进行的贡献从学习的模型中删除。本文研究了如何删除参与联邦在线学习排序（FOLTR）系统中客户所做的贡献。在FOLTR系统中，通过聚合局部更新到全局排序模型来学习排序器。局部更新是以在线方式在客户级别上使用查询和隐式交互来学习的，这些查询和交互发生在特定客户内部。通过这样做，每个客户的本地数据不会与其他客户或集中式搜索服务共享，同时客户可以从联邦中的每个客户的贡献中受益。在本文中，我们研究了一种有效和高效的取消学习方法，可以删除客户的贡献。",
