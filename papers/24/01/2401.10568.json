    "translated_abstract": "决策代理的泛化包括两个基本元素：从过去经验中学习和在新情境中进行推理。然而，在大多数交互环境中，对学习的重视往往以牺牲推理复杂性为代价。在本文中，我们介绍了CivRealm，一个受到文明游戏启发的环境。文明游戏与人类历史和社会的深刻契合需要复杂的学习，而其不断变化的情境则要求强大的推理能力。特别是，CivRealm建立了一个有着不完全信息和变化人数的总和游戏；它呈现了众多复杂的特征，挑战代理人处理开放的、随机的环境，需要外交和谈判技巧。在CivRealm中，我们为两种典型的代理类型提供了接口：基于张量的学习型代理和基于语言的推理型代理。",
