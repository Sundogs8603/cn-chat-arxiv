    "translated_abstract": "利用不同的空间和时间分辨率感知模式可以提高机器人操作任务的性能。多空间分辨率感知提供了在不同空间尺度上捕获的层次信息，并实现粗粒度和精确动作。同时，多时间分辨率感知使得机器人能够表现出高反应性和实时控制。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个名为MResT（多分辨率Transformer）的框架，用于学习通用的语言条件的多任务策略，利用不同空间和时间分辨率的感知，使用不同容量的网络来有效地执行精确和反应性任务的实时控制。我们利用现成的预训练视觉语言模型来处理低频全局特征，同时使用小型的非预训练模型来适应高频本地反馈。通过在粗粒度、精确和动态操作任务的三个领域进行广泛实验，我们证明了MResT的有效性。",
