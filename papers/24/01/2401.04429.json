    "abstract": "Ride-hailing platforms have been facing the challenge of balancing demand and supply. Existing vehicle reposition techniques often treat drivers as homogeneous agents and relocate them deterministically, assuming compliance with the reposition. In this paper, we consider a more realistic and driver-centric scenario where drivers have unique cruising preferences and can decide whether to take the recommendation or not on their own. We propose i-Rebalance, a personalized vehicle reposition technique with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). i-Rebalance estimates drivers' decisions on accepting reposition recommendations through an on-field user study involving 99 real drivers. To optimize supply-demand balance and enhance preference satisfaction simultaneously, i-Rebalance has a sequential reposition strategy with dual DRL agents: Grid Agent to determine the reposition order of idle vehicles, and Vehicle Agent to provide personalized recommendations to each vehicle in the pre-defined order",

    "translated_abstract": "租车平台面临着供需平衡的挑战。现有的车辆重新定位技术通常将司机视为同质化的代理人，并且以确定性的方式重新定位他们，假设他们会遵守重新定位。在本文中，我们考虑了一个更真实和以驾驶员为中心的场景，其中驾驶员具有独特的巡航偏好，并且可以自行决定是否接受推荐。我们提出了一种使用深度强化学习（DRL）的个性化车辆重新定位技术：i-Rebalance。i-Rebalance通过涉及99名真实驾驶员的现场用户研究来估计驾驶员对重新定位推荐的决策。为了同时优化供需平衡和增强偏好满意度，i-Rebalance采用了顺序重新定位策略，并使用双DRL代理：网格代理确定空闲车辆的重新定位顺序，车辆代理为预定义的顺序中的每辆车提供个性化推荐。",
