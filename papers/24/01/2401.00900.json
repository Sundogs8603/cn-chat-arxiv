In this work, we use the stability of the MPS as a detection metric for recognizing and classifying the presence of clicks in noisy environments. To distinguish between noise transients and to handle simultaneous emissions from multiple sperm whales, our approach clusters a time series of MPS measures while removing potential clicks that do not fulfil the limits of inter-click interval, duration and spectrum. As a result, our approach can handle high noise transients and low signal-to-noise ratio. The performance of our detection approach is examined using three datasets: seven months of recordings from the Mediterranean Sea containing manually verified ambient noise; several days of manually labelled data collected from the Dominica Island containing app",

    "translated_abstract": "折射鲸（Physeter macrocephalus）通过一系列的冲击性、类似点击的声音（称为回声定位点击）在水下导航。这些点击具有多脉冲结构（MPS），可作为一个独特的模式。在这项工作中，我们使用MPS的稳定性作为检测指标，识别和分类嘈杂环境中的点击存在。为了区分噪声瞬变和处理多只折射鲸同时发出的情况，我们的方法通过聚类MPS测量的时间序列来移除不符合间击间隔、持续时间和频谱限制的潜在点击。因此，我们的方法能够处理高噪声瞬变和低信噪比。我们使用三个数据集来检验我们的检测方法的性能：包含经过手工验证的环境噪声的地中海七个月的录音；来自多米尼加岛的经过手工标记的数据，其中包含了几天的记录。",
