    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）在自动完成各种真实世界应用任务方面展现出巨大潜力。然而，这些LLM代理在交互环境中操作时会引入意外的安全风险。与大多数之前的研究集中在LLM生成内容的安全性不同，本研究关注评估LLM代理在不同环境中的行为安全性的迫切需求。我们介绍了一个名为R-Judge的基准测试，用于评估LLM在给定代理交互记录时判断安全风险的能力。R-Judge包括162个代理交互记录，涵盖7个应用领域和10种风险类型的27个关键风险场景。它结合了人类对安全性的共识，并具有标记的安全风险标签和高质量的风险描述。利用R-Judge，我们对8种常用作代理骨干的著名LLM模型进行了全面评估。表现最好的模型GPT-4实现了72.29%的对比结果。",
