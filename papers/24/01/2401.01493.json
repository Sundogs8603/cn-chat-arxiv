Due to location differences, growth in data size, and centralized server storage constraints, these data are usually stored under different databases across regions/countries.

Additionally, low-resource remote sensing devices encounter challenges in terms of communication overhead and efficiency when dealing with the ever-increasing data and model scales.

    "translated_abstract": "遥感目标的细粒度分类对军事和民用领域都具有重要意义。由于位置差异、数据规模增长和集中式服务器存储限制，这些数据通常存储在不同地区/国家的不同数据库中。然而，隐私法律和国家安全问题限制研究人员进一步分析这些敏感的遥感图像。此外，低资源的遥感设备在处理不断增长的数据和模型规模时，也面临通信开销和效率方面的挑战。为了解决上述挑战，本文提出了一种基于联邦学习的新型隐私保护TFGC框架，称为PRFL。所提出的框架允许每个客户端在统计异构（非独立同分布，IID）的环境中学习全局和局部知识，以增强私有数据的本地表示。",
