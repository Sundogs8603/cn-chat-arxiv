    "translated_abstract": "在工业制造中，无监督增量训练的异常检测至关重要，因为不可预测的缺陷使得获取足够的标记数据变得不可行。然而，当前的连续学习方法主要依赖于有监督的注释，而在无监督异常检测中的应用受限于缺乏监督。目前的无监督异常检测方法是针对不同类别依次训练独立的模型，导致灾难性遗忘和计算负担沉重。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一种新颖的无监督连续异常检测框架UCAD，通过对比学习提示为UAD提供了连续学习能力。在提出的UCAD中，我们通过利用简洁的关键提示知识库设计了连续提示模块(CPM)，通过使用任务特定的“正常”知识指导任务无关的“异常”模型预测。此外，我们还设计了基于结构的对比学习(SCL)，并采用Segment Anything Model (SAM)。",
