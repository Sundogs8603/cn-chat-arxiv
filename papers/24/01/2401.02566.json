To simplify the otherwise time- and cost-intensive musical shape evaluation, in this paper we explore how artificial intelligence (AI) driven models can be applied. Considering musical shape evaluation as a classification problem, a light-weight Siamese residual neural network (S-ResNN) is proposed to automatically identify musical shapes. To assess the proposed approach in the context of piano musical shape evaluation, we have generated a new dataset, containing 4116 music pieces derived by 147 piano preparatory exercises and performed in 28 categories of musical shapes. The experimental results show that the S-ResNN significantly outperforms a number of benchmark methods in terms of the precision, recall and F1 score.",
