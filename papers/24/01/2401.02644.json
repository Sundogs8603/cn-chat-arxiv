    "translated_abstract": "基于扩散的生成方法在建模离线数据集中的轨迹方面已被证明是有效的。然而，它们常常面临计算挑战，并且在泛化能力方面可能不足，特别是在捕捉长时任务的时间抽象方面。为了克服这个问题，我们引入了分层扩散规划，这是一种简单、快速、但令人惊讶地有效的规划方法，结合了分层和基于扩散的规划的优点。我们的模型在较高层面上采用了“跳跃”规划策略，使其具有较大的感受野但计算成本较低 - 这对于基于扩散的规划方法来说是一个关键因素，我们已经经验性地验证了这一点。此外，跳跃的子目标指导我们的低层规划器，促进了一个微调阶段，并进一步提高了我们方法的效果。我们对标准离线强化学习基准进行了经验评估，展示了我们方法在性能和效率方面的优越表现。",
