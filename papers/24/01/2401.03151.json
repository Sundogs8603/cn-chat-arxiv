    "translated_abstract": "日志异常检测在保障现代软件系统的安全性和维护方面起着关键作用。目前，检测日志数据中的异常的主要方法是通过监督式异常检测。然而，现有的监督式方法往往依赖于有标记的数据，在实际情况下往往受到限制。本文提出了一种半监督的日志异常检测方法，结合深度强化学习中的DQN算法，称为DQNLog。DQNLog利用少量有标记的数据和大规模无标记的数据集，有效解决了数据不平衡和标记数量有限的问题。该方法不仅通过与偏向于异常的环境进行交互来学习已知的异常，还通过主动探索无标记的数据集来发现未知的异常。此外，DQNLog还引入了交叉熵损失项，防止在深度强化学习中出现模型过高估计的情况。",
