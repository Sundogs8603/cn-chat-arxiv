    "translated_abstract": "碳社会成本(SCC)作为衡量气候变化经济影响的简洁指标，常常以全球和国家层面报告。 SCC值在较不发达且人口众多的国家中举足轻重。评估城市和非城市区域对SCC的贡献可以为气候政策提供额外的见解。城市对于定义全球排放、影响升温水平和相关损害至关重要。高度暴露和同时存在的社会与环境问题加剧了城市对气候变化风险的影响。利用空间明确的综合评估模型，将SCC估计为每吨二氧化碳137美元至579美元，在包含城市热岛(UHI)升温时上升至262美元至1075美元。城市SCC占主导地位，城市暴露和UHI都有重要贡献。在城市区域永久降低1%的UHI将为每个城市居民带来净现值为484美元至1562美元的效益。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了城市和非城市对碳社会成本的贡献，并发现城市对碳社会成本的贡献占主导地位，城市暴露和城市热岛效应是主要影响因素，减少城市热岛效应可以带来巨大的经济利益。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper examines the contributions of urban and non-urban areas to the social cost of carbon and finds that urban areas dominate in contributing to the social cost of carbon, with urban exposure and urban heat island effect being the main factors. Reducing urban heat island effect can lead to significant economic benefits."
