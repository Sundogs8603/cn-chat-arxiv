    "translated_abstract": "在杂乱环境中行走的四足机器人必须既敏捷以提高任务执行效率，又要确保安全，避免与障碍物或人碰撞。现有的研究要么开发保守的控制器（速度小于1.0 m/s）以确保安全，要么专注于敏捷性而未考虑潜在致命的碰撞。本文介绍了敏捷但安全（ABS）的学习控制框架，为四足机器人实现了敏捷且无碰撞的行走。ABS包括一个敏捷策略来在障碍物中执行灵活的动作技能，并且有一个恢复策略来避免失败，共同实现高速且无碰撞的导航。ABS中的策略切换由一个学习得到的控制论到达-避免值网络控制，该网络也指导恢复策略作为目标函数，从而在闭环中保护机器人。训练过程涉及敏捷策略、到达-避免值网络、恢复策略和外感知表征的学习。",
