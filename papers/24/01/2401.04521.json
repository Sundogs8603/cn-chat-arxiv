    "translated_abstract": "Proof of Efficient Liquidity (PoEL)协议是为专门采用内置DeFi应用的基于Proof of Stake (PoS)共识的区块链基础设施设计的，旨在支持可持续的流动性引导和网络安全。这种创新的机制通过风险结构引擎和激励分配策略，有效利用预算化的权益奖励来吸引和维持流动性，从而实现了资本效率的最大化。该协议旨在实现两个目标：（i）通过有效吸引风险资本并最大限度地提高其在内置DeFi应用中的运营效用来创造资本，从而确保可持续性；（ii）通过在PoS机制中增加一个协同层，吸引多样化的数字资产，从而增强采用的区块链网络的经济安全性。最后，在附录中，我们还试图将这一金融激励协议推广到...",
