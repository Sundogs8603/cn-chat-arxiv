    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了图像水印技术的弱点。我们提出了一种新颖的基准测试方法WAVES（通过增强的压力测试进行水印分析），用于评估水印的鲁棒性，克服了现有评估方法的局限性。WAVES整合了检测和识别任务，并建立了一个由多样化压力测试组成的标准化评估协议。WAVES中的攻击范围从传统的图像失真到扩散和对抗攻击的高级和新颖变体。我们的评估考察了两个关键维度：图像质量降低程度和攻击后水印检测的有效性。我们开发了一系列性能与质量2D图，变化基于几种突出的图像相似度度量，然后用一种启发式的新颖方法将它们聚合，从而为水印的鲁棒性和攻击能力提供一个全面的画面。我们的综合评估揭示了以前未被发现的脆弱性。",
