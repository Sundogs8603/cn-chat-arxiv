    "abstract": "The field of antibody-based therapeutics has grown significantly in recent years, with targeted antibodies emerging as a potentially effective approach to personalized therapies. Such therapies could be particularly beneficial for complex, highly individual diseases such as cancer. However, progress in this field is often constrained by the extensive search space of amino acid sequences that form the foundation of antibody design. In this study, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning method specifically tailored to address the unique challenges of this domain. We demonstrate that our method can learn the design of high-affinity antibodies against multiple targets in silico, utilizing either online interaction or offline datasets. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first of its kind and outperforms existing methods on all tested antigens in the Absolut! database.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，抗体类治疗领域得到了显著的发展，有针对性的抗体被认为是个性化治疗的一种潜在有效方法。对于复杂、高度个体化的疾病如癌症，这样的治疗可能特别有益。然而，抗体设计的基础氨基酸序列的广泛搜索空间常常限制了该领域的进展。在本研究中，我们引入了一种新颖的强化学习方法，专门解决这一领域的独特挑战。我们证明，我们的方法可以在计算机模拟中学习设计针对多个靶标的高亲和力抗体，无论是通过在线交互还是离线数据集。据我们所知，我们的方法是首个在Absolut!数据库中对所有测试抗原表现优越的方法。",
