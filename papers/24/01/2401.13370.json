    "abstract": "In health econometric studies we are often interested in quantifying aspects related to the accessibility to medical infrastructures. The increasing availability of data automatically collected through unconventional sources (such as webscraping, crowdsourcing or internet of things) recently opened previously unconceivable opportunities to researchers interested in measuring accessibility and to use it as a tool for real-time monitoring, surveillance and health policies definition. This paper contributes to this strand of literature proposing new accessibility measures that can be continuously feeded by automatic data collection. We present new measures of accessibility and we illustrate their use to study the territorial impact of supply-side shocks of health facilities. We also illustrate the potential of our proposal with a case study based on a huge set of data (related to the Emergency Departments in Milan, Italy) that have been webscraped for the purpose of this paper every 5 min",

    "translated_abstract": "在健康计量经济学研究中，我们常常关注与医疗基础设施可及性相关的方面的量化。通过非传统数据源（如网络爬虫、众包或物联网）自动采集的数据的不断增加，为对可及性进行测量并将其用作实时监测、监视和健康政策制定工具的研究人员提供了以前难以想象的机会。本文通过提出能够通过自动数据收集不断更新的新可及性度量，为这一文献领域做出了贡献。我们提出了新的可及性度量，并且通过研究供应端冲击对健康设施的区域影响来展示其应用。我们还通过一个基于米兰（意大利）急诊科的大量数据的案例研究来展示我们的提议的潜力，这些数据每5分钟被网络爬虫爬取。",
