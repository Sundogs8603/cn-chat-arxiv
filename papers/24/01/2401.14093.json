    "abstract": "Due to the continuous change in operational data, AIOps solutions suffer from performance degradation over time. Although periodic retraining is the state-of-the-art technique to preserve the failure prediction AIOps models' performance over time, this technique requires a considerable amount of labeled data to retrain. In AIOps obtaining label data is expensive since it requires the availability of domain experts to intensively annotate it. In this paper, we present McUDI, a model-centric unsupervised degradation indicator that is capable of detecting the exact moment the AIOps model requires retraining as a result of changes in data. We further show how employing McUDI in the maintenance pipeline of AIOps solutions can reduce the number of samples that require annotations with 30k for job failure prediction and 260k for disk failure prediction while achieving similar performance with periodic retraining.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于运行数据不断变化，AIOps解决方案的性能会随时间下降。虽然周期性重训练是保持故障预测AIOps模型性能的最新技术，但该技术需要大量标记数据进行重新训练。在AIOps中获取标记数据是昂贵的，因为它需要领域专家的支持进行密集的注释。本文提出了一种模型中心的无监督退化指示器McUDI，它能够检测到AIOps模型由于数据变化而需要重新训练的确切时刻。我们进一步展示了如何在AIOps解决方案的维护流程中应用McUDI，可以在保持周期性重训练的类似性能的情况下，减少需要进行注释的样本数：对于作业故障预测需要30k个样本，对于磁盘故障预测需要260k个样本。",
