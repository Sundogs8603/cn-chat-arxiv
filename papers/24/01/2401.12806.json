    "translated_abstract": "物理信息神经网络(PINNs)，基于深度学习，已成为解决偏微分方程(PDEs)的一种有前途的方法。通过将PDEs描述的物理信息嵌入前馈神经网络中，PINNs被训练为替代模型，以近似解决方案而无需标签数据。然而，尽管PINNs表现出了卓越的性能，但它们在处理具有快速变化解的方程时可能会遇到困难。这些困难包括收敛速度慢、易陷入局部最小值和解决精度降低。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种二进制结构的物理信息神经网络(BsPINN)框架，该框架使用二进制结构的神经网络(BsNN)作为神经网络组件。通过利用二进制结构，BsPINNs在捕捉局部特征方面表现出色",
