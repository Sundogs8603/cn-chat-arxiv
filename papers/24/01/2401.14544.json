    "translated_abstract": "贝叶斯优化已成为一种有效优化昂贵评估函数的主要策略。现有的贝叶斯优化方法主要依赖于高斯过程替代模型，并不适用于（双随机）高斯Cox过程，其中观测过程由作为高斯过程模型的潜在强度函数调制。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的最大后验推断高斯Cox过程的方法。它利用拉普拉斯近似和核函数变换技术，将问题转化为一个新的再生核希尔伯特空间，在这个空间中计算更容易处理。这使我们能够获得潜在强度函数的函数后验和后验的协方差，从而扩展了现有工作通常关注特定的连接函数或估计后验均值的问题。利用这个结果，我们提出了一个基于高斯Cox过程模型的贝叶斯优化框架，并进一步发展了Nystrom近似。",
