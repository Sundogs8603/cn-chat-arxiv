We introduce the spherical convolutional Wasserstein distance to more comprehensively measure differences between climate models and reanalysis data. This new similarity measure accounts for spatial variability using convolutional projections and quantifies local differences in the distribution of climate variables. We apply this method to evaluate the historical model outputs of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) members by comparing them to observational and reanalysis data products. Additionally, we investigate the progression from CMIP phase 5 to phase 6 and find modest improvements in the phase 6 models regarding their ability to produce realistic climatologies.",
