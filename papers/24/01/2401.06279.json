    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们通过利用图谱和图极限的理论，研究了大规模图谱族上采样集的特性。为此，我们将“可移除集合”和“唯一性集合”的概念扩展到了图谱信号领域，这些概念最初是用于分析图谱上的信号的。我们给出了$\\Lambda-$可移除集合的正式定义，并在得到从图谱中一个给定$\\Lambda-$可移除集合的补集中的样本时，给出了一个频带有限的图谱信号可以以唯一方式表示的条件。通过利用这些结果，我们证明了图谱表示法可以作为一种共同的框架来比较具有不同节点数和边数以及不同节点标记的图谱之间的采样集。此外，对于收敛到一个图谱的图序列，我们还证明了具有相同$[0,1]$中图谱表示的采样集序列也是收敛的。我们利用这种收敛性。",
