    "translated_abstract": "组合化泛化，即通过在较简单的句子上进行训练来预测复杂的含义，对于强大的预训练序列到序列模型来说是一个挑战。本文展示了通过采样MR并进行反向翻译的数据增强方法可以对组合泛化产生有效的效果，但仅当我们从正确的分布中进行采样时才是如此。值得注意的是，从均匀分布中进行采样的效果几乎与从测试分布中进行采样相当，并且比之前从训练分布中采样的方法效果更好。我们进一步进行实验来探究为何会出现这种情况以及这类数据增强方法的好处来自何处。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper demonstrates that data augmentation methods involving sampling of MRs and backtranslation can significantly enhance the performance of compositional generalization, particularly when sampling from the right distribution. Notably, sampling from a uniform distribution yields almost comparable results to sampling from the test distribution, and outperforms previous methods of sampling from the training distribution. Further experiments reveal the reasons behind this phenomenon and the benefits of such data augmentation methods."
