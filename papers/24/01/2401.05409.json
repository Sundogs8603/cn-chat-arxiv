    "abstract": "Alternative data representations are powerful tools that augment the performance of downstream models. However, there is an abundance of such representations within the machine learning toolbox, and the field lacks a comparative understanding of the suitability of each representation method.  In this paper, we propose artifact detection and classification within EEG data as a testbed for profiling image-based data representations of time series data. We then evaluate eleven popular deep learning architectures on each of six commonly-used representation methods.  We find that, while the choice of representation entails a choice within the tradeoff between bias and variance, certain representations are practically more effective in highlighting features which increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the data. We present our results on EEG data, and open-source our testing framework to enable future comparative analyses in this vein.",

    "translated_abstract": "替代数据表示是增强下游模型性能的强大工具。然而，在机器学习工具箱中存在大量这样的表示方法，领域内缺乏对每种表示方法的适用性的比较理解。在本文中，我们将脑电图数据中的伪迹检测和分类作为测试平台，评估了六种常用表示方法上的十一个流行深度学习架构。我们发现，虽然表示的选择涉及偏差和方差之间的权衡，但某些表示在突出数据的信噪比方面实际上更有效。我们展示了针对脑电图数据的结果，并开源了我们的测试框架，以便未来进行这种方法的比较分析。",
