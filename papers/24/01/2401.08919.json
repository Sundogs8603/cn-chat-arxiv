Efforts have so far focused on marking every eligible character (Full Diacritization). Comparatively overlooked, Partial Diacritzation (PD) is the selection of a subset of characters to be marked to aid comprehension where needed. Research has indicated that excessive diacritic marks can hinder skilled readers--reducing reading speed and accuracy. We conduct a behavioral experiment and show that partially marked text is often easier to read than fully marked text, and sometimes easier than plain text. In this light, we introduce Context-Contrastive Partial Diacritization (CCPD)--a novel approach to PD which integrates seamlessly with existing Arabic diacritization systems. CCPD processes each word twice, once with context and once without, and diacritizes only the characters with disparities between the two inferences.

    "translated_abstract": "音标化在提高阿拉伯文本可读性和消除歧义方面起着关键作用。目前的努力主要集中在标记每个符合条件的字符（全音标化）。相比之下，部分音标化（PD）是选择标记子集以在必要时提供帮助。研究表明，过多的音标符号会妨碍熟练读者，降低阅读速度和准确性。我们进行了一项行为实验，并显示出部分标记的文本通常比完全标记的文本更容易阅读，有时甚至比纯文本更容易。在这种情况下，我们介绍了上下文对比的部分音标化（CCPD）-一种与现有阿拉伯音标化系统无缝集成的新方法。CCPD对每个单词进行两次处理，一次有上下文，一次没有，并且只对两次推理之间存在差异的字符进行音标化。此外，我们还引入了衡量部分音标化的新指标。",
