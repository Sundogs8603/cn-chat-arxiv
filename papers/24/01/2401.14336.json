    "translated_abstract": "细粒度车辆识别（FGVR）是智能交通系统中的基础技术，但由于内在的类内变化非常困难。之前的FGVR研究大多只关注由不同拍摄角度、位置等引起的类内变化，而由图像噪声引起的类内变化很少受到关注。本文提出了一种渐进多任务抗噪声学习（PMAL）框架和渐进多任务提取（PMD）框架，用于解决由于图像噪声引起的FGVR中的类内变化问题。PMAL框架通过将图像去噪视为图像识别中的附加任务，并逐步强制模型学习噪声不变性，从而实现高识别准确性。PMD框架将PMAL训练过的模型的知识转移到原始骨干网络中，产生一个具有与PMAL训练模型相同识别准确性的模型，但不需要额外添加任何东西。",
