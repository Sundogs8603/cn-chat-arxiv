    "translated_abstract": "跨领域序列推荐（CDSR）通过在不同粒度（从序列间到序列内，从单领域到跨领域）上集成和学习来自多个领域的交互信息，将用户偏好建模从平面转向了立体。本综述文章中，我们首先使用四维张量定义了CDSR问题，并分析了其在多维度降维下的多类型输入表示。接下来，我们从整体和细节两个视角提供了系统的概述。从整体视角，我们总结了各个模型在不同领域间的多层融合结构，并讨论了它们的融合桥梁。从细节视角，我们着重讨论了现有模型的基础技术，并解释了辅助学习技术。最后，我们展示了可用的公开数据集和代表性的实验结果，并提供了对未来发展的一些见解。",

This survey provides a systematic overview from macro and micro perspectives, summarizing the multi-level fusion structures and bridges for fusion across domains, and discussing the basic and auxiliary learning technologies of existing models. It also showcases available datasets, experimental results, and offers insights into future developments."
