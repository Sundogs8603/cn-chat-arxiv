    "translated_abstract": "最近的流行病凸显了在医院环境中准确诊断COVID-19的重要性。在这方面的一个主要挑战是基于胸部X光片将COVID-19与其他呼吸道疾病区分开来，这还受HIPAA合规限制的限制，这些限制限制了对患者X光片的比较。本文介绍了一种符合HIPAA合规的模型，用于协助诊断COVID-19，利用了联邦学习。联邦学习是一种分布式机器学习方法，允许在多个分散设备上使用本地数据样本进行算法训练，无需数据共享。我们的模型在胸部X光诊断模型方面取得了进展。我们调查了该领域的知名竞赛中的领先模型，并开发了适用于特定医院数据的自己的模型。考虑到模型在联邦学习环境中的运作，我们探讨了偏倚数据更新对模型性能的潜在影响。",
