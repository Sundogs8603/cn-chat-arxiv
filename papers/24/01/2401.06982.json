    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统通常面临着具有噪声的隐式反馈问题。大多数研究从数据清洗的角度缓解噪声问题，如数据重新采样和重新加权，但它们受到启发式假设的限制。另一种去噪方法是从模型的角度，积极地向用户-项目交互中注入噪声，并增强模型的内在去噪能力。然而，这种去噪过程对推荐模型的表示能力来捕捉噪声模式提出了显著挑战。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了去噪扩散推荐模型（DDRM），它基于扩散模型使用多步去噪过程来增强来自任何推荐模型的用户和项目嵌入的鲁棒性。DDRM在前向过程中注入受控高斯噪声，并在反向去噪过程中迭代地去除噪声，从而提高对噪声反馈的嵌入鲁棒性。为了实现这一目标，关键在于提供一种能够捕捉噪声模式的扩散模型，并通过多步去噪过程来改善嵌入。",
