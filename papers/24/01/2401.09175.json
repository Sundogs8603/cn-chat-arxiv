    "abstract": "Question Answering (QA) is increasingly used by search engines to provide results to their end-users, yet very few websites currently use QA technologies for their search functionality. To illustrate the potential of QA technologies for the website search practitioner, we demonstrate web searches that combine QA over knowledge graphs and QA over free text -- each being usually tackled separately. We also discuss the different benefits and drawbacks of both approaches for web site searches. We use the case studies made of websites hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation (namely Wikipedia and Wikidata). Differently from a search engine (e.g. Google, Bing, etc), the data are indexed integrally, i.e. we do not index only a subset, and they are indexed exclusively, i.e. we index only data available on the corresponding website.",

    "translated_abstract": "问答（QA）越来越被搜索引擎用于为用户提供结果，然而目前很少有网站使用QA技术进行搜索功能。为了展示QA技术在网站搜索中的潜力，我们演示了结合知识图谱QA和自由文本QA的网络搜索，这些通常分别进行。我们还讨论了两种方法在网站搜索中的不同优缺点。我们使用由维基媒体基金会托管的网站案例研究（即维基百科和维基数据）。与搜索引擎（如谷歌，必应等）不同，数据被完整索引，即我们不仅索引子集，而且它们的索引是专属的，即我们仅索引相应网站上可用的数据。",
