    "abstract": "Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is an orthopedic emergency, caused by elevated pressure within a muscle compartment, that leads to permanent tissue damage and eventually death. Diagnosis of ACS relies heavily on patient-reported symptoms, a method that is clinically unreliable and often supplemented with invasive intracompartmental pressure measurements. This study proposes a continuous, objective, noninvasive diagnostic for ACS. The device detects ACS through a random forest machine learning model that uses pressure readings from force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) placed on the skin. The final diagnosis is exported real-time to a web application via Bluetooth. To validate the diagnostic, a data set containing FSR measurements and the corresponding simulated intracompartmental pressure was created. The diagnostic achieved an accuracy, on par to the invasive gold standard, of 97%. The device excelled in key performance metrics including precision, sensitivity, and F1 score. Manufactured ",

    "translated_abstract": "急性间室综合征（ACS）是一种骨科急症，由肌肉间室内的压力升高引起，导致永久组织损伤并最终致死。ACS的诊断主要依赖患者报告的症状，这种方法在临床上不可靠，通常需要通过侵入性肌肉间室压力测量进行补充。本研究提出了一种连续、客观、非侵入性的ACS诊断方法。该设备通过一个使用贴在皮肤上的压力传感电阻器（FSR）的随机森林机器学习模型检测ACS。最终诊断结果通过蓝牙以实时方式传输到Web应用程序。为了验证诊断结果，创建了一组包含FSR测量和相应的模拟肌肉间室压力的数据集。该诊断方法的准确率达到97%，与侵入性的金标准持平。该设备在关键性能指标包括准确度、灵敏度和F1得分方面表现优异。",
