    "translated_abstract": "地磁暴是指太阳风扰动地球磁层所引起的现象。地磁暴可能对卫星、电网和通信基础设施造成严重损害。美国每天大规模地磁暴的经济影响超过400亿美元。早期预测对于预防和减轻灾害至关重要。然而，目前的方法要么只能提前几小时预测但无法识别所有类型的地磁暴，要么只能在地磁暴发生前的短时间内进行预测，例如提前一小时。本研究旨在利用大数据和机器学习算法可靠地尽早预测所有类型的地磁暴。通过融合全球多个地面站收集的关于太阳测量的不同方面的大量数据，并使用带有特征选择和数据降采样的随机森林回归方法对较小的地磁暴实例进行处理（这些实例占据了大多数数据），我们在2021年收集的数据上实现了82.55%的准确度。",
