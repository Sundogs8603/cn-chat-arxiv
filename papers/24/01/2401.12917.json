    "translated_abstract": "除了奖励最大化之外，是否有一种规范的方式来思考机构？在本文中，我们展示了任何符合关于宏观生物体如何与世界互动的物理合理假设的行为都以最小化风险和对世界状态的不确定性的意义上，规范地整合了探索与开发。这种描述被称为主动推断，它精细化了自由能原理，这是神经科学中行动和知觉的一个流行的描述性框架。主动推断提供了一种规范性的贝叶斯框架，用于模拟和建模机构，广泛应用于行为神经科学、强化学习和机器人技术领域。主动推断在强化学习领域的用处有三个方面。a) 主动推断提供了一个能够有效模拟生物机构的问题的解决方案。b) 它提供了一个可解释的配方来模拟行为，行为随之成为一个可解释的结果。",
