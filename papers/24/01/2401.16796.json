    "translated_abstract": "基于电子健康记录（EHR）分析患者的健康状况是医学信息学中的一个基本研究问题。EHR中存在大量缺失值，这使得深度神经网络难以直接基于EHR模型化患者的健康状况。现有的深度学习训练协议需要使用统计信息或插补模型来重构缺失值，然而，这些协议会将非现实的数据注入到下游EHR分析模型中，极大地限制了模型的性能。本文介绍了一种新的训练协议——可学习提示作为伪插补（PAI）。PAI不再引入任何插补数据，而是构建一个可学习的提示来模拟下游模型对缺失值的隐含偏好，从而显著提高了所有EHR分析模型的性能。此外，我们的实验结果表明，在数据不足和高噪声的情况下，PAI表现出更高的鲁棒性。",
