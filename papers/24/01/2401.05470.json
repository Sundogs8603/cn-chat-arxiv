    "translated_abstract": "后2020年的全球生物多样性框架需要有雄心勃勃的、以研究为基础的目标。估计由于气候变化导致的加速灭绝风险至关重要。国际自然保护联盟(IUCN)衡量物种的灭绝风险。已经开发出了自动的方法来提供对未评估种群的IUCN状态的信息。然而，这些修正方法基于当前物种特征，主要是地理特征，这使得它们无法在未来的预测中使用。在这里，我们评估了一种新的方法，利用基于深度学习的物种分布模型的泛化能力，对IUCN物种状态进行分类。我们的方法在依赖于捕捉物种环境偏好的灵活SDM特征的同时，达到了最先进的分类性能。交叉验证得出了0.61的状态分类准确度和0.78的二元分类准确度的平均值。气候变化将重塑未来的物种分布。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种利用深度学习建模物种分布的方法，以预测植物灭绝风险和评估气候变化的影响。通过这种方法，可以对物种的IUCN状态进行准确的分类，为全球生物多样性框架的制定提供科学依据。",
