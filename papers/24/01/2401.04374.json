    "translated_abstract": "鉴于深度神经网络（DNN）的复杂性和透明度不足，人们进行了大量努力，以使这些系统更具解释性或在可访问的术语中解释其行为。与大多数评论不同，该工作采用“数据为中心”的观点，研究数据收集，处理和分析如何促成可解释的人工智能（XAI）。我们将现有工作分为三类，根据其目的进行分类：深度模型的解释，涉及将数据点与模型输出相关联的特征归因和推理过程；训练数据的影响，研究训练数据细微差异（如数据评估和样本异常）对决策过程的影响；以及领域知识的见解，从数据和模型中发现潜在模式，并促进社会价值和科学发现的新知识。具体而言，我们将XAI方法论提炼为数据挖掘操作。",
