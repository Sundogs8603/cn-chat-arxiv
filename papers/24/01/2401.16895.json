    "translated_abstract": "尽管多语言语言模型在未见过的语言上表现出令人印象深刻的跨语言转移能力，但在与多语言模型的预训练数据中使用的语言存在文字差异时，其在下游任务中的性能受到影响。使用音译提供了一种直接而有效的方法，可以将资源丰富的语言的文字与目标语言的文字对齐，从而增强跨语言转移能力。然而，对于混合语言来说，这种方法并不是最佳选择，因为只有语言的某个子集从跨语言转移中受益，而其余部分受到阻碍。在这项工作中，我们专注于马耳他语，这是一种受到阿拉伯语、意大利语和英语重大影响，并且采用拉丁文脚本的闪米特语言。我们提供了一个新的数据集，其中包含了单词级别的词源学注释。我们使用这个数据集训练了一个分类器，使我们能够明智决策如何处理马耳他语的每个标记。",
