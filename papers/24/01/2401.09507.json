    "translated_abstract": "在电子商务广告场景中，估计CTR和CVR的真实概率（称为校准估计）是至关重要的，直接影响买方、卖方和平台的利益。先前的研究已经提出了许多解决校准问题的方法。这些方法通常涉及使用验证集训练校准器，并随后在在线推断过程中应用这些校准器来修正原始估计值。然而，电子商务广告场景的挑战在于多场校准。多场校准可以分为两个不同的子问题：数值校准和形状校准。数值校准被定义为每个关注领域下每个数值的不过度或不低估。形状校准被定义为在关注领域条件下特定范围内每个pCTR子集的不过度或不低估。为了实现形状校准和数值校准，我们提出了一种深度集成形状校准的方法。",
