    "translated_abstract": "天文观测通常提供三维地图，编码了观测流量在(1)天球的两个角度和(2)能量/频率上的分布。关于这种地图的一个重要任务是统计地表征那些太暗以至于无法个别检测到的点源的种群。由于对单个光弱源的性质了解有限，通常我们会将整个种群作为一个整体进行研究，推断出一个源数分布 (SCD)，该分布描述了源的数密度随亮度变化的情况。虽然存在用于恢复 SCD 的统计和机器学习方法，但它们通常完全忽略了与流量能谱相关的光谱信息。我们提出了一种深度学习框架，能够同时重构不同发射成分的光谱和点源种群的SCD。在一个概念验证的例子中，我们展示了我们的方法能准确提取复杂形状的源。",
