    "abstract": "This paper develops an econometric model of flight delays to investigate the influence of competition and dominance on the incentives of carriers to maintain on-time performance. We consider both the route and the airport levels to inspect the local and global effects of competition, with a unifying framework to test the hypotheses of 1. airport congestion internalization and 2. the market competition-quality relationship in a single econometric model. In particular, we examine the impacts of the entry of low cost carriers (LCC) on the flight delays of incumbent full service carriers in the Brazilian airline industry. The main results indicate a highly significant effect of airport congestion self-internalization in parallel with route-level quality competition. Additionally, the potential competition caused by LCC presence provokes a global effect that suggests the existence of non-price spillovers of the LCC entry to non-entered routes.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文建立了一个计量模型来研究竞争和主导地位对航空公司保持准时表现的激励影响。我们考虑了航线和机场两个层次，检查了竞争的局部和全局效应，并利用一个统一框架来测试1.机场拥堵内部化和2.市场竞争-质量关系的假设。具体来说，我们研究了廉价航空公司（LCC）进入巴西航空业对现有全服务航空公司航班延误的影响。主要结果表明，机场拥堵自我内部化的影响非常显著，与航线质量竞争并存。此外，LCC存在的潜在竞争引发了全局效应，表明LCC进入对未进入的航线存在非价格溢出效应。",
