This paper provides a systematic approach to enumerating them for a quantitative spatial model with discrete locations, social interactions, and elastic housing supply. The approach relies on two homotopies. A homotopy is a smooth function that transforms the solutions of a simpler city where solutions are known, to a city with heterogeneous locations and finite supply elasticity. The first homotopy is that, in the set of cities with perfectly elastic floor surface supply, an economy with heterogeneous locations is homotopic to an economy with homogeneous locations, whose solutions can be comprehensively enumerated. Such an economy is epsilon close to an economy whose equilibria are the zeros of a system of polynomials. This is a well-studied area of mathematics where the enumeration of equilibria can be guaranteed. The second homotopy is that a city with perfectly elastic housing supply is h",

    "translated_abstract": "具有社会互动或溢出效应的离散选择模型可能表现出多个平衡。本文提供了一种系统的方法来枚举具有离散地点、社会互动和弹性住房供应的定量空间模型的平衡。该方法依赖于两个同伦。同伦是一个平滑函数，它将一个已知解的简单城市转化为具有异质地点和有限供应弹性的城市。第一个同伦是，在具有完全弹性地板表面供应的城市集合中，具有异质地点的经济同伦于具有均匀地点的经济，其解可以全面枚举。这样的经济与一个多项式系统的零点经济接近。这是一个已经研究得很好的数学领域，可以保证平衡的枚举。第二个同伦是，在具有完全弹性住房供应的城市中，将该城市同伦到一个具有有限供应弹性的城市。",
