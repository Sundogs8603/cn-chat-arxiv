    "translated_abstract": "异构图神经网络（HGNN）在网络和电子商务等领域的性能越来越受到认可，对抗攻击的韧性对于这些领域至关重要。然而，现有的对抗攻击方法主要针对同质图设计，应用于HGNN时，由于其对HGNN结构和语义复杂性的限制，这些方法效果不佳。本文介绍了HGAttack，这是一种针对异构图的第一种专用灰盒逃避攻击方法。我们设计了一个新的拟合模型，以与目标HGNN的行为紧密相似，并利用基于梯度的方法生成扰动。具体来说，所提出的拟合模型通过提取元路径诱导的子图并应用GNN来学习每个子图中具有不同语义的节点嵌入，有效地利用了异构信息。这种方法提高了生成的攻击对目标HGNN的可转移性，并显著减少了攻击数量。",
