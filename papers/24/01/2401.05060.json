    "abstract": "Research in toxicity detection in natural language processing for the speech modality (audio-based) is quite limited, particularly for languages other than English.

The dataset comprises 20,000 audio utterances for English and Spanish, and 4,000 for the other 19 languages. To demonstrate the quality of this dataset, we trained the MuTox audio-based toxicity classifier, which enables zero-shot toxicity detection across a wide range of languages. This classifier outperforms existing text-based trainable classifiers by more than 1% AUC, while expanding the language coverage more than tenfold.

    "translated_abstract": "语音模态（基于音频）自然语言处理中的毒性检测研究相对有限，特别是对于非英语语言而言。为了解决这些限制，并为真正多语言的基于音频的毒性检测奠定基础，我们引入了MuTox，这是第一个具有毒性标签的高度多语言的基于音频的数据集。该数据集包含20,000个英语和西班牙语音频片段，以及其他19种语言的4,000个片段。为了证明数据集的质量，我们训练了MuTox基于音频的毒性分类器，它能够在各种语言中进行零样本毒性检测。与现有的基于文本训练的分类器相比，该分类器的AUC性能提高了超过1%，同时扩大了语言覆盖范围十倍以上。与基于词汇列表的具有相似语言覆盖数量的分类器相比，MuTox的精度和召回率提高了约2.5倍。这个显著的改进突显了其潜在的创新性和贡献。",
