    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于混合公式（Hull＆White 1987，Romano＆Touzi 1997）的逼近方法，用于在Barndorff-Nielsen和Shephard模型中定价欧式期权。该逼近方法基于期权价格的泰勒展开。它使用递归算法实现，可以得到任意阶数的期权价格的闭式逼近（在背景驱动的L\\'evy过程满足技术条件的情况下）。该方法适用于任何类型的Barndorff-Nielsen和Shephard随机波动率模型。在背景驱动的L\\'evy过程的稳态分布为倒数高斯分布或伽马分布的情况下，我们给出了明确的结果。在这两种情况下，该逼近方法与特征函数产生的期权价格相比具有良好的比较效果。特别地，我们还对该逼近方法进行了误差分析，部分基于Das＆Langren\\'e（2022）的结果。我们得到了误差的渐近结果。",
