    "translated_abstract": "目前解决随机最短路径问题的方法是通过应用Bellman备份来找到状态的成本，而最先进的方法使用启发式策略选择需要备份和修剪的状态。这些算法的一个基本限制是需要在每个状态备份期间计算每个适用操作的成本，这导致对于被识别为次优的操作进行了不必要的计算。我们提出了规划和运筹学之间的新联系，并利用这个框架解决了这个不必要计算的问题，引入了一种高效的随机最短路径问题约束生成技术。这种技术使算法能够忽略次优操作并避免计算它们的成本。我们还将这种新技术应用于iLAO*算法，得到了一个新的算法CG-iLAO*。我们的实验证明，CG-iLAO*忽略了最多57%的iLAO*操作，并且比LRTDP和iLAO*解决问题的速度提高了8倍和3倍。",
