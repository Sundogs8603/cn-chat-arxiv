    "abstract": "Affordability is often seen as a barrier to consuming sustainable diets. This study provides the first worldwide test of how retail food prices relate to empirically estimated environmental impacts and nutritional profile scores between and within food groups. We use prices for 811 retail food items commonly sold in 181 countries during 2011 and 2017, matched to estimated carbon and water footprints and nutritional profiles, to test whether healthier and more environmentally sustainable foods are more expensive between and within food groups. We find that within almost all groups, less expensive items have significantly lower carbon and water footprints. Associations are strongest for animal source foods, where each 10% lower price is associated with 20 grams lower CO2-equivalent carbon and 5 liters lower water footprint per 100kcal. Gradients between price and nutritional profile vary by food group, price range, and nutritional attribute. In contrast, lower-priced items have lower nut",

    "translated_abstract": "负担能力常被视为消费可持续饮食的障碍。本研究首次在全球范围内测试了零售食品价格与经验估计的环境影响和营养评分之间以及食品组内的关系。我们使用2011年和2017年在181个国家常见销售的811种零售食品的价格与估计的碳足迹、水足迹和营养信息进行匹配，测试更健康和更环境可持续的食品在食品组内和食品组间是否更昂贵。我们发现在几乎所有食品组中，价格较低的物品具有显著较低的碳足迹和水足迹。对于动物源性食品，相关性最强，每降低10%的价格与每100kcal的二氧化碳当量碳减少20克和水足迹减少5升。价格与营养信息之间的梯度因食品组、价格范围和营养属性而异。相比之下，价格较低的物品具有较低的营养信息。",

The research reveals that lower-priced foods have lower carbon and water footprints, particularly for animal source foods. Additionally, the relationship between price and nutritional profile varies depending on the food group, price range, and nutritional attribute."
