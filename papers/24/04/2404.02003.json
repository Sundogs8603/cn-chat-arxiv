However, most existing methods still suffer from invalid local structure or unrealistic conformation issues, which are mainly due to the poor leaning of bond angles or torsional angles. To alleviate these problems, we propose AUTODIFF, a diffusion-based fragment-wise autoregressive generation model. Specifically, we design a novel molecule assembly strategy named conformal motif that preserves the conformation of local structures of molecules first, then we encode the interaction of the protein-ligand complex with an SE(3)-equivariant convolutional network and generate molecules motif-by-motif with diffusion modeling. In addition, we also improve the evaluation framework of SBDD by constraining the molecular weights of the genera",

    "translated_abstract": "结构基药物设计（SBDD）旨在生成能够紧密结合靶蛋白的分子，是药物发现中的一个关键问题，先前的方法已经取得了初步成功。然而，大多数现有方法仍然存在无效的局部结构或不现实的构象问题，这主要是由于键角或扭转角度的倾斜不足造成的。为了缓解这些问题，我们提出了AUTODIFF，一种基于扩散的分段自回归生成模型。具体而言，我们设计了一种名为conformal motif的新型分子组装策略，首先保留分子的局部结构的构象，然后我们使用SE(3)-等变卷积网络编码蛋白质-配体复合物的相互作用，并通过扩散建模逐个motif生成分子。此外，我们还通过约束生成分子的分子质量改进了SBDD的评估框架。",
