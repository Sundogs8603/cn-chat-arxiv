However, this intuitive idea has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose a framework of utilizing interpretation methods and gold rationales to enhance models. Our framework is very general in the sense that it can incorporate various interpretation methods. Previously proposed gradient-based methods can be shown as an instance of our framework.

    "translated_abstract": "在神经自然语言处理的时代，有许多作品试图推导神经模型的解释。直观地，当在训练过程中存在黄金解释时，可以额外训练模型使其与解释相匹配。然而，这种直观的想法尚未得到充分探讨。本文提出了一种利用解释方法和黄金解释来增强模型的框架。我们的框架在很大程度上是通用的，可以整合各种解释方法。先前提出的基于梯度的方法可以被证明是我们框架的一个实例。我们还提出了利用另外两种类型的解释方法，即擦除/替换型和提取型方法，用于增强模型的两个新颖实例。我们在各种任务上进行了全面实验。实验结果表明，我们的框架在低资源情况下尤其有效。",
