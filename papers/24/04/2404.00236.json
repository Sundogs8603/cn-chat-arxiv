For the content-based explicit comments/reviews interactions, some works attempt to utilize them to mine the semantic knowledge to enhance recommender models. However, they still neglect the following two points: (1) The content semantic is a universal world knowledge; how do we extract the multi-aspect semantic information to empower different domains?

    "translated_abstract": "在现实世界的应用中，用户在与不同项目互动时表现出不同的行为，包括隐式的点击/点赞互动以及显式的评论/评价互动。然而，几乎所有的推荐工作都集中在如何通过隐式的点击/点赞互动来描述用户偏好，以找到人们之间的协同。对于基于内容的显式评论/评价互动，一些工作尝试利用它们来挖掘语义知识以增强推荐模型。然而，它们仍然忽视了以下两点：（1）内容语义是普适的世界知识；我们如何提取多方面的语义信息以增强不同领域？（2）用户/项目ID特征是推荐模型的基础要素；我们如何对齐ID和内容语义特征空间？在本文中，我们提出了一种“插件”语义知识传递方法LoID。",
