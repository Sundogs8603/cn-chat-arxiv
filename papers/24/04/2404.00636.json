To achieve this, we introduce a tri-plane generator that directly generates a tri-plane of 3D prior by transferring the expression parameter of 3DMM into the source image. The tri-plane is then decoded into the image of different view through a differentiable volume rendering. Existing portrait animation methods heavily rely on image warping to transfer the expression in the motion space, challenging on disentanglement of appearance and expression. In contrast, we propose a contrastive pre-training framework for appearance-free expression parameter, eliminating undesirable appearance swap when transferring a cross-identity expression.

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们提出了一种一次性的3D感知肖像动画方法Export3D，能够控制给定肖像图像的面部表情和摄像机视角。为了实现这一目标，我们引入了一个三平面生成器，通过将3DMM的表情参数转移到源图像中直接生成3D先验的三平面。然后，通过可微分体积渲染将三平面解码为不同视角的图像。现有的肖像动画方法严重依赖于图像变形来在运动空间中传输表情，挑战在外观和表情的分离上。相比之下，我们提出了一个用于无外观表情参数的对比预训练框架，消除了在传输跨身份表达时不良外观交换。大量实验证明，我们的预训练框架能够学习隐藏在3DMM中的无外观表达表示。",
