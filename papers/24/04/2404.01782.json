The research method uses qualitative and quantitative approaches to integrate ecological, economic, and social aspects in the multicriteria analysis. The analysis involves land evaluation, subcriteria identification, and data integration using Multidimensional Scaling and Analytical Hierarchy Process methods to prioritize developing sustainable corn agricultural areas. Based on the results of the RAP-Corn analysis, it indicates that the ecological dimension depicts less sustainability.
