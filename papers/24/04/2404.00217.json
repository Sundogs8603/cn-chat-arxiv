However, these summaries can be too generic and lack supporting details. To address these issues, we propose a new paradigm for summarizing reviews, rationale-based opinion summarization. Rationale-based opinion summaries output the representative opinions as well as one or more corresponding rationales. To extract good rationales, we define four desirable properties: relatedness, specificity, popularity, and diversity and present a Gibbs-sampling-based method to extract rationales. Overall, we propose RATION, an unsupervised extractive system that has two components: an Opinion Extractor (to extract representative opinions) and Rationales Extractor (to extract corresponding rationales).
