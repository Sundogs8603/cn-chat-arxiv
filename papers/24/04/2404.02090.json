    "translated_abstract": "经验表明，典型的进化算法可以很好地应对诸如嘈杂的函数评估等随机干扰。在第一次针对$(1+\\lambda)$和$(1,\\lambda)$进化算法在先验位噪声存在时的数学运行时间分析中，我们表明两种算法都能容忍恒定的噪声概率，而不会增加在OneMax基准上的渐近运行时间。为此，种群规模$\\lambda$应至少为问题规模$n$的对数。在这方向上的唯一先前结果涉及不太现实的一位噪声模型，需要超线性的问题规模种群大小，并且对于OneMax基准证明了大致是无噪声运行时间的三次方的运行时间保证。我们的显着更强结果基于一种新颖的证明方法，即无噪声后代可以看作是父代和有噪声的后代之间的有偏统一交叉。",
