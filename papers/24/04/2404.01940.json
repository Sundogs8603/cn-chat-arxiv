    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.01940v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Understanding cybercrime communications is paramount for cybersecurity defence. This often involves translating communications into English for processing, interpreting, and generating timely intelligence. The problem is that translation is hard. Human translation is slow, expensive, and scarce. Machine translation is inaccurate and biased. We propose using fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLM) to generate translations that can accurately capture the nuances of cybercrime language. We apply our technique to public chats from the NoName057(16) Russian-speaking hacktivist group. Our results show that our fine-tuned LLM model is better, faster, more accurate, and able to capture nuances of the language. Our method shows it is possible to achieve high-fidelity translations and significantly reduce costs by a factor ranging from 430 to 23,000 compared to a human translator.",

    "translated_abstract": "理解网络犯罪通信对网络安全防御至关重要。这通常涉及将通信翻译成英文进行处理、解释和生成及时情报。问题在于翻译很困难。人工翻译缓慢、昂贵且稀缺。机器翻译不准确且存在偏见。我们提出使用精细调整的大型语言模型(LLM)生成能够准确捕捉网络犯罪语言细微差别的翻译。我们将我们的技术应用于来自NoName057(16)俄语黑客组织的公开聊天记录。我们的结果显示，我们的精细调整的LLM模型更好、更快、更准确，并能够捕捉语言的细微差别。我们的方法表明，通过与人工翻译相比比可实现高保真翻译，并将成本显著降低430至23,000倍。",
