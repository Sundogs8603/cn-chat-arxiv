    "translated_abstract": "集成方法，特别是Boosting，在表格数据中已被证明是高效且广泛应用的机器学习技术。在本文中，我们旨在利用传统Boosting方法的稳健预测能力，同时增强公平性和可解释性。为实现这一目标，我们开发了Fair MP-Boost，这是一种平衡公平性和准确性的随机Boosting方案，通过在训练期间自适应学习特征和观察来实现。具体来说，Fair MP-Boost依据自适应学习的特征和观察采样概率，顺序抽取小批量观察和特征，被称为minipatches (MP)。我们通过结合损失函数或特征重要性分数来设计这些概率，以同时解决准确性和公平性问题。因此，Fair MP-Boost优先考虑重要且公平的特征以及具有挑战性的实例，从而选择最相关的小批量。",
