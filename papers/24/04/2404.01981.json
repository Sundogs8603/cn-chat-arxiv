In clinical trials, patients are assessed based on their speech data to detect and monitor cognitive and mental health disorders. We propose using these speech recordings to verify the identities of enrolled patients and identify and exclude the individuals who try to enroll multiple times in the same trial. Since clinical studies are often conducted across different countries, creating a system that can perform speaker verification in diverse languages without additional development effort is imperative. We evaluate pre-trained TitaNet, ECAPA-TDNN, and SpeakerNet models by enrolling and testing with speech-impaired patients speaking English, German, Danish, Spanish, and Arabic languages. Our results demonstrate that tested models can effectively generalize ",
