TKG reasoning aims to predict future facts based on given historical ones. However, existing TKG reasoning models are unable to abstain from predictions they are uncertain, which will inevitably bring risks in real-world applications. Thus, in this paper, we propose an abstention mechanism for TKG reasoning, which helps the existing models make selective, instead of indiscriminate, predictions. Specifically, we develop a confidence estimator, called Confidence Estimator with History (CEHis), to enable the existing TKG reasoning models to first estimate their confidence in making predictions, and then abstain from those with low confidence. To do so, CEHis takes two kinds of information into consideration, namely, the certainty of the current prediction and the accuracy",

    "translated_abstract": "时间知识图（TKG）最近引起了广泛关注，它以（主体，关系，客体，时间戳）的形式描述了时间演变的事实。TKG推理旨在基于给定的历史事实预测未来事实。然而，现有的TKG推理模型无法避免对他们认为不确定的预测，这必然会在现实应用中带来风险。因此，在本文中，我们提出了一种适用于TKG推理的弃权机制，它可以帮助现有的模型进行选择性而非不加区别的预测。具体来说，我们开发了一种置信度估计器，称为带有历史信息的置信度估计器（CEHis），以使现有的TKG推理模型首先评估其在做出预测时的置信度，然后放弃那些置信度较低的预测。",
