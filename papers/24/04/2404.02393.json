    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.02393v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While multilingual machine translation (MNMT) systems hold substantial promise, they also have security vulnerabilities. Our research highlights that MNMT systems can be susceptible to a particularly devious style of backdoor attack, whereby an attacker injects poisoned data into a low-resource language pair to cause malicious translations in other languages, including high-resource languages. Our experimental results reveal that injecting less than 0.01% poisoned data into a low-resource language pair can achieve an average 20% attack success rate in attacking high-resource language pairs. This type of attack is of particular concern, given the larger attack surface of languages inherent to low-resource settings. Our aim is to bring attention to these vulnerabilities within MNMT systems with the hope of encouraging the community to address security concerns in machine translation, especially in the context of low-resource languages.",

    "translated_abstract": "虽然多语言机器翻译（MNMT）系统具有巨大的潜力，但它们也存在安全漏洞。我们的研究突出显示，MNMT系统容易受到一种特别狡诈的后门攻击，即攻击者向低资源语言对注入有毒数据，以在其他语言（包括高资源语言）中造成恶意翻译。我们的实验结果显示，将少于0.01％的有毒数据注入到低资源语言对中，就可以在攻击高资源语言对时实现平均20％的攻击成功率。这种类型的攻击尤其令人担忧，因为低资源环境下固有的语言更容易受到攻击。我们的目标是引起关于这些MNMT系统中的漏洞的关注，并希望激励社区解决机器翻译中的安全问题，特别是在低资源语言环境下。",
