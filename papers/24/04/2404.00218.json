    "translated_abstract": "与现有作品形成对比，现有作品都将节点视为函数，并使用边来表示不同函数之间的关系。我们的目标是网络建模，其中边是功能数据，并将邻接矩阵转换为功能邻接张量，引入一个额外的维度专门用于函数表示。我们使用Tucker功能分解来处理功能邻接张量，为进一步考虑节点之间的社区，对基础矩阵进行正则化使其对称化。此外，为了处理功能边的不规则观测，我们进行模型推断以解决张量完成问题，通过Riemann共轭梯度下降方法进行优化。除此之外，我们还推导出几个定理来展示功能边缘网络模型的理想属性。最后，我们使用模拟数据和真实地铁系统数据评估了我们提出的模型的有效性。",
