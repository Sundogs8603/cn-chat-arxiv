Prior work claimed this is due to linguistic dissimilarity between explicit and implicit examples but provided no empirical evidence. In this study, we show that one cause for such failure is a label shift after connectives are eliminated. Specifically, we find that the discourse relations expressed by some explicit instances will change when connectives disappear. Unlike previous work manually analyzing a few examples, we present empirical evidence at the corpus level to prove the existence of such shift. Then, we analyze why label shift occurs by considering factors such as the syntactic role played by connectives, ambiguity of connectives, and more.

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了篇章处理领域中一个未解之谜：为什么在真实的隐式情景中，在显式示例（去除连接词）上训练的关系分类器表现不佳？以前的工作声称这是因为显式和隐式示例之间的语言差异，但未提供实证证据。在这项研究中，我们展示了这种失败的一个原因是在去除连接词后标签发生了变化。具体地，我们发现一些显式实例表达的篇章关系在连接词消失后会发生变化。与以前手动分析少量示例的工作不同，我们提供了在语料库水平上的实证证据来证明这种变化的存在。然后，我们通过考虑连接词在句法中的作用、连接词的歧义性等因素，分析标签变化发生的原因。最后，我们研究了两种缓解标签变化的策略：过滤掉噪声数据",
