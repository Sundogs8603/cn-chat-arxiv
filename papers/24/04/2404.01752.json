For this problem, we propose a two-level approach where the low level is a sampling-based planner Safe Interval RRT* (SI-RRT*) that finds a collision-free trajectory for individual robots.

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们考虑了在连续空间中解决多机器人路径规划（MRPP）问题以找到无冲突路径的问题。问题的困难主要来自两个因素。首先，涉及多个机器人会导致组合决策，使搜索空间呈指数级增长。其次，连续空间呈现出潜在无限的状态和动作。针对这个问题，我们提出了一个两级方法，低级是基于采样的规划器安全间隔RRT*（SI-RRT*），用于找到单个机器人的无碰撞轨迹。高级可以使用能够解决机器人间冲突的任何方法，我们采用了两种代表性方法，即优先规划（SI-CPP）和基于冲突的搜索（SI-CCBS）。实验结果表明，SI-RRT*能够快速找到高质量解决方案，并且所需的样本数量较少。SI-CPP表现出更好的可扩展性，而SI-CCBS产生",
