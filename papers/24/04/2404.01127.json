While deep convolutional networks have achieved satisfactory results in medical image segmentation, they face challenges such as loss of lesion shape information due to continuous convolution and downsampling, as well as the high cost of manually labeling lesions with varying shapes and sizes. To address these issues, we propose a novel medical visual prompting (MVP) framework that leverages pre-training and prompting concepts from natural language processing (NLP). The framework utilizes three key components: Super-Pixel Guided Prompting (SPGP) for superpixelating the input image, Image Embedding Guided Prompting (IEGP) for freezing patch embedding and merging with superpixels to provide visual prompts, and Adaptive Attention Mechanism Guided Prompting (AAGP) for pinpointing prompt content and efficiently adapting all layer",

    "translated_abstract": "淋巴瘤区域的准确分割对于各种疾病的临床诊断和治疗至关重要。尽管深度卷积网络在医学图像分割中取得了令人满意的结果，但由于连续卷积和下采样造成了损失病变形状信息、以及手动标记不同形状和大小病变的高成本等挑战。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新颖的医疗视觉提示（MVP）框架，利用自然语言处理（NLP）中的预训练和提示概念。该框架利用三个关键组件：基于超像素的提示（SPGP）用于对输入图像进行超像素处理，图像嵌入引导提示（IEGP）用于冻结补丁嵌入并与超像素合并以提供视觉提示，以及自适应注意机制引导提示（AAGP）用于确定提示内容并有效地调整所有层",
