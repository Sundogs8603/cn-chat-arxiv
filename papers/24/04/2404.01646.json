In this paper, we introduce a pioneering methodology that amalgamates Transformer-based forecasting with weighted constrained Dynamic Time Warping (wcDTW) to refine scenario selection. Our approach harnesses the predictive capabilities of Transformers to foresee Energy prices, while wcDTW ensures the selection of pertinent historical scenarios by maintaining the coherence between multiple uncertain products. Through extensive simulations in the PJM market for July 2023, our method exhibited a 10% increase in revenue compared to the conventional method, highlighting its potential to revolutionize battery bidding strategies in real-time markets.",

    "translated_abstract": "实时能源市场中随机电池竞标是一个微妙的过程，其有效性取决于预测的准确性以及选择用于优化的代表性场景。在本文中，我们引入了一种先进的方法，将基于Transformer的预测与加权约束动态时间扭曲（wcDTW）相结合，以改进场景选择。我们的方法利用Transformer的预测能力来预测能源价格，而wcDTW通过维护多个不确定产品之间的一致性，确保选择相关的历史场景。通过在2023年7月的PJM市场进行广泛的模拟，我们的方法与传统方法相比收益增加了10％，突显了其有可能在实时市场中革新电池竞标策略的潜力。",
