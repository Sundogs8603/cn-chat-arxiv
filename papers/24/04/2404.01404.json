    "translated_abstract": "我们专注于基本的一对一双边匹配模型，在这个模型中有两个相等规模的不相交代理人集合，每个代理人在一个集合中对另一个集合中的代理人有偏好，这些偏好通过线性排序进行建模。目标是基于代理人的偏好找到将一个集合中的每个代理人与另一个集合中的一个且仅一个代理人关联的匹配。机制是将一组匹配与每个偏好配置关联的规则。稳定性指的是机制应满足的只选择稳定匹配的能力，而另一个特别适用于应用的关键特性是坚决性，这要求机制总是选择唯一的匹配。延迟接受算法的两个版本是稳定和坚决的机制的示例。然而，这些机制非常不公平，因为它们严重偏向于市场的两侧。在这篇论文中，我们...",
