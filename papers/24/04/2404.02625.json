    "translated_abstract": "Integer Linear Programming（ILP）被提出作为对自然语言推理（NLI）进行精确结构和语义约束编码的正式形式。然而，传统的ILP框架是不可微分的，这给基于深度学习的连续语言表示的整合带来了关键挑战。本文介绍了一种新方法，名为Diff-Comb Explainer，这是一种基于可微黑盒组合求解器（DBCS）的解释型NLI的神经符号架构。与现有的神经符号求解器不同，Diff-Comb Explainer不需要对语义约束进行连续放松，从而能够直接、更精确和高效地将神经表示融入到ILP公式中。我们的实验表明，与传统ILP求解器、神经符号黑盒求解器和Trans相比，Diff-Comb Explainer实现了更优越的性能。",
