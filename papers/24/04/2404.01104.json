However, they neglect to evaluate the quality of their constructed sentiment representations; they just focus on improving the fine-tuning performance, which overshadows the representation quality. We argue that without guaranteeing the representation quality, their downstream performance can be highly dependent on the supervision of the fine-tuning data rather than representation quality. This problem would make them difficult to foray into other sentiment-related domains, especially where labeled data is scarce.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，情感感知的预训练语言模型（PLMs）在下游情感分析任务中展现出了令人印象深刻的结果。然而，它们忽视了评估构建的情感表示的质量；它们只专注于提高微调性能，这遮蔽了表示质量。我们认为，如果不能保证表示质量，它们的下游性能可能高度依赖于微调数据的监督，而不是表示质量。这个问题会使它们很难进入其他情感相关领域，特别是在标注数据稀缺的情况下。我们首先提出了情感引导文本相似性（SgTS），这是一种用于评估情感表示质量的新颖指标，它基于两个句子之间情感极性等价程度进行设计。然后我们提出了SentiCSE，一种新颖的具有情感感知对比的句子嵌入框架。",
