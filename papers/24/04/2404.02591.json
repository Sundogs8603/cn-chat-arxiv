    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.02591v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The Hot Stove Effect is a negativity bias resulting from the adaptive character of learning. The mechanism is that learning algorithms that pursue alternatives with positive estimated values, but avoid alternatives with negative estimated values, will correct errors of overestimation but fail to correct errors of underestimation. Here, we generalize the theory behind the Hot Stove Effect to settings in which negative estimates do not necessarily lead to avoidance but to a smaller sample size (i.e., a learner selects fewer of alternative B if B is believed to be inferior but does not entirely avoid B). We formally demonstrate that the negativity bias remains in this set-up. We also show there is a negativity bias for Bayesian learners in the sense that most such learners underestimate the expected value of an alternative.",

    "translated_abstract": "热炉效应是由于学习的适应性特性所导致的一种消极偏见。研究发现，追求估计值为正的替代方案，避开估计值为负的替代方案的学习算法将纠正高估误差，但无法纠正低估误差。本文将热炉效应的理论推广到负估计不一定导致避免而是导致样本量较小的情况（即，如果B被认为是次优的，学习者会选择更少的替代方案B而非完全避免B）。我们形式上证明了在这种设置中消极偏见仍然存在。我们还表明，贝叶斯学习者存在消极偏见，即大多数这样的学习者低估替代方案的预期价值。",
    "tldr": "学习者倾向于估计值为正的替代方案，避开估计值为负的替代方案，导致高估误差纠正但低估误差无法纠正，同时研究发现在一些情况下负估计会导致选择较少的样本量，这种消极偏见同样存在于贝叶斯学习者中。",
    "en_tdlr": "Learners tend to pursue alternatives with positive estimated values and avoid alternatives with negative estimated values, which corrects overestimation errors but fails to correct underestimation errors; negative estimates may lead to selecting a smaller sample size, and this negativity bias is also present in Bayesian learners."
