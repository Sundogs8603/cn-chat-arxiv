    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了人工智能在神经机器翻译（NMT）系统中的伦理挑战，强调开发者确保公平性和文化敏感性的必要性。我们调查了NMT中AI模型的伦理素养，审视了NMT开发的每个阶段的伦理考虑，包括数据处理、隐私、数据所有权和同意。我们通过实证研究确定并解决了伦理问题。这些问题包括利用Transformer模型进行卢干达语-英语翻译，以及利用句子迷你批处理提高效率。我们还进行了细化数据标记技术和对卢干达语和英语社交媒体内容进行BERT和Longformer模型的微调等补充研究。我们的第二种方法是来自Google Scholar等数据库和GitHub等平台的文献综述。此外，本文还探讨了AI系统与相关责任之间的分配。",
