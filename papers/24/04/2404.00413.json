We intend to apply these concepts to the field of Guidance, Navigation, and Control in space, enabling LLMs to have a significant role in the decision-making process for autonomous satellite operations. As a first step towards this goal, we have developed a pure LLM-based solution for the Kerbal Space Program Differential Games (KSPDG) challenge, a public software design competition where participants create autonomous agents for maneuvering satellites involved in non-cooperative space operations, running on the KSP game engine. Our approach leverages prompt engineering, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning techniques to create an effective LLM-based agent that ranked 2nd in the competition.

    "translated_abstract": "最近出现了一个趋势，即广泛采用大型语言模型(LLMs)作为根据用户文本提示内容采取行动的自主代理。我们打算将这些概念应用于空间导航和控制领域，使LLMs在自主卫星操作的决策过程中扮演重要角色。作为实现这一目标的第一步，我们为 Kerbal 太空计划差分游戏(KSPDG)挑战开发了一种纯LLM方案，这是一个公开的软件设计竞赛，参与者为卫星操纵创建自主代理，在KSP游戏引擎上运行。我们的方法利用提示工程、少样本提示和微调技术创建了一个效果良好的LLM代理，在竞赛中排名第二。据我们所知，这项工作开创了将LLM代理整合到空间资源中的先河。",
