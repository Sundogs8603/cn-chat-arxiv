Recently, text detoxification methods found their applications in various task such as detoxification of Large Language Models (LLMs) (Leong et al., 2023; He et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2023) and toxic speech combating in social networks (Deng et al., 2023; Mun et al., 2023; Agarwal et al., 2023).

However, the previous approaches for parallel text detoxification corpora collection -- ParaDetox (Logacheva et al., 2022) and APPADIA (Atwell et al., 2022) -- were explored only in monolingual setup.

    "translated_abstract": "文本净化是一项文本风格转换（TST）任务，其中文本被从有毒的表面形式，例如包含粗鲁词汇，转述为中性语体。最近，文本净化方法在各种任务中找到了应用，比如净化大型语言模型（LLMs）（Leong等，2023；He等，2024；Tang等，2023）以及在社交网络中对抗有毒言论（Deng等，2023；Mun等，2023；Agarwal等，2023）。所有这些应用对于确保现代数字世界中的安全沟通至关重要。然而，以前用于并行文本净化语料库收集的方法-- ParaDetox（Logacheva等，2022）和APPADIA（Atwell等，2022）-- 仅在单语言设置中进行了探讨。在本研究中，我们旨在将ParaDetox流程扩展到多种语言，提出MultiParaDetox以自动化潜在任何语言的并行净化语料库收集。",
