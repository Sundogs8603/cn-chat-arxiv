In this paper, we build a model that can provide a comparable holistic indicator of toxicity targeted toward male and female identity and male and female individuals.

    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2404.02205v1 公告类型: 跨领域 摘要: 男权主义者和女权主义者在社交网络上的在线趋势需要一个整体性的衡量性别歧视水平的指标。这个指标对于政策制定者和在线社区的管理员（如subreddits）以及计算社会科学家至关重要，他们可以根据性别歧视程度修改管理策略，或者匹配和比较不同平台和社区上的时态性别歧视，以及推断社会科学见解。在本文中，我们建立了一个模型，可以提供一个可比较的针对男性、女性身份以及男性、女性个人的毒性整体指标。尽管先前的监督NLP方法需要在目标级别对有毒评论进行注释（例如注释特别针对女性有毒的评论）来检测针对性有毒评论，我们的指标利用监督式NLP来检测毒性的存在。",
