However, long-term mental well-being requires emotional self-regulation, where a one-time empathic response falls short. This work takes a first step by engaging with cognitive reappraisals, a strategy from psychology practitioners that uses language to targetedly change negative appraisals that an individual makes of the situation; such appraisals is known to sit at the root of human emotional experience. We hypothesize that psychologically grounded principles could enable such advanced psychology capabilities in LLMs, and design RESORT which consists of a series of reappraisal constitutions across multiple dimensions that can be used as LLM instructions. We conduct a first-of-its-kind expert evaluation (by clinical psychologists with M.S. or Ph.D. degrees) of an LLM",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）为情感支持提供了新的机会，最近的研究表明，它们可以对处于困境中的人产生共情回应。然而，长期的心理健康需要情绪自我调节，而一次性的共情回应则显得力不从心。本文通过参与认知重评迈出了第一步，认知重评是心理学从业者使用语言有针对性地改变个体对情境的负面评价的策略；这种评价被认为是人类情感体验的根源。我们假设心理学上的原则可以使LLMs具备这种先进的心理学能力，并设计了RESORT，其中包括一系列跨多个维度的重评构成，可用作LLM的指导。我们对LLM进行了首次专家评估（由持有硕士或博士学位的临床心理学家进行）。",
