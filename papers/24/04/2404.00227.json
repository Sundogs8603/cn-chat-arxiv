    "translated_abstract": "基础设施即代码（IaC）是一种革命性的方法，在业内获得了显著的突出地位。 IaC通过使用可机器读取的代码来管理和提供IT基础设施，实现自动化、环境之间的一致性、可再现性、版本控制、减少错误和增强可扩展性。然而，IaC编排通常是一项费时费力的工作，需要专业技能和大量手动工作。自动化IaC在当前行业条件下是必不可少的，在本调查中，我们研究了应用大型语言模型（LLM）来解决这一问题的可行性。LLM是基于大型神经网络的模型，表现出显著的语言处理能力，并且显示出能够在广泛范围内遵循一系列指令的能力。最近，它们也已成功地被转化为代码理解和生成任务，这使它们成为可能",
