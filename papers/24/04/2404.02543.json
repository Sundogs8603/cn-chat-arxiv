    "translated_abstract": "无偏向学习排序（ULTR）是一个用于学习用户点击数据的成熟框架，而这些数据往往受收集数据的排名者的偏见影响。虽然在理论上得到证明并在模拟中进行了广泛测试，但ULTR技术缺乏经验验证，尤其是在现代搜索引擎中。百度搜索引擎发布的WSDM Cup 2023数据集为评估主要ULTR技术在真实世界中的表现提供了难得的机会。尽管在WSDM Cup 2023期间有多次提交，以及随后的NTCIR ULTRE-2任务，但目前还不清楚观察到的改进是否源自应用ULTR或其他学习技术。我们重新审视并扩展了现有实验。我们发现，无偏向学习排序技术并不能明显提升性能，尤其是与排名损失和查询-文档特征选择带来的明显差异相比。",
