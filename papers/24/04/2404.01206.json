    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.01206v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: With the implementation of personal data privacy regulations, the field of machine learning (ML) faces the challenge of the \"right to be forgotten\". Machine unlearning has emerged to address this issue, aiming to delete data and reduce its impact on models according to user requests. Despite the widespread interest in machine unlearning, comprehensive surveys on its latest advancements, especially in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) is lacking. This survey aims to fill this gap by providing an in-depth exploration of machine unlearning, including the definition, classification and evaluation criteria, as well as challenges in different environments and their solutions. Specifically, this paper categorizes and investigates unlearning on both traditional models and LLMs, and proposes methods for evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of unlearning, and standards for performance measurement.
