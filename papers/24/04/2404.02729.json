It remains largely unclear how the brain learns to store and retrieve sequence memories. Here, we study how recurrent networks of binary neurons learn sequence attractors to store predefined pattern sequences and retrieve them robustly. We show that to store arbitrary pattern sequences, it is necessary for the network to include hidden neurons even though their role in displaying sequence memories is indirect. We develop a local learning algorithm to learn sequence attractors in the networks with hidden neurons. The algorithm is proven to converge and lead to sequence attractors. We demonstrate that the network model can store and retrieve sequences robustly on synthetic and real-world datasets. We hope that this study provides new insights in understanding sequence memory and temporal information processing in the brain.",

    "translated_abstract": "大脑被设计用来处理时间序列信息。目前尚不清楚大脑是如何学习存储和检索序列记忆的。在本研究中，我们研究了具有二进制神经元的递归网络如何学习序列吸引子，以存储预定义的模式序列并稳健地检索它们。我们表明，为了存储任意模式序列，网络需要包含隐藏神经元，即使它们在显示序列记忆方面的作用是间接的。我们开发了一种局部学习算法，用于学习带有隐藏神经元的网络中的序列吸引子。该算法被证明会收敛并导致序列吸引子。我们展示了该网络模型可以在合成和真实数据集上稳健地存储和检索序列。我们希望这项研究能够为理解大脑中的序列记忆和时间信息处理提供新的见解。",
