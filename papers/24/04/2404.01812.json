We use an ensemble of partially constructed NeRF models to quantify model uncertainty to determine the next action (a visual or re-orientation action) by optimizing informativeness and feasibility.

    "translated_abstract": "在没有三维表示的情况下操作看不见的物体是具有挑战性的，因为物体通常有遮挡表面。这需要通过与物体的物理交互来构建它们的内部表示。本文提出了一种方法，使机器人能够快速学习给定物体的完整三维模型，以便在陌生方向进行操作。我们使用部分构造的NeRF模型的集成来量化模型的不确定性，以确定下一步行动（视觉或重新定位行动），通过优化信息量和可行性。此外，我们的方法确定何时以及如何抓取和重新定位物体，鉴于其部分NeRF模型，并重新估计物体姿态以纠正交互过程中引入的错位。在模拟环境中对使用基准物体操作的Franka Emika机械手操作者进行实验，表明视觉重建质量提高了14%。",
