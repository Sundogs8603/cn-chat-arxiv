    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.02858v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper we provide more general features for the variable annuity contract with LTC payouts and GLWB proposed by the state-of-the-art and we refine its pricing methods. In particular, as to product features, we allow dynamic withdrawal strategies, including the surrender option. Furthermore, we consider stochastic interest rate, described by a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process. As to the numerical methods, we solve the stochastic control problem involved by the selection of the optimal withdrawal strategy by means of a robust tree method. We use such a method to estimate the fair price of the product. Furthermore, our numerical results show how the optimal withdrawal strategy varies over time with the health status of the policyholder. Our proposed tree method, we name Tree-LTC, proves to be efficient and reliable, when tested against the Monte Carlo approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们为具有LTC支付和GLWB的可变年金合同提供了更通用的特性，并完善了其定价方法。特别是，在产品特性方面，我们允许动态提取策略，包括投降选项。此外，我们考虑随机利率，由Cox-Ingersoll-Ross（CIR）过程描述。至于数值方法，我们通过一个稳健的树方法解决了涉及通过选择最佳提取策略而涉及的随机控制问题。我们使用这种方法来估计产品的公平价格。此外，我们的数值结果显示了最佳提取策略如何随着投保人的健康状况而随时间变化。我们提出的树方法，我们命名为Tree-LTC，在与蒙特卡洛方法进行对比时证明是高效且可靠的。",
