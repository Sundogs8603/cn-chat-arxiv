    "translated_abstract": "叙事推理依赖于对故事情境中事件的理解，这需要丰富的背景世界知识。为了帮助机器利用这种知识，现有解决方案可分为两类。一些侧重于通过预训练语言模型（LMs）的事件感知目标来隐式建模事件知识。然而，这种方法会破坏知识结构并缺乏可解释性。另一些则将事件的世界知识明确地收集到结构化的以事件为中心的知识图谱（KGs）中。然而，目前关于利用这些知识源进行自由文本处理的研究有限。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个名为EventGround的初步综合框架，旨在解决将自由文本与以事件为中心的知识图谱进行关联的问题，以进行情境化叙事推理。我们确定了在这个方向上的两个关键问题：事件表征和稀疏性",
