Productive engagement with LMs in such scenarios necessitates that humans discern effective text-based interaction strategies, such as editing and response styles, from historical human-LM interactions. This objective is inherently causal, driven by the counterfactual `what-if' question: how would the outcome of collaboration change if humans employed a different text editing/refinement strategy? A key challenge in answering this causal inference question is formulating an appropriate causal estimand: the conventional average treatment effect (ATE) estimand is inapplicable to text-based treatments due to their high dimensionality.

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们研究了人类和语言模型（LMs）之间的协作动态，这些互动通常涉及LMs提出文本段落，而人类编辑或回应这些建议。在这种情况下与LMs进行有效的互动要求人类辨别出有效的基于文本的互动策略，例如编辑和回应样式，从历史人类-LM互动中。这个目标本质上是因果关系，受到反事实“如果”问题的驱动:如果人类采用不同的文本编辑/精炼策略，协作的结果会如何改变？回答这个因果推断问题的一个关键挑战是制定一个适当的因果估计:传统的平均处理效应（ATE）估计由于文本的高维度而不适用于基于文本的处理。为了解决这一问题，我们引入了一个新的因果估计 - 增量风格效应",
