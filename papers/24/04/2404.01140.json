    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.01140v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present KoCoNovel, an novel character coreference dataset derived from Korean literary texts, complete with detailed annotation guidelines. Comprising 178K tokens from 50 modern and contemporary Korean novels, KoCoNovel stands as the second-largest public coreference resolution corpus in Korean, after the NIKL corpus, and the first to be based on literary texts. To broaden its utility, we provide four distinct versions of KoCoNovel, offering options for the perspectives of the omniscient author and readers, and for handling multiple entities as either separate or overlapping. This approach integrates existing discourse surrounding coreference resolution in literary texts, providing a comprehensive dataset for exploration. One of KoCoNovel's distinctive features is that 24% of all character mentions are single common nouns, lacking possessive markers or articles. This feature is particularly influenced by the nuances of Korean address ",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了KoCoNovel，这是一个从韩国文学文本中衍生出的小说人物共指数据集，配备了详细的注释指南。KoCoNovel由50部现代和当代韩国小说中的178,000个标记组成，是继NIKL语料库之后韩语公共共指解决语料库中第二大规模的数据集，也是第一个基于文学文本的数据集。为了扩大其实用性，我们提供了四个不同版本的KoCoNovel，为全知作者和读者的观点以及处理多实体的分离或重叠提供选择。这种方法整合了围绕文学文本共指解析的现有话语，为研究提供了一个全面的数据集。KoCoNovel的一个显著特点是24%的人物提及是单一普通名词，缺少所有格标记或冠词。这一特征特别受到韩语称谓的细微差别的影响。",
