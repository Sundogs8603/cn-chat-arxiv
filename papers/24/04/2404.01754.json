    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2404.01754v1 通告类型:跨领域 摘要:自动化生成针对编程作业的反馈对编程教育具有重要意义，尤其是在涉及高级作业时。自动程序修复技术，尤其是基于大型语言模型的方法，因其具有修复入门作业潜力而备受认可。然而，用于评估的程序相对简单。现有方法在修复来自高级编程课程的程序方面的表现仍不清楚。为了解决这些限制，我们从高级编程课程中创建了一个名为Defects4DS的新高级学生作业数据集。随后，我们确定了在修复高级作业中的错误方面所面临的挑战。基于分析，我们开发了一个名为PaR的由LLM驱动的框架。PaR分为三个阶段运行：同行解决方案选择、多源提示生成和程序修复。",
    "tldr": "该研究提出了一个名为PaR的新框架，通过大型语言模型的支持，能够修复高级编程作业中的程序错误。"
