    "translated_abstract": "摩擦是水动力建模的关键之一；洪水条件对用于计算动量损失的摩擦系数（FFs）非常敏感。然而，经验性的摩擦系数难以测量，因为需要进行实验室实验。洪水模型通常依赖于替代性观测（如土地利用）来估计摩擦系数，导致不确定性。本研究提出了一个经过实验室训练的深度神经网络（DNN），使用数据增强技术，根据点云数据测量Manning's n。该DNN被部署在真实世界的激光雷达点云上，直接测量了在监管和极端暴雨事件下的Manning's n，展示了在1D和2D水动力模型中都有改进的预测能力。对于1D模型，与土地覆盖值相比，激光雷达数值使得河道水深的差异减小了。对于1D/2D耦合模型，激光雷达数值产生",
