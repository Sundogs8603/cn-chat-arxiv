Acoustic methods in such predominantly indoor scenarios encounter difficulty due to the reverberant nature. In this study, we aim to locate sound sources to specific locations within a virtual environment by leveraging physically grounded sound propagation simulations and machine learning methods. This process attempts to overcome the issue of data insufficiency to localize sound sources to their location of occurrence especially in post-event localization. We achieve 0.786+/- 0.0136 F1-score using an audio transformer spectrogram approach.",
