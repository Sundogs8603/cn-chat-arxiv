This paper introduces the CMU Linguistic Annotation Backend, an open-source framework that simplifies model deployment and continuous human-in-the-loop fine-tuning of NLP models.

    "translated_abstract": "使用自然语言处理（NLP）工具来有效地处理资源匮乏的语言需要对语言本身有深入了解，熟悉最新的模型和训练方法，以及具备部署这些模型的技术专长。这可能对语言社区成员和语言学家使用NLP工具构成重大障碍。本文介绍了CMU语言注释后端，这是一个开源框架，简化了模型部署和持续的人机协作对NLP模型进行微调的过程。CMULAB使用户能够利用多语言模型的强大功能，快速对语音识别、OCR、翻译和句法分析等工具进行适应和扩展至新语言，即使训练数据有限。我们描述了目前可用的各种工具和API以及开发人员如何轻松地向框架添加新模型/功能。代码可在https://github.com/neula找到",
