To accomplish the mission, it is essential to maintain the power of the telecom base stations. Here we consider a solution where electric vehicles (EVs) directly supply power to base stations by traveling to their locations. The goal is to find EV routes that minimize both the total travel distance of all EVs and the number of downed base stations. In this paper, we formulate this routing problem as a new variant of the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) and propose a solver that combines a rule-based vehicle selector and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based node selector. The rule of the vehicle selector ensures the exact environmental states when the selected EV starts to move. In addition, the node selection by the RL model enables fast route generation, which is critical in emergencies. We evaluate our solver on bot",

    "translated_abstract": "作为一家电信提供商，我们公司有一个关键使命，即在停电期间保持电信服务。为了实现这一使命，至关重要的是维持电信基站的电力。本文考虑一种解决方案，即电动车辆 (EVs) 直接前往其位置为基站提供电力。我们的目标是找到最小化所有电动车辆的总行驶距离和故障基站数量的EV路线。在本文中，我们将这一路径问题形式化为新型的电动车辆路径问题 (EVRP) 变体，并提出了将基于规则的车辆选择器和基于强化学习（RL）的节点选择器相结合的求解器。车辆选择器的规则确保了所选EV开始移动时的确切环境状态。此外，RL模型的节点选择实现了快速路径生成，在紧急情况下尤为重要。我们在机器人上对我们的求解器进行评估",
