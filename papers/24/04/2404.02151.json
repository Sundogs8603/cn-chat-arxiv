    "translated_abstract": "我们展示了即使是最新的安全对齐的LLM也不具有抵抗简单自适应越狱攻击的稳健性。首先，我们展示了如何成功利用对logprobs的访问进行越狱：我们最初设计了一个对抗性提示模板（有时会适应目标LLM），然后我们在后缀上应用随机搜索以最大化目标logprob（例如token“Sure”），可能会进行多次重启。通过这种方式，我们实现了对GPT-3.5/4、Llama-2-Chat-7B/13B/70B、Gemma-7B和针对GCG攻击进行对抗训练的HarmBench上的R2D2等几乎100%的攻击成功率--根据GPT-4的评判。我们还展示了如何通过转移或预填充攻击以100%的成功率对所有不暴露logprobs的Claude模型进行越狱。此外，我们展示了如何在受污染的模型中使用对一组受限制的token执行随机搜索以查找木马字符串的方法--这项任务与许多其他任务共享相同的属性。",
