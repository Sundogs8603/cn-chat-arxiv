    "translated_abstract": "从合成孔径雷达（SAR）图像中检测输电塔仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务，这是由于输电塔的相对较小尺寸和侧视几何形状，背景杂波干扰经常阻碍了塔的识别。大量的干扰信号叠加在塔的回波信号上。我们发现，定位或提示输电塔的位置有利于解决这一障碍。基于这一发现，本文将提示学习引入到面向对象检测器（P2Det）进行多模态信息学习。P2Det包含了稀疏提示编码和多模态数据之间的交叉注意力。具体来说，提出了稀疏提示编码器（SPE）来表示点位置，将提示转换为稀疏嵌入。图像嵌入是通过Transformer层生成的。然后，提出了一个双向融合模块（TWFM）来计算交叉注意力。",
