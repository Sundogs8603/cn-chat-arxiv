Recent works have shown that training with only limited data can show a superior performance on general tasks. However, the feasibility on mathematical reasoning tasks has not been validated. To go further, there exist two open questions for mathematical reasoning: how to select influential data and what is an influential data composition. For the former one, we propose a Quality-aware Diverse Selection (QaDS) strategy adaptable for mathematical reasoning. A comparison with other selection strategies validates the superiority of QaDS.

    "translated_abstract": "选择对下游任务微调具有影响力的数据是性能和计算效率的关键因素。最近的研究表明，仅使用有限数据进行训练在通用任务上可以表现出卓越性能。然而，对于数学推理任务，这种可行性尚未得到验证。为此，针对数学推理存在两个开放问题：如何选择具有影响力的数据以及什么是具有影响力的数据组成。对于前者，我们提出了一个适用于数学推理的质量感知多样选择（QaDS）策略。与其他选择策略进行比较验证了QaDS的优越性。对于后者，我们首先扩大了我们的设置并探索了具有影响力的数据组成。我们进行了一系列实验并强调：扩大推理数据规模，并训练选用QaDS选择的通用数据是有益的。然后，我们将我们的最佳混合定义为OpenMathMix。",
