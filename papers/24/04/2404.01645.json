    "translated_abstract": "Transformer-based模型的成功鼓舞了许多研究人员使用基于序列的方法学习CAD模型。然而，学习CAD模型仍然是一个挑战，因为它们可以被表示为具有长构建序列的复杂形状。此外，相同的CAD模型可以用不同的CAD构建序列来表示。我们提出了一种名为ContrastCAD的新颖基于对比学习的方法，该方法有效地捕捉CAD模型构建序列中的语义信息。ContrastCAD使用辍学技术生成增强视图而不改变CAD模型的形状。我们还提出了一种新的CAD数据增强方法，称为随机替换和挤出（RRE）方法，以增强模型在训练不平衡的训练CAD数据集时的学习性能。实验结果表明，所提出的RRE增强方法显着提高了学习性能。",
