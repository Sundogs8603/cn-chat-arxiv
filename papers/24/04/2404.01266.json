    "translated_abstract": "当前的基础模型在仅文本或图像和文本输入同时提示时表现出令人印象深刻的能力。但它们的能力是否会根据输入方式而改变呢？在这项工作中，我们提出了一个名为$\\textbf{IsoBench}$的基准数据集，其中包含来自四个主要领域的问题: 数学、科学、算法和游戏。每个示例呈现了多个输入的同构表示，如视觉、文本和数学展示。IsoBench提供了细粒度的反馈，以诊断由表示形式造成的性能差距。在各种基础模型中，我们观察到在相同问题上，模型一贯偏好文本表示。最突出的是，在所有IsoBench问题上进行评估时，Claude-3 Opus在提供图像而不是文本时性能下降28.7分；同样，GPT-4 Turbo性能下降18.7分，Gemini Pro下降14.9分。",
