Despite this substantial health burden, available treatments for the disease are limited and its fundamental causes remain poorly understood. Previous work has suggested the existence of clinically-meaningful sub-types, which it is suggested may correspond to distinct etiologies, disease courses, and ultimately appropriate treatments. Here, we use unsupervised learning techniques on electronic health records (EHRs) from a cohort of memory disorder patients to characterise heterogeneity in this disease population. Pre-trained embeddings for medical codes as well as transformer-derived Clinical BERT embeddings of free text are used to encode patient EHRs. We identify the existence of sub-populations on the basis of comorbidities and shared textual features, and discuss their clinical significance.",

    "translated_abstract": "阿尔茨海默病是一种进行性的、使人衰弱的神经退行性疾病，全球有5000万人受影响。尽管这是一个巨大的健康负担，但目前治疗手段有限，其根本原因仍然知之甚少。先前的研究表明存在临床意义的亚型，可能对应于不同的病因、疾病进程，以及最终的适当治疗。本文使用无监督学习技术对一组记忆障碍患者的电子病历进行分析，以表征该疾病人群的异质性。利用医学代码的预训练嵌入以及基于Transformer的临床BERT嵌入来对患者的电子病历进行编码。我们基于合并症和共享文本特征的存在，确定了亚群体的存在，并讨论了它们的临床意义。",
