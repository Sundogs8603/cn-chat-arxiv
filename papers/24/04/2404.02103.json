    "translated_abstract": "检索增强生成（RAG）已成为大型语言模型的热门应用。成功的RAG系统最好提供由段落支持且没有错觉的准确答案。为了构建完整的RAG管道，需要开展大量工作，同时也需要能够对性能进行基准测试。我们提出了ClapNQ，一个用于完整RAG管道的基准长格式问答数据集。ClapNQ包括具有自然问题（NQ）中基于段落的金标段落的长答案，以及一个用于执行检索、生成或完整RAG管道的语料库。ClapNQ的答案简洁，比完整段落小3倍，并且一致，包含不连续的多个段落片段。RAG模型必须适应这些特性才能在ClapNQ上取得成功。我们为ClapNQ提出了基线实验和分析，突出了仍有显著挑战的领域。",
