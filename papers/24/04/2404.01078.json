    "translated_abstract": "作为可解释人工智能（XAI）的有利工具，Shapley值已被广泛用于解释基于深度学习的预测模型。然而，由于计算负载随着输入特征的增加呈指数级增长，准确且高效地估计Shapley值是一项困难任务。大多数现有的加速Shapley值估计方法必须在估计准确性和效率之间做出妥协。在本文中，我们提出了EmSHAP（基于能量模型的Shapley值估计），它可以有效地近似预期Shapley贡献函数/深度学习模型在任意特征子集下给出其余特征的情况。为了确定能量模型中的提议条件分布，引入了门控循环单元（GRU），通过将输入特征映射到隐藏空间，从而消除了输入特征顺序的影响。此外，还采用了动态掩蔽方案.",
