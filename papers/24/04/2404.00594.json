While recent advances have led to automated summarization solutions for legal documents, they typically provide generic summaries, which may not meet the diverse information needs of users. To address this gap, we introduce LexAbSumm, a novel dataset designed for aspect-based summarization of legal case decisions, sourced from the European Court of Human Rights jurisdiction. We evaluate several abstractive summarization models tailored for longer documents on LexAbSumm, revealing a challenge in conditioning these models to produce aspect-specific summaries. We release LexAbSum to facilitate research in aspect-based summarization for legal domain.",

    "translated_abstract": "法律专业人士经常遇到包含对他们工作至关重要见解的长篇法律判决。尽管最近的进展已经导致了针对法律文件的自动摘要解决方案，但它们通常提供通用摘要，可能无法满足用户多样化的信息需求。为了填补这一空白，我们引入了LexAbSumm，这是一个专为源自欧洲人权法院管辖区的法律案例决策进行基于方面的摘要设计的新颖数据集。我们评估了几种针对长篇文档的抽象摘要模型在LexAbSumm上的性能，揭示了一种条件这些模型生成特定方面摘要的挑战。我们发布LexAbSumm以促进法律领域基于方面的摘要研究。",
