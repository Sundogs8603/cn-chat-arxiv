    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.01828v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated susceptibility to adversarial attacks. Adversarial defense techniques often focus on one-shot setting to maintain robustness against attack. However, new attacks can emerge in sequences in real-world deployment scenarios. As a result, it is crucial for a defense model to constantly adapt to new attacks, but the adaptation process can lead to catastrophic forgetting of previously defended against attacks. In this paper, we discuss for the first time the concept of continual adversarial defense under a sequence of attacks, and propose a lifelong defense baseline called Anisotropic \\& Isotropic Replay (AIR), which offers three advantages: (1) Isotropic replay ensures model consistency in the neighborhood distribution of new data, indirectly aligning the output preference between old and new tasks. (2) Anisotropic replay enables the model to learn a compromise data manifold with fresh mixed semantics ",

    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络已经表现出对抗性攻击的易受性。对抗性防御技术通常专注于一次性设置，以保持对抗攻击的稳健性。然而，在实际部署场景中，新的攻击可能会连续出现。因此，防御模型不断适应新的攻击是至关重要的，但适应过程可能会导致对先前进行防御的攻击的灾难性遗忘。在本文中，我们首次讨论了在一系列攻击下的持续对抗性防御的概念，并提出了一种名为各向异性与各向同性重演（AIR）的终身防御基线，具有三个优势：（1）各向同性重演确保模型在新数据的邻域分布中保持一致性，间接地对齐了旧任务和新任务之间的输出偏好。 (2) 各向异性重演使模型能够学习一个带有新混合语义的折衷数据流形",
