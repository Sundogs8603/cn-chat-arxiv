    "translated_abstract": "在最近几十年里，金融量化已迅速兴起并成熟。对于像基金、投资机构这样的金融机构，他们越来越不满于被动地构建具有平均市场回报的投资组合的情况，而是更加关注主动的量化策略投资组合。这需要引入主动股票投资基金管理模型。目前，在我国的股票基金投资市场中，有许多主动量化投资策略，所使用的算法也各不相同，如支持向量机（SVM）、随机森林（random forest）、RNN循环记忆网络等。本文关注这一趋势，以金融股票投资领域中新兴的门控长短期记忆网络模型LSTM-GRU为基础构建一套主动投资股票策略，并结合支持向量机（SVM）在该领域中的广泛应用。",
