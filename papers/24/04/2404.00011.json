Present techniques for procedurally generating adversarial texts are not robust enough for training on complex tasks such as answering multi-sentence trivia questions. We instead turn to human-generated data by introducing an interface for collecting adversarial human-written trivia questions. Our interface is aimed towards question writers and players of Quiz Bowl, a buzzer-based trivia competition where paragraph-long questions consist of a sequence of clues of decreasing difficulty. To incentivize usage, a suite of machine learning-based tools in our interface assist humans in writing questions that are more challenging to answer for Quiz Bowl players and computers alike. Not only does our interface gather training data for the groundbreaking Quiz B",

    "translated_abstract": "当开发问答人工智能时，一个关键组成部分是一个对抗数据集，挑战模型适应自然语言中复杂语法和推理。目前的程序生成对抗文本技术对于训练回答多句谜题等复杂任务的模型并不够健壮。我们转向人类生成的数据，引入了一个界面来收集对抗的人类编写的谜题。我们的界面面向问答写作者和Quiz Bowl的参与者，Quiz Bowl是一种基于蜂鸣器的谜题竞赛，其中由一系列难度递减的提示组成的段落长问题。为了激励使用，我们界面中的一套基于机器学习的工具帮助人类编写更具挑战性的问答问题，对于Quiz Bowl参与者和计算机都更难答题。我们的界面不仅收集了开创性的Quiz B的训练数据",
