The cyber risk is unhurriedly increasing day by day and it is right now a global threat. Developing countries like Bangladesh face major cyber risk challenges. The growing cyber threat worldwide focuses on the need for effective modeling to predict and manage the associated risk. This paper exhibits a Machine Learning(ML) based model for predicting individuals who may be victims of cyber attacks by analyzing socioeconomic factors. We collected the dataset from victims and non-victims of cyberattacks based on socio-demographic features. The study involved the development of a questionnaire to gather data, which was then used to measure the significance of features. Through data augmentation, the dataset was expanded to encompass 3286 entries, se",

    "translated_abstract": "网络风险指的是破坏声誉、货币损失或组织或个人的干扰风险，这种情况通常是由于对网络系统的无意识使用而导致的。网络风险每天都在逐渐增加，目前已成为全球性威胁。像孟加拉国这样的发展中国家面临着重大的网络风险挑战。全球范围内不断增长的网络威胁强调了对有效建模以预测和管理相关风险的需求。本文展示了一种基于机器学习（ML）的模型，通过分析社会经济因素来预测可能成为网络攻击受害者的个人。我们从网络攻击受害者和非受害者中收集了基于社会人口特征的数据集。该研究涉及开发问卷以收集数据，然后用于衡量特征的重要性。通过数据增强，数据集扩展到3286条记录。",
