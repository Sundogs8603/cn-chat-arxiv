    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能在各个领域的快速发展，教育行业正面临变革。AI驱动工具在增强学习体验方面的潜力是巨大的，特别是在编程领域。然而，LLMs在自动化编程评估系统(APASs)中作为AI辅导员的科学评估仍未得到充分探讨。因此，有必要了解学生如何与这些AI辅导员互动，并分析他们的体验。在本文中，我们通过将GPT-3.5-Turbo模型作为AI辅导员集成到APAS Artemis中进行了探索性案例研究。通过结合实证数据收集和探索性调查，我们确定了基于他们与AI辅导员互动模式的不同用户类型。此外，研究结果强调了诸如及时反馈和可扩展性等优势。然而，挑战如通用领域回复等也同样值得关注。",
