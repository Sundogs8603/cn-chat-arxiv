    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.02426v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The consumer store is ubiquitous and plays an important role in our everyday lives. It is an open question why stores usually have such short life cycles (typically around 3 years in China). This paper proposes a theoretical framework based on an equilibrium in style supply of stores and style demand of consumers to characterize store cash flow (revenue), leading to a strong explanation of this puzzle. In our model, we derive that the preference shifting of consumers is the main reason for the cash flow decreasing to its break-even line over time, while the visibility broadening leads to initial growth, resulting in rainbow-shaped cash flow and its life cycle. Moreover, the intensified spatial competition will lead to an unexpected decrease in the store's cash flow, or even closure. We calibrate our model with proprietary data of three Chinese stores from three representative industries and study the relationship between customers' prefe",

    "translated_abstract": "消费者店铺无处不在，在我们的日常生活中扮演着重要角色。为什么店铺通常寿命如此短暂（中国通常约为3年）是一个悬而未决的问题。本文提出了一个基于店铺风格供应和消费者风格需求平衡的理论框架，以表征店铺现金流（收入），从而强有力地解释了这一谜题。在我们的模型中，我们推导出消费者偏好转变是随时间现金流减少至盈亏平衡线的主要原因，而能见度的拓展导致初始增长，导致呈现出彩虹状现金流及其生命周期。此外，加剧的空间竞争将导致店铺现金流意外下降，甚至关闭。我们通过三个代表性行业的三家中国店铺的专有数据校准了我们的模型，并研究了顾客偏好与现金流之间的关系。",
