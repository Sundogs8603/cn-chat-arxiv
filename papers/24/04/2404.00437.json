    "translated_abstract": "自动法律文本分类系统已经被提出在文献中，以解决知识从判决中提取并检测其方面。然而，即使它们的模型是可解释的，大多数这些系统都是黑盒的。这可能引发对它们可信度的担忧。因此，本研究提出了一个系统，结合自然语言处理（NLP）和机器学习（ML），以可解释的方式对法律文本进行分类。我们分析了决策中涉及的特征和树结构的决策路径的阈值分叉值，并以自然语言的方式向用户呈现这些信息。这是第一项关于自动分析法律文本的工作，结合NLP和ML以及可解释的人工智能技术，以使模型的决策自动变得可理解给最终用户。此外，法律专家已经验证了我们的解决方案，这些知识也已",
