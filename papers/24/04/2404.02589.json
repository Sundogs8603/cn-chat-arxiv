Most recent studies analyze the dialog content for personality classification yet overlook two major concerns that hinder their performance. First, crucial implicit factors contained in conversation, such as emotions that reflect the speakers' personalities are ignored. Second, only focusing on the input dialog content disregards the semantic understanding of personality itself, which reduces the interpretability of the results.

    "translated_abstract": "对话中的人格识别（PRC）旨在通过文本对话内容识别说话者的人格特征。这对于在人机交互（HCI）的各种应用中提供个性化服务至关重要，包括基于AI的心理治疗和为老年人提供伴侣机器人。最近的研究分析对话内容进行人格分类，但忽略了影响其性能的两个主要问题。首先，对话中包含的关键隐含因素（如反映说话者人格的情绪）被忽略。其次，仅关注输入对话内容忽略了对个性本身语义理解，降低了结果的解释性。在本文中，我们提出了用于准确且可解释的PRC的情感自然语言推理（Affective-NLI）。",
