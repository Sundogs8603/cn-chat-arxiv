As an annually well-known international competition, COLIEE aims to advance the development of state-of-the-art retrieval models for legal texts. This paper elaborates on the methodology employed by the TQM team in COLIEE2024.Specifically, we explored various lexical matching and semantic retrieval models, with a focus on enhancing the understanding of case relevance. Additionally, we endeavor to integrate various features using the learning-to-rank technique. Furthermore, fine heuristic pre-processing and post-processing methods have been proposed to mitigate irrelevant information. Consequently, our methodology achieved remarkable performance in COLIEE2024, securing first place in Task 1 and third place in Task 3. We anticipate that our proposed approach can contribute valuable insights to the advancement of legal retrieval",
