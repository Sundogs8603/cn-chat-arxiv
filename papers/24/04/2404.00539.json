    "translated_abstract": "二次分配问题（QAP）是一个实际的组合优化问题，在多年来一直受到研究。由于它是NP困难的，解决QAP的大问题实例是具有挑战性的。尽管启发式方法可以找到半最优解，但随着问题规模的增加，执行时间显着增加。最近，通过深度学习解决组合优化问题比启发式算法更快的解决器引起了关注。但即使使用深度学习，解决大型QAP问题仍然具有挑战性。在本文中，我们提出了称为两阶段图指针网络（GPN）的深度强化学习模型，用于解决QAP。两阶段GPN依赖于GPN，该模型已被提出用于欧几里得旅行商问题（TSP）。首先，我们扩展GPN以用于一般TSP，然后我们向该模型添加新算法以解决QAP。我们的实验结果表明，我们的两阶段GPN提供了半最优解。",
