    "translated_abstract": "定量政策目标是气候政策的基本要素，通常以领域特定和技术性语言为特征。目前，筛选全球气候政策目标的方法涉及大量手动工作。目前很少有可扩展的方法从国家法律或政策中提取气候目标，这限制了政策制定者和研究人员评估私营和公共部门与全球目标的一致性以及为政策决策提供信息的能力。在本文中，我们提出了一种从国家法律和政策中提取气候目标提及的方法。我们创建了一个专家注释的数据集，识别了三类目标（“净零”，“减少”和“其他”（例如可再生能源目标）），并训练了一个可靠地在文本中识别它们的分类器。我们调查了与我们模型相关的偏差和公平影响，并确定了特定年份和国家名称作为问题。",
