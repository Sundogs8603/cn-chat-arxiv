However, with the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as writing assistants in everyday writing, a critical question emerges: are authors' linguistic patterns still predictive of their personal traits when LLMs are involved in the writing process? We investigate the impact of LLMs on the linguistic markers of demographic and psychological traits, specifically examining three LLMs - GPT3.5, Llama 2, and Gemini - across six different traits: gender, age, political affiliation, personality, empathy, and morality. Our findings indicate that although the use of LLMs slightly reduces the predictive power of linguistic patterns over authors' personal traits, the significant changes are infrequent, and the use of LLMs does not ",

    "translated_abstract": "先前的研究已经确定了个体语言使用与其个人特征之间的关联；我们的语言模式揭示了关于我们个性、情绪状态和信念的信息。然而，随着大型语言模型(LLMs)在日常写作中作为写作助手被越来越广泛地采用，一个关键问题出现了：当LLMs参与写作过程时，作者的语言模式是否仍然能预测其个人特征？我们研究了LLMs对人口统计特征和心理特征的语言标记的影响，具体检查了三个LLMs - GPT3.5、Llama 2和Gemini - 在六种不同特征上：性别、年龄、政治立场、个性、移情能力和道德。我们的发现表明，虽然使用LLMs略微降低了语言模式对作者个人特征的预测能力，但显著变化不太频繁，LLMs的使用并不",
