    "translated_abstract": "随着世界标记了《2015-2030年减少灾害风险差距框架》的中期，许多国家仍在努力监测其气候和灾害风险，因为大规模调查曝光和物理脆弱性分布昂贵，因此，在气候变化加剧的影响之下，这些国家在减少风险方面并不在轨道上。我们提出了使用机器学习和时间序列遥感从公开可用的Sentinel-1 SAR GRD和Sentinel-2 Harmonized MSI来映射这一重要信息的持续努力。我们引入了“OpenSendaiBench”的发展，其中包括47个国家，其中大多数是最不发达国家（LDCs），训练了ResNet-50深度学习模型，并通过映射孟加拉国达卡地区的非正式建筑的分布来展示。作为全球审计灾害风险随时间演变的开创性工作，本文旨在推进大规模区域的研究领域。",
