We propose a method where a robot receives verbal instructions, converted to text through Whisper, and a large language model (LLM) model extracts landmarks, preferred terrains, and crucial adverbs translated into speed settings for constrained navigation. A language-driven semantic segmentation model generates text-based masks for identifying landmarks and terrain types in images. By translating 2D image points to the vehicle's motion plane using camera parameters, an MPC controller can guides the vehicle towards the desired terrain. This approach enhances adaptation to diverse environments and facilitates the use of high-level instructions for navigating complex and challenging terrains.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了利用大型语言模型进行无地图越野导航的方法，使用生成式人工智能来减少传统数据收集和注释的需求。我们提出了一种方法，其中机器人接收口头指令，通过Whisper转换为文本，一个大型语言模型(LLM)提取地标、首选地形和关键副词，并将其转化为用于约束导航的速度设置。基于语言驱动的语义分割模型生成基于文本的遮罩，用于识别图像中的地标和地形类型。通过使用相机参数将2D图像点转换到车辆的运动平面，MPC控制器可以引导车辆朝向期望的地形。这一方法增强了对多样环境的适应性，促进了使用高级指令来导航复杂和具有挑战性的地形。",
