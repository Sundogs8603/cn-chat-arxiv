    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的估计程序，用于在存在空间相关性的情况下处理具有内生变量的模型，基于特征向量空间滤波。该程序被称为Moran's $I$ 2-Stage Lasso (Mi-2SL)，使用两阶段Lasso估计器，其中标准化的Moran's I 用于设置Lasso调节参数。与现有的空间计量经济方法不同，这具有一个关键优势，即不需要研究人员显式地建模空间相关性过程，这在他们仅对估计协变量的直接效应时是感兴趣的情况下是有意义的。我们展示了在已知特征向量支持（相关）集的情况下，实现一致和渐近正态参数估计所必需的条件。我们的Monte Carlo模拟结果还表明，在存在空间相关性时，Mi-2SL可以很好地与常见替代方案相抗衡。我们的实证应用复制了",
