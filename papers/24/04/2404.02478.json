    "translated_abstract": "标准的联邦学习方法在客户数据分布具有充分异质性时会受到影响。最近的方法通过个性化联邦学习（PFL）解决了客户数据异质性问题 - 一类旨在个性化学习的全局知识以更好地适应客户本地数据分布的FL算法。现有的PFL方法通常通过在特定层（即分类器头部）上执行个性化和对其余网络进行全局聚合来解耦深度神经网络的全局更新。然而，预先选择网络层进行个性化可能导致全局知识的存储不够优化。在这项工作中，我们提出了FedSelect，这是一种受到彩票票据假设中使用的迭代子网络发现过程启发的新型PFL算法。FedSelect逐步扩展子网络以个性化客户参数，并同时对剩余部分进行全局聚合。",
