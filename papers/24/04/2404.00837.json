    "translated_abstract": "人表皮生长因子受体2（HER2）是癌细胞增长中至关重要的蛋白质，标志着乳腺癌（BC）的侵略性并有助于预测其预后。对于HER2在免疫组织化学（IHC）染色组织切片中表达水平的准确评估对于治疗指导和了解癌症机制至关重要。然而，传统的由董事会认证的病理学家手动检查的工作流程面临挑战，包括观察者间和观察者内的不一致性以及延长的周转时间。在这里，我们介绍了一种利用金字塔采样的基于深度学习的方法，用于自动对IHC染色的BC组织图像中的HER2状态进行分类。我们的方法分析不同空间尺度下的形态特征，有效管理计算负荷，并促进对细胞和更大范围组织水平细节的详细检查。该方法解决了",
