It is often important to detect nodes of novel categories under such distribution shifts for safety or insight discovery purposes. We introduce a new approach, Recall-Constrained Optimization with Selective Link Prediction (RECO-SLIP), to detect nodes belonging to novel categories in attributed graphs under subpopulation shifts. By integrating a recall-constrained learning framework with a sample-efficient link prediction mechanism, RECO-SLIP addresses the dual challenges of resilience against subpopulation shifts and the effective exploitation of graph structure. Our extensive empirical evaluation across multiple graph datasets demonstrates the superior performance of RECO-SLIP over existing methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "在现实世界的图数据中，分布转移可以通过各种方式表现，例如新类别的出现和现有类别相对比例的变化。在这种分布转移下，检测属于新类别的节点对于安全或洞察发现至关重要。我们引入了一种新方法，称为具有选择性链路预测的召回约束优化（RECO-SLIP），用于在子群体转移下检测属性图中属于新类别的节点。通过将召回约束学习框架与高效样本预测机制相结合，RECO-SLIP解决了抵抗子群体转移和有效利用图结构的双重挑战。我们在多个图数据集上进行了大量实证评估，结果表明RECO-SLIP相对于现有方法具有更优异的性能。",
