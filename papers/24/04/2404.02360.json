    "translated_abstract": "识别复杂混合物中化合物的方法中，质谱的识别是一个关键步骤。传统的质谱到化合物（MS2C）问题的解决方案涉及将未知的质谱与已知的质谱-分子库进行匹配，但这种方法受限于库覆盖不完整。化合物到质谱（C2MS）模型可以通过将真实库与预测谱进行增强来提高检索率。不幸的是，许多现有的C2MS模型在预测分辨率、可扩展性或可解释性方面存在问题。我们开发了一种新的C2MS预测概率方法——FraGNNet，可以高效准确地预测高分辨率谱。FraGNNet使用结构化的潜在空间来揭示定义谱的基本过程。我们的模型在预测误差方面实现了最先进的性能，并超越了现有的C2MS模型。",
