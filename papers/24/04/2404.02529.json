    "translated_abstract": "学习辩证写作是具有挑战性的。除了语法和语法等写作基础知识外，学习者必须有意义地选择和安排论证组件，才能创造出高质量的论文。为了在计算机上支持辩证写作，必须先挖掘论证结构。当与自动论文评分相结合时，论证结构和质量分数之间的互动可以用于全面的写作支持。尽管研究已经显示利用论证结构信息进行论文评分是有用的，但迄今尚未发布带有地面事实论文质量注释的论证挖掘语料库。此外，现有语料库中没有包含特定学生撰写的论文。为了填补这一研究空白，我们提出了一个包含来自两个年龄组学生的1,320篇德语论文的语料库。每篇论文都经过人工注释，注释了其论证结构和质量。",
