    "translated_abstract": "机器人操作的一个激动人心的前沿是同时使用多个机械臂。然而，使用当前方法规划并发运动是一项具有挑战性的任务。高维复合状态空间使许多众所周知的运动规划算法变得棘手。最近，多智能体路径规划（MAPF）算法在离散2D领域表现出了潜力，提供了严格的保证。然而，MAPF中广泛使用的基于冲突的方法假定存在高效的单智能体运动规划器。这在调整这些方法以适应规划操作情况时带来了挑战，因为这一假设在这种情况下不成立，由于配置空间的高维度以及与碰撞检测相关的计算瓶颈。为此，我们提出了一种通过利用其重复性和增量性质加速冲突基搜索算法的方法，使其适用于涉及多臂协调的复杂情况。",
