    "translated_abstract": "虚假新闻的兴起使得需要有效的检测方法变得越发重要，其中包括非英语语言。该研究旨在解决孟加拉语这种被认为不太重要的语言所面临的挑战。为此，提出了一个包含约50,000条新闻项目的完整数据集。在这个数据集上测试了几种深度学习模型，包括双向门控循环单元（GRU）、长短期记忆（LSTM）、一维卷积神经网络（CNN）和混合架构。对于这项研究，我们评估了利用一系列有用指标的模型的有效性，包括召回率、精确率、F1得分和准确度。通过使用一个大型应用程序来完成这项工作。我们进行了全面试验，展示了这些模型在识别孟加拉语中的虚假新闻方面的有效性，其中双向GRU模型的准确率达到了惊人的99.16%。我们的分析突出了这些模型在孟加拉语中识别虚假新闻的重要性",
