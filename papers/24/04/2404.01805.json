Initially, we establish a baseline by training a transformer-based model for standard emotion classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We argue that not all misclassifications are of the same importance, as there are perceptual similarities among emotional classes. We thus redefine the emotion labeling problem by shifting it from a traditional classification model to an ordinal classification one, where discrete emotions are arranged in a sequential order according to their valence levels.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，文本数据中的情感检测引起了越来越多的关注，因为这对于开发富有同理心的人机交互系统至关重要。本文介绍了一种从文本中对情感进行分类的方法，该方法认可并区分了各种情感之间的多样性相似性和差异性。我们首先通过训练基于transformer的模型来为标准情感分类建立了一个基线，实现了最先进的性能。我们认为，并非所有的错分都同等重要，因为情感类别之间存在知觉相似性。因此，我们通过将情感标记问题从传统分类模型转变为序数分类模型来重新定义，其中离散的情感根据其valence水平被排列成顺序。最后，我们提出了一种在二维情感空间中执行序数分类的方法",
