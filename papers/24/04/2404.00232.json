To address these issues, this paper proposes to employ a meta-learning approach called Portfolio that improves AutoMPC's efficiency and stability by warmstarting BO. Portfolio optimizes initial designs for BO using a diverse set of configurations from previous tasks and stabilizes the tuning process by fixing initial configurations instead of selecting them randomly. Experimental results demonstrate that Portfolio outperforms the pure BO in finding desirable solutions for AutoMPC within limited computational resources on 11 nonlinear control simulation benchmarks and 1 physical underwater soft robot dataset.",

    "translated_abstract": "AutoMPC是一个自动优化数据驱动模型预测控制的Python软件包。然而，当使用纯贝叶斯优化探索大搜索空间时，可能会导致计算负担过重和不稳定。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种称为Portfolio的元学习方法，通过热启动贝叶斯优化来提高AutoMPC的效率和稳定性。Portfolio利用前一任务的多样配置集优化BO的初始设计，并通过固定初始配置而不是随机选择来稳定调节过程。实验结果表明，在11个非线性控制仿真基准和1个物理水下软体机器人数据集上，Portfolio在有限计算资源内优于纯BO寻找AutoMPC的理想解决方案。",
