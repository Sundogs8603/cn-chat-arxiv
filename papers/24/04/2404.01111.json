    "translated_abstract": "在图像压缩中，随着生成建模的最新进展，揭示了速率和感知质量（逼真度）之间存在一种权衡，其中逼真度通过输出分布与源分布的接近程度来衡量。已经表明，在许多情况下，随机编码可以更好。特别是，共同随机性的作用已被广泛研究。我们阐明了在两种逼真度约束条件下私有随机性在记忆源$X^n=(X_1,...,X_n)$压缩中的作用。接近完美逼真度约束要求输出符号$(Y_1,...,Y_n)$的联合分布与源分布在总变差距离（TVD）上任意接近。每个符号的近乎完美逼真度约束要求输出符号$Y_t$的分布与源分布之间的TVD在任意小，从而实现了一种感知质量和失真之间的权衡。",
