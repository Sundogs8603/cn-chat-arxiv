The cases raise a host of questions ranging from difficult to impossible: how to nurture a vibrant public square when a few tech giants dominate the flow of information, how social media can be at the same time free from conformist groupthink and also protected against harmful disinformation campaigns, and how government and industry can cooperate on such problems without devolving toward censorship.

    "translated_title": "超越社交媒体类比",
    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体案例不断涌向最高法院，显示出一个国家正在重新调整其与技术的基本关系。这些案例引发了一系列从困难到不可能回答的问题：当少数科技巨头主宰信息流时，如何培养一个充满活力的公共广场；社交媒体如何在免于群体思维的同时，又能抵御有害的虚假信息传播；政府和工业如何在解决这些问题时合作，而不会陷入审查制度的倒退。对于这样深刻的问题，该论文提供了一个相对谦虚的贡献 -- 即不要做什么。律师的本能总是倾向于类比，考虑以往发生的事情以及如何揭示接下来应该发生的事情。几乎总是，这是正确的选择。法律的谨慎演变保护了社会免受颠覆性改变。但几乎不总是，并且，随着社交媒体的发展，颠覆性的改变已经到来。",
    "tldr": "该论文讨论了社交媒体对社会和法律的挑战，提出了在处理这些问题时的一些不宜采取的方法。",
