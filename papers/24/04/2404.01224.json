    "translated_abstract": "帕累托集学习(PSL)是多目标优化中一个新兴研究领域，专注于训练神经网络学习从偏好向量到帕累托最优解的映射。然而，现有的PSL方法仅限于一次解决单个多目标优化问题(MOP)。面对多个MOP时，这种限制不仅导致显著的低效，而且未能利用横跨不同MOP的潜在协同效应。本文提出了一种协同帕累托集学习(CoPSL)框架，它以协同方式同时学习多个MOP的帕累托集。CoPSL采用了一个架构，包括共享和MOP特定层，其中共享层旨在协同捕捉MOP之间的公共关系，而MOP特定层处理这些关系以生成每个MOP的解集。这种协同方法使得CoPSL能够高效地...",
