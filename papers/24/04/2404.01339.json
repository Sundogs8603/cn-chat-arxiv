Recognizing this gap, we embarked on a journey to humanize machine communication, to ensure AI systems not only comprehend but also resonate. To address this shortcoming, we have designed an innovative speech synthesis pipeline. Within this framework, a cutting-edge language model introduces both human-like emotion and disfluencies in a zero-shot setting.

    "translated_abstract": "当代对话系统往往存在一个重要局限性：它们的回应缺乏人类交互的情感深度和不流畅特征。这种缺失在用户寻求更个性化和有共情的互动时尤为明显。因此，这使它们显得机械化，难以引起人类用户的共鸣。认识到这一差距，我们着手于人性化机器通信的旅程，以确保AI系统不仅理解而且共鸣。为了解决这一缺点，我们设计了一种创新的语音合成流程。在这一框架内，一种先进的语言模型在零-shot设置中引入了类似人类的情感和语言紊乱。这些复杂性通过语言模型在文本生成期间无缝集成到生成文本中，使系统更好地模仿人类语音模式，促进更直观和自然的用户互动。",
