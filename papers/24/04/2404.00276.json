The IDGE allows users to create games by issuing simple natural language instructions, which significantly lowers the barrier for game development. We approach the learning process for IDGEs as a Next State Prediction task, wherein the model autoregressively predicts in-game states given player actions. It is a challenging task because the computation of in-game states must be precise; otherwise, slight errors could disrupt the game-play. To address this, we train the IDGE in a curriculum manner that progressively increases the model's exposure to complex scenarios.

    "translated_abstract": "Instruction-Driven Game Engine (IDGE) 项目旨在通过使大型语言模型（LLM）遵循自由形式的游戏规则并自动生成游戏过程来使游戏开发民主化。IDGE允许用户通过发出简单的自然语言指令来创建游戏，从而显著降低了游戏开发的障碍。我们将IDGE的学习过程视为下一个状态预测任务，模型自回归地预测玩家行动给出的游戏状态。这是一个具有挑战性的任务，因为游戏状态的计算必须准确；否则，轻微的错误可能会破坏游戏过程。为了解决这个问题，我们以课程方式训练IDGE，逐渐增加模型对复杂场景的接触。",
