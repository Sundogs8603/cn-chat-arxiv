    "translated_abstract": "会话型推荐系统(SBRSs)在捕捉短期和动态用户偏好的核心能力方面变得极为流行。然而，大多数SBRSs主要在于最大化推荐准确度，但忽略了用户的次要偏好，从而最终导致长期的筛泡。只有少数几项工作致力于提高多样性，依赖于独特的模型设计和校准损失函数，这些方法无法轻易地适应现有的面向准确度的SBRSs。因此，提出一种既简单又有效的设计是值得的，它可以作为插件用于辅助现有的SBRSs在保持推荐准确度的同时生成更多样化的列表。在本文中，我们提出了一种端到端框架，适用于每一个现有的代表性(面向准确度)SBRS，称为多样化类别感知关注SBRS(DCA-SBRS)，以提高推荐多样性的性能。",
