    "translated_abstract": "牙齿在2D图像中的定位、分割和标注在现代牙科学中具有巨大潜力，可以增强牙科诊断、治疗规划以及口腔健康的基于人群的研究。然而，由于一些牙齿形状之间的细微差异（例如，上颌第一前磨牙和第二前磨牙）、牙齿在受试者间的位置和形状变化以及牙齿异常（例如，龋齿和缺失）的存在，通用实例分割框架效能有限。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种基于ViT的框架，名为TeethSEG，它由堆叠的多尺度聚合（MSA）模块和一个人类先验知识（APK）层组成。具体而言，为了构建这两个模块，我们设计了1) 一种独特的基于排列的上采样器，以确保高效性的同时建立清晰的分割边界，并具有2) 多头自/交叉门控层来强调特定的语义。",
