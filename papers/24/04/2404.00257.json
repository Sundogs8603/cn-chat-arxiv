    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.00257v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Because of its use in practice, open-world object detection (OWOD) has gotten a lot of attention recently. The challenge is how can a model detect novel classes and then incrementally learn them without forgetting previously known classes. Previous approaches hinge on strongly-supervised or weakly-supervised novel-class data for novel-class detection, which may not apply to real applications. We construct a new benchmark that novel classes are only encountered at the inference stage. And we propose a new OWOD detector YOLOOC, based on the YOLO architecture yet for the Open-Class setup. We introduce label smoothing to prevent the detector from over-confidently mapping novel classes to known classes and to discover novel classes. Extensive experiments conducted on our more realistic setup demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for discovering novel classes in our new benchmark.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，由于其在实践中的运用，开放世界目标检测（OWOD）受到了很多关注。挑战在于模型如何检测新类别，然后增量学习它们而不会忘记先前已知的类别。先前的方法依赖于强监督或弱监督的新类别数据用于新类别检测，这可能不适用于实际应用。我们构建了一个新的基准，其中新类别只在推断阶段遇到。我们提出了一种基于YOLO架构的新OWOD检测器YOLOOC，专门针对开放类别的设置。我们引入了标签平滑以防止检测器过于自信地将新类别映射到已知类别并发现新类别。在我们更加现实的设置上进行的大量实验表明，我们的方法在我们的新基准下发现新类别的有效性。",
