The difficulty may arise due to the presence of uncommon, underspecified, or incomplete queries. In this work, we improve the ranking performance of hard or difficult queries without compromising the performance of other queries. Firstly, we do LLM based query enrichment for training queries using relevant documents. Next, a specialized ranker is fine-tuned only on the enriched hard queries instead of the original queries. We combine the relevance scores from the specialized ranker and the base ranker, along with a query performance score estimated for each query. Our approach departs from existing methods that usually employ a single ranker for all queries, which is biased towards easy queries, which form the majority of the query distribution. In our extensive experiments on the DL-Hard dataset, we find that a p",

    "translated_abstract": "文本排序系统中一个重要问题是处理查询分布尾部的困难查询。这种困难可能源于存在不常见、未明确或不完整的查询。在这项工作中，我们通过使用相关文档对训练查询进行了基于LLM的查询扩展来提高困难查询的排序性能，而不损害其他查询的性能。首先，我们基于LLM进行查询丰富化，使用相关文档进行训练。接下来，专门的排序器仅在丰富的困难查询上进行微调，而不是在原始查询上进行微调。我们将来自专门排序器和基本排序器的相关性得分以及为每个查询估计的查询性能得分进行组合。我们的方法不同于通常对所有查询使用单个排序器的现有方法，这些方法对易查询有偏见，易查询构成查询分布的大多数。",
