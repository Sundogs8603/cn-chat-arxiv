    "translated_abstract": "现代软件工程领域正在利用人工智能（AI），特别是大型语言模型（LLM），快速发展。研究人员已经开始自动化软件开发工作流的许多部分。需求工程（RE）是一个关键阶段，通过对提出的工作范围进行多次讨论并以不同形式记录来开始软件开发周期。RE 阶段以每个单元任务的用户故事清单结束，这些用户故事是通过讨论确定的，通常在项目管理工具（如 Jira、AzurDev 等）上创建和跟踪。在这项研究中，我们利用 GPT-4.0 开发了一个名为“GeneUS”的工具，用于根据需求文档自动创建用户故事，这是 RE 阶段的产物。输出以 JSON 格式提供，为后续集成到流行项目管理工具留下可能性。分析需求文档占据着重要位置",
