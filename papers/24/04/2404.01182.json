Addressing the lack of specific datasets for food-based salt content inquiries, we develop a template-based conversational dataset. The dataset is structured to ask clarification questions to identify food items and their salt content. Our findings indicate that while fine-tuning transformer-based models on the dataset yields limited performance, the integration of Neuro-Symbolic Rules significantly enhances the system's performance. Our experiments show that by integrating neuro-symbolic rules, our system achieves an improvement in joint goal accuracy of over 20% across different data sizes compared to naively fine-tuning transformer-based models.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种对话系统，使心力衰竭患者能够查询食物中的盐含量，并帮助他们监测和减少盐的摄入量。针对食物盐含量查询缺乏特定数据集的问题，我们开发了基于模板的对话数据集。该数据集结构化地提出澄清问题，以识别食物及其盐含量。我们的研究结果表明，虽然在该数据集上微调基于Transformer的模型的性能有限，但是整合神经符号规则显著提高了系统的性能。我们的实验表明，通过整合神经符号规则，相较于天真地微调基于Transformer的模型，我们的系统在不同数据规模下实现了超过20%的联合目标准确率的改善。",
