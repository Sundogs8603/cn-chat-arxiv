    "translated_abstract": "腰椎椎间盘退变，是腰椎间盘渐进性结构性磨损，被认为在腰部疼痛中发挥重要作用，这是一个重要的全球健康关注焦点。从MR图像中自动重建腰椎几何形状，将使医学参数的快速测量成为可能，以评估腰椎状态，从而确定合适的治疗方案。现有的基于图像分割的技术通常会生成错误的分割或不适合医学参数测量的无结构点云。在这项工作中，我们提出了TransDeformer：一种新颖的基于注意力机制的深度学习方法，以高空间准确度和患者间网格对应的方式重建腰椎轮廓，并且我们还提出了一种TransDeformer的变种用于错误估计。特别是，我们设计了新的注意力模块和新的注意力公式，将图像特征和标记化的轮廓特征集成起来，用于预测...",
