While image-based methods for videos have shown impressive performance, a current limitation is that they often overlook how key timestamps are selected and cannot adjust when incorrect timestamps are identified. Moreover, they are unable to extract details relevant to the question, instead providing general descriptions of the frame. To overcome this, we design a multi-LMM agent framework that travels along the video, iteratively collecting relevant information from keyframes through interactive question-asking until there is sufficient information to answer the question. Specifically, we propose TraveLER, a model that can create a plan to \"Traverse\" through the video, ask questions about individual frames to \"Locate\" and store key info",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型多模态模型（LMMs）在视频问答方面取得了重要进展，通过利用大规模、基于图像的预训练以零样本方式以帧为单位进行处理。虽然基于图像的视频方法展现了令人印象深刻的性能，但目前的局限是它们经常忽视了如何选择关键时间戳，并且无法在确定错误时间戳时进行调整。此外，它们无法提取与问题相关的细节，而是提供帧的一般描述。为了克服这一点，我们设计了一个多重LMM代理框架，它沿着视频进行移动，通过交互式提问的方式迭代地从关键帧收集相关信息，直到获得足够的信息来回答问题。具体来说，我们提出了TraveLER，这是一个可以制定“遍历”视频计划的模型，询问关于单个帧的问题以“定位”并存储关键信息",
