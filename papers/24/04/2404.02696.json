Our approach addresses the trade-off between obfuscation and utility in data protection, quantified through logarithmic loss, also known as self-information loss. This research provides a foundational exploration into the integration of information-theoretic privacy principles with representation learning, focusing specifically on the face recognition systems. We particularly highlight the adaptability of our framework with recent advancements in face recognition networks, such as AdaFace and ArcFace.
