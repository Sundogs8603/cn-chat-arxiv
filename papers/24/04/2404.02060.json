This study introduces a specialized benchmark (LIConBench) focusing on long in-context learning within the realm of extreme-label classification. We meticulously selected six datasets with a label range spanning 28 to 174 classes covering different input (few-shot demonstration) length from 2K to 50K. Our benchmark requires LLMs to comprehend the entire input to recognize the massive label spaces to make correct prediction. We evaluate 13 long-context LLMs on our benchmarks. We find that the long-context LLMs perform relatively well under the token length of 20K and the performance benefits from utilizing the long context window. However,",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理超过32K标记的长序列方面取得了重大进展。然而，它们的性能评估主要局限在困惑度和合成任务等指标上，这可能无法充分捕捉它们在更微妙的现实场景中的能力。本研究引入了一个专门的基准（LIConBench），着重于长上下文学习，在极端标签分类领域。我们精心选择了六个数据集，其标签范围跨度为28至174类，涵盖了从2K到50K的不同输入（少量演示）长度。我们的基准要求LLMs理解整个输入，以识别庞大的标签空间以进行正确预测。我们在我们的基准上评估了13个长上下文LLMs。我们发现长上下文LLMs在标记长度为20K以下时表现相对较好，并且利用长上下文窗口会带来性能上的好处。",
