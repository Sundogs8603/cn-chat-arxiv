    "translated_abstract": "机器学习（ML）方法在工业应用中被广泛使用，通常需要大量的训练数据。然而，数据收集需要大量时间成本和对制造系统的投资，常常存在数据稀缺性。因此，在具有类似功能的多台机器之间广泛开启数据共享，以增加用于构建ML方法的数据集。然而，由于不同的工作条件，它们的数据中不可避免地存在分布不匹配，而ML方法被假设是在遵循相同分布的数据集上构建和测试的。因此，提出了一种主动数据共享（ADs）框架，以确保多台机器之间共享数据的质量。它旨在同时选择对下游任务有益的最具信息量的数据点，并减轻所有选定数据点之间的分布不匹配。所提出的方法在异常检测上得到验证。",
