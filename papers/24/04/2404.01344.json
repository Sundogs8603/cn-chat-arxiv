    "translated_abstract": "法律判决的修辞角色标注对于各种任务至关重要，如案例总结、语义搜索和论点挖掘。然而，从上下文推断句子角色、相互关联的角色、有限的带标注数据和标签不平衡等问题带来挑战。本研究引入了新颖技术，通过利用语义相似实例（邻居）的知识来增强修辞角色标注性能。我们探讨了基于推理和基于训练的方法，实现了在具有挑战性的宏F1分数上的显着改进。对于基于推理的方法，我们探讨了增强标签预测而无需重新训练的插值技术。而在基于训练的方法中，我们将原型学习与我们的新颖论述感知对比方法相结合，直接在嵌入空间上进行工作。此外，我们评估了我们方法的跨领域适用性，并展示了它们在迁移中的有效性。",
