In this paper, we tackle two key challenges in ESC: enhancing contextually relevant and empathetic response generation through dynamic demonstration retrieval, and advancing cognitive understanding to grasp implicit mental states comprehensively. We introduce Dynamic Demonstration Retrieval and Cognitive-Aspect Situation Understanding (\\ourwork), a novel approach that synergizes these elements to improve the quality of support provided in ESCs.

    "translated_abstract": "情绪支持对话（ESC）系统在提供共情互动中起着关键作用，通过理解和解决用户独特经历来帮助用户度过消极情绪状态。本文解决ESC中的两个关键挑战：通过动态演示检索增强相关语境和共情式回应生成，以及推进认知理解以全面把握隐含的心理状态。我们介绍了动态演示检索和认知方面情境理解（\\ourwork），这是一种新颖的方法，将这些元素协同起来，以提高ESC中提供的支持质量。通过利用上下文学习和人设信息，我们引入了一种创新的检索机制，选择信息丰富且个性化的演示对。我们还提出了一个认知理解模块，利用来自ATOMIC知识源的四种认知关系，以深入理解隐含的心理状态。",
