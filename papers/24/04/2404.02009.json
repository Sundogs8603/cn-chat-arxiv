    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.02009v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents the proof-of-concept of the first automatic voice assistant ever built in Wolof language, the main vehicular language spoken in Senegal. This voicebot is the result of a collaborative research project between Orange Innovation in France, Orange Senegal (aka Sonatel) and ADNCorp, a small IT company based in Dakar, Senegal. The purpose of the voicebot is to provide information to Orange customers about the Sargal loyalty program of Orange Senegal by using the most natural mean to communicate: speech. The voicebot receives in input the customer's oral request that is then processed by a SLU system to reply to the customer's request using audio recordings. The first results of this proof-of-concept are encouraging as we achieved 22\\% of WER for the ASR task and 78\\% of F1-score on the NLU task.",

    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文介绍了在塞内加尔使用的主要通用语言Wolof中建立的第一个自动语音助手的概念证明。该语音机器人是法国Orange Innovation、塞内加尔Orange（又名Sonatel）和总部位于塞内加尔达喀尔的小型IT公司ADNCorp之间合作研究项目的结果。这个语音机器人的目的是向Orange客户提供关于Orange Senegal的Sargal忠诚计划的信息，通过使用最自然的交流方式：语音。语音机器人接收客户的口头请求作为输入，然后通过SLU系统处理这些请求，使用音频记录来回复客户。该概念证明的初步结果是令人鼓舞的，我们在ASR任务上达到了22%的WER，NLU任务上达到了78%的F1分数。",
