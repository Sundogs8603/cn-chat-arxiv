In this paper, we study the effect of varying retrieval methods for several translation architectures, to better understand the interplay between these two processes. We conduct experiments in two language pairs in a multi-domain setting and consider several downstream architectures based on a standard autoregressive model, an edit-based model, and a large language model with in-context learning. Our experiments show that the choice of the retrieval technique impacts the translation scores, with variance across architectures. We also discuss the effects of increasing the number and diversity of examples, which are mostly positive across the board.",

    "translated_abstract": "检索增强神经机器翻译（RAMT）架构从记忆中检索示例，以指导生成过程。尽管在这一趋势中的大多数工作探索了利用检索示例的新方式，但上游检索步骤大多未被探索。本文研究了变化的检索方法对几种翻译架构的影响，以更好地理解这两个过程之间的相互作用。我们在多领域环境中对两种语言对进行实验，并考虑基于标准自回归模型、基于编辑的模型以及带有上下文学习的大型语言模型的几种下游架构。我们的实验表明，检索技术的选择影响了翻译得分，而在各种架构之间存在差异。我们还讨论了增加示例数量和多样性的效果，这在整体上大多是积极的。",
