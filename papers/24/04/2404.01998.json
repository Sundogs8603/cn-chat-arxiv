    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的加法图像分解技术，将图像看作由多个潜在的反光组件组成，这些组件可以通过在分解过程中调制稀疏性来简单地递归估计。我们的模型驱动的RSFNet通过将优化展开成网络层来估计这些因子，仅需要学习少量标量。由设计可解释的结果因子可以通过网络融合用于不同的图像增强任务，或以用户可控的方式直接进行组合。基于RSFNet，我们详细介绍了一个无配对或非配对监督训练的零参考低光增强（LLE）应用。我们的系统提高了标准基准测试的最新性能，并在多个其他数据集上实现了更好的泛化。我们还将我们的因子与其他任务特定的融合网络集成，用于去雨、去模糊和去雾等应用。",
