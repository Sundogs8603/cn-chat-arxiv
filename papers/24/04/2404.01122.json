In the Indian context, the difficulty is further exacerbated because of the monsoon intra seasonal oscillations, which introduce significant variability in rainfall patterns over short periods. Earlier investigations into rainfall prediction leveraged numerical weather prediction methods, along with statistical and deep learning approaches. This study introduces deep learning spatial model aimed at enhancing rainfall prediction accuracy on a finer scale. In this study, we hypothesize that integrating physical understanding improves the precipitation prediction skill of deep learning models with high precision for finer spatial scales, such as cities. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a physics informed ConvLSTM2D model to predict precipitation 6hr and 12hr ahead for M",

    "translated_abstract": "在热带地区预测降雨具有挑战性，由于大气行为复杂、湿度高，且对流性降雨事件普遍存在。在印度的背景下，降雨预测的困难进一步加剧，因为季风季节性振荡会在短期内引入显著的降雨模式变化。本研究引入了深度学习空间模型，旨在提高较细尺度的降雨预测准确性。研究假设融合物理理解可以提高具有较高精度的深度学习模型对较细尺度（如城市）的降水预测能力。为了测试这一假设，我们介绍了一种物理信息的ConvLSTM2D模型，用于预测孟买城市未来6小时和12小时的降水。",
