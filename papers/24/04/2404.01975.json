    "translated_abstract": "空气质量估计可以为没有空气质量监测站的目标区域提供空气质量，对公众有用。 已有的空气质量估计方法将研究区域划分为不相交的网格区域，并应用二维卷积来根据地理学的第一定律模拟相邻网格区域的空间依赖关系，但未能模拟远距离网格区域的空间依赖关系。 为此，我们提出了一种用于区域空气质量估计的双视图超网格感知图神经网络（DSGNN），可以从双视图（即，卫星获取的气溶胶光学厚度（AOD）和气象学）模拟远距离网格区域的空间依赖关系。 具体来说，利用图像来表示区域数据（即，AOD数据和气象数据）。 引入双视图超网格学习模块以参数化方式生成超网格。 基于双视图超网格，双视图隐性相关性",
