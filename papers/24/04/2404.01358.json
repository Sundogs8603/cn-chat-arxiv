To promptly detect overlooked ASEs, we developed a digital health methodology capable of analyzing massive public data from social media, published clinical research, manufacturers' reports, and ChatGPT. We uncovered ASEs associated with the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), a market expected to grow exponentially to $133.5 billion USD by 2030. Using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model, our method successfully detected 21 potential ASEs overlooked upon FDA approval, including irritability and numbness. Our data-analytic approach revolutionizes the detection of unreported ASEs associated with newly deployed drugs, leveraging cutting-edge AI-driven social media analytics.

    "translated_abstract": "药物的不良副作用（ASEs）在FDA批准后被发现，对患者安全构成威胁。为了及时发现被忽视的ASEs，我们开发了一种数字健康方法，能够分析来自社交媒体、已发表的临床研究、制造商报告和ChatGPT等大量公开数据。我们发现了与肝素样肽1受体激动剂（GLP-1 RA）相关的ASEs，这一市场预计到2030年将呈指数增长至1335亿美元。利用命名实体识别（NER）模型，我们的方法成功检测出FDA批准时被忽视的21种潜在ASEs，包括易怒和麻木感。我们的数据分析方法彻底改变了对新部署药物相关未报告的ASEs的检测，利用前沿的人工智能驱动社交媒体分析。它可以通过释放社交媒体的力量来支持监管机构和制造商在市场上增加新药的安全性。",
