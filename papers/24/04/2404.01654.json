The existing assessment method for PD is usually the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) to assess the severity of various types of motor symptoms and disease progression. However, manual assessment suffers from high subjectivity, lack of consistency, and high cost and low efficiency of manual communication. We want to use a computer vision based solution to capture human pose images based on a camera, reconstruct and perform motion analysis using algorithms, and extract the features of the amount of motion through feature engineering. The proposed approach can be deployed on different smartphones, and the video recording and artificial intelligence analysis can be done quickly and easily through our APP.",

    "translated_abstract": "帕金森氏病（PD）是第二常见的神经退行性疾病。现有的PD评估方法通常采用运动障碍协会-统一帕金森病评分量表（MDS-UPDRS）来评估各种类型的运动症状严重程度和疾病进展。然而，手动评估存在主观性高、缺乏一致性、手动沟通成本高和效率低等问题。我们希望使用基于计算机视觉的解决方案，通过摄像头捕捉人体姿势图像，利用算法重建并进行运动分析，并通过特征工程提取运动量特征。提出的方法可以部署在不同的智能手机上，通过我们的应用程序，可以快速轻松地进行视频录制和人工智能分析。",
