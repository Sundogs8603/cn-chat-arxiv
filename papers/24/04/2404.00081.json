    "translated_abstract": "深度生成模型，如生成对抗网络（GANs），已被应用于药物发现中$de~novo$分子生成。大多数先前的研究使用强化学习（RL）算法，特别是蒙特卡罗树搜索（MCTS），来处理GANs中分子表示的离散特性。然而，由于GANs和RL模型的固有训练不稳定性，以及与MCTS采样相关的高计算成本，MCTS RL-based GANs难以扩展到大型化学数据库。为了解决这些挑战，本研究提出了一种基于带即时和全局奖励的演员-评论家RL的新型GAN，称为InstGAN，以在令牌级别上生成具有多属性优化的分子。此外，最大化信息熵被利用来缓解模式崩溃。实验结果表明，InstGAN优于其他基线，达到了可比较的性能。",
