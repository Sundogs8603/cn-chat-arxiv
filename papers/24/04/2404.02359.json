This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions.

    "translated_abstract": "多模态机器学习近年来受到广泛关注，因为它能整合多个模态的信息以增强学习和决策过程。然而，通常观察到单模态模型优于多模态模型，尽管后者可以访问更丰富的信息。此外，单个模态的影响常常主导决策过程，导致性能不佳。这个研究项目旨在通过提出一种新颖的正则化项来解决这些挑战，该项鼓励多模态模型在做出决策时有效利用所有模态的信息。该项目的重点在于视频-音频领域，尽管所提出的正则化技术在涉及多个模态的体现AI研究中具有广泛应用前景。通过利用这种正则化项，提出的方法",
