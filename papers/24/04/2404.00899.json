    "translated_abstract": "随着大型语言模型（LLMs）生成的文本日益普及，人们越来越关注区分LLM生成的文本和人工撰写的文本，以防止LLM的滥用，如误导性信息的传播和学术不诚实行为。过去的研究主要集中于将文本分类为完全由人类撰写或由LLM生成，忽略了同时包含两种内容类型的混合文本的检测。本文探讨了LLM识别人类撰写和机器生成混合文本中边界的能力。我们将这一任务转化为一个标记分类问题，并将标记转折点视为边界。值得注意的是，我们的LLM集成模型在SemEval'24竞赛任务8中的‘人机混合文本检测’子任务中获得第一名。此外，我们研究了影响LLMs在检测中的能力的因素。",
