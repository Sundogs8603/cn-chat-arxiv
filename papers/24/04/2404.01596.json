    "translated_abstract": "运动预测对于自主越野驾驶至关重要，但与在道路上驾驶相比，它面临着更多挑战，主要是由于车辆与地形之间复杂的相互作用。传统的基于物理的方法在准确建模动态系统和外部干扰方面遇到困难。相反，基于数据驱动的神经网络需要大量数据集，并且难以明确捕捉基本的物理定律，这很容易导致泛化能力差。通过融合这两种方法的优势，神经符号方法提出了一个有前途的方向。这些方法将物理定律嵌入神经模型中，可能显著提高泛化能力。然而，以往的研究都没有在现实世界的越野驾驶环境中进行评估。为了弥合这一差距，我们提出 PhysORD，这是一种神经符号方法，集成了守恒定律，即欧拉-拉格朗日方程。",
