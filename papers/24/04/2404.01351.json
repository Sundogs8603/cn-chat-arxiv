    "translated_abstract": "测试时适应（TTA）已经成为一种可行的解决方案，利用无标签测试数据来使预训练模型适应领域偏移。然而，TTA面临着适应失败的挑战，因为在动态场景中它依赖于对未知测试样本的盲目适应。传统的用于评估检测性能的方法在TTA背景下受到限制，因为它们对于无标签数据或重新训练模型有着不切实际的假设。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了AETTA，一个用于TTA的无标签准确性估计算法。我们提出了预测不一致性作为准确性估计，通过比较目标模型预测和dropout推断来计算。然后，我们改进了预测不一致性以扩展AETTA在适应失败下的适用性。我们对四个基线和六种TTA方法进行了广泛评估，结果显示AETTA相比于其他方法平均提高了19.8%的准确性估计。",
