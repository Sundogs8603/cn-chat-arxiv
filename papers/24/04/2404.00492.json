    "translated_abstract": "在大语言模型时代，多跳问题回答 (MQA) 在知识编辑 (KE) 下引起了广泛关注。然而，现有的MQA在处理包含显式时间背景的问题时表现不佳。为了解决这一限制，我们提出了一个新颖的框架，即时态知识增强的多跳问题回答 (TEMPLE-MQA)。不同于以往的方法，TEMPLE-MQA首先构建一个时间感知图 (TAG)，以结构化方式存储编辑知识。然后，通过我们提出的推理路径、结构检索和联合推理阶段，TEMPLE-MQA有效地识别问题查询中的时间背景。对基准数据集的实验表明，TEMPLE-MQA显著优于基线模型。此外，我们贡献了一个新数据集，名为TKEMQA，专门为带有时间约束的MQA量身定制，作为首个基准。",
