SDoH are frequently studied in the Electronic Health Record (EHR), which provides a rich repository for diverse patient data. In this work, we present a novel annotated corpus, the Pediatric Social History Annotation Corpus (PedSHAC), and evaluate the automatic extraction of detailed SDoH representations using fine-tuned and in-context learning methods with Large Language Models (LLMs). PedSHAC comprises annotated social history sections from 1,260 clinical notes obtained from pediatric patients within the University of Washington (UW) hospital system. Employing an event-based annotation scheme, PedSHAC captures ten distinct health determinants to encompass living and economic stability, prior trauma, education access, substance use history, and mental health with",

    "translated_abstract": "健康的社会决定因素(SDoH)在塑造健康结果中起着至关重要的作用，特别是在儿科人群中，干预措施可能具有长期影响。SDoH经常在电子健康记录(EHR)中进行研究，EHR为多样化的患者数据提供了丰富的库。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新颖的带注释语料库，儿科社会史注释语料库(PedSHAC)，并评估使用大型语言模型(LLMs)的微调和上下文学习方法自动提取详细的SDoH表征。PedSHAC包括来自华盛顿大学(UW)医院系统内的1,260份临床记录中注释的社会史节。采用事件为基础的注释方案，PedSHAC捕捉了十个不同的健康决定因素，涵盖了生活和经济稳定性，以前的创伤，教育获取，物质使用史以及心理健康等内容。",
