    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.02112v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce ImageNot, a dataset designed to match the scale of ImageNet while differing drastically in other aspects. We show that key model architectures developed for ImageNet over the years rank identically when trained and evaluated on ImageNot to how they rank on ImageNet. This is true when training models from scratch or fine-tuning them. Moreover, the relative improvements of each model over earlier models strongly correlate in both datasets. We further give evidence that ImageNot has a similar utility as ImageNet for transfer learning purposes. Our work demonstrates a surprising degree of external validity in the relative performance of image classification models. This stands in contrast with absolute accuracy numbers that typically drop sharply even under small changes to a dataset.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了ImageNot，这是一个旨在与ImageNet在规模上匹配但在其他方面有着显著差异的数据集。我们展示了多年来为ImageNet开发的关键模型架构在ImageNot上训练和评估时，其排名与它们在ImageNet上的排名完全相同。无论是从头开始训练模型还是微调模型，这一点都成立。此外，每个模型相对于先前模型的改进在两个数据集中都有很强的相关性。我们进一步提供证据表明，ImageNot在迁移学习目的上具有类似的效用于ImageNet。我们的工作展示了图像分类模型相对性能的惊人外部有效性。这与通常在数据集发生小变化时甚至细微改变时绝对准确度数字会急剧下降形成对比。",
