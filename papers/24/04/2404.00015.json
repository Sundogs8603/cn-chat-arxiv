    "translated_abstract": "Quantum Kernels被认为在量子机器学习的早期阶段提供了有用性。然而，在利用庞大数据集时，高度复杂的经典模型很难超越，特别是在理解力方面。尽管如此，一旦数据稀缺且倾斜，经典模型就会遇到困难。量子特征空间被预计在这样具有挑战性的情景中能够找到更好的数据特征和目标类别之间的联系，最重要的是增强了泛化能力。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种名为Systemic Quantum Score (SQS)的新方法，并提供了初步结果，表明在金融行业生产级应用案例中，SQS可能比纯经典模型具有优势。我们的具体研究表明，SQS能够从较少的数据点中提取出模式，并且在数据需求量大的算法（如XGBoost）上表现出更好的性能，带来优势。",
