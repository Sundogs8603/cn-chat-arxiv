Unlike commonly used heavy-tailed distributions, the multivariate convolution-t distributions embody cluster structures with flexible nonlinear dependencies and heterogeneous marginal distributions. Importantly, convolution-t distributions have simple density functions that facilitate estimation and likelihood-based inference. The characteristic features of convolution-t distributions are found to be important in an empirical analysis of realized volatility measures and help identify their underlying factor structure.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一类新的多元重尾分布，这些分布是异质多元t分布的卷积。与常用的重尾分布不同，多元卷积t分布体现了具有灵活非线性依赖性和异质边缘分布的簇结构。重要的是，卷积t分布具有简单的密度函数，有助于估计和基于似然的推断。发现卷积t分布的特征在实现波动率测量的经验分析中非常重要，并有助于识别其潜在因子结构。",
