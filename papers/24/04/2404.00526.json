However, at that time, players were unaware of the significant impact that playtime could have on their feelings. This has made it challenging for designers and developers to create new games since they have to control the emotional impact that these games will take on players. Thus, the purpose of this study is to look at how a player's emotions are affected by the duration of the game. In order to achieve this goal, a framework for emotion detection is created. According to the experiment's results, the volunteers' general ability to express emotions increased from 20 to 60 minutes. In comparison to shorter gameplay sessions, the experiment found that extended gameplay sessions did significantly affect the player's emotions. According",

    "translated_abstract": "视频游戏自上世纪70年代以来一直在娱乐中发挥着至关重要的作用，在封锁期间变得更加突出，那时人们正在寻找娱乐方式。然而，当时玩家没有意识到游戏时间对他们情绪的重大影响。这使得设计师和开发人员很难创建新游戏，因为他们必须控制这些游戏对玩家情绪的影响。因此，本研究的目的是研究玩家情绪如何受到游戏持续时间的影响。为实现此目标，建立了一种情感检测框架。根据实验结果，志愿者从20分钟到60分钟的一般表达情感能力有所增加。与较短游戏时间相比，实验发现长时间游戏对玩家的情绪确实产生了显著影响。",
