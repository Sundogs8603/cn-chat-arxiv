    "translated_abstract": "随机算法可以用来加速大型数据集的分析。本文中，我们针对多元统计分析中两个最基本的问题：最小二乘和主成分分析(PCA)，开发了一种统计推断的统一方法，通过随机草图或投影来进行。该方法适用于固定数据集 -- 即数据条件性 -- 唯一的随机性源于随机算法。我们提出了一种针对广泛范围的草图分布的统计推断方法，例如子采样随机哈达玛变换(SRHT)，稀疏符号嵌入(SSE)和CountSketch，具有独立同分布的条目的草图矩阵以及均匀子采样。据我们所知，目前尚无可比较的方法适用于PCA中的SSE和SRHT。我们的新颖理论方法基于展示某些二次形式的渐近正态性。作为更广泛兴趣的贡献，我们展示了关于二次形式的中心极限定理。",
