To address this issue, we propose a new generalizable control barrier function (CBF)-based steering controller to reduce the number of samples needed in a sampling-based motion planner RRT. Our method combines the strength of CBF for real-time collision-avoidance control and RRT for long-horizon motion planning, by using CBF-induced neural controller (CBF-INC) to generate control signals that steer the system towards sampled configurations by RRT. CBF-INC is learned as Neural Networks and has two variants handling different inputs, respectively: state (signed distance) input and point-cloud input from LiDAR. In the latter case, we also study two different settings: fully and partially observed environmental information. Compared to man",

    "translated_abstract": "在拥挤环境中的机器人的基于采样的运动规划方法通常会受到昂贵的碰撞检查和高采样复杂性的困扰，这使得它们难以实时使用。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的通用控制屏障函数(CBF)为基础的转向控制器，以减少采样式运动规划器RRT中所需的样本数量。我们的方法结合了CBF用于实时避免碰撞控制的优势和RRT用于长视程运动规划的优势，通过使用CBF诱导的神经控制器(CBF-INC)生成操纵信号，将系统引导向RRT采样的配置。CBF-INC被学习为神经网络，有两个处理不同输入的变体，分别是：状态（符号距离）输入和来自LiDAR的点云输入。在后一种情况下，我们还研究了两种不同的设置：完全和部分观察的环境信息。",
