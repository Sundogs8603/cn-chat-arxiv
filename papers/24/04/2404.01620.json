    "translated_abstract": "在音频数据上训练的大型AI模型可能具有快速分类患者的潜力，通过早期检测增强医疗决策，并可能通过早期检测改善结果。现有技术依赖于在高收入、英语国家使用昂贵记录设备的有限数据集，这种技术面临资源受限、高收入场所的部署挑战，音频数据可能具有深远影响。本报告介绍了一种新的数据类型和相应的收集系统，通过引导问题仅使用移动应用/网络应用程序捕获健康数据。该应用程序最终产生一个音频电子健康记录（voice EHR），它可能包含来自传统语音/呼吸特征、语音模式和具有语义意义的语言的复杂生物标志物，补偿单一模态临床数据的典型限制。本报告介绍了一个合作伙伴财团",
