    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.00593v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: We introduce LAESI, a Synthetic Leaf Dataset of 100,000 synthetic leaf images on millimeter paper, each with semantic masks and surface area labels. This dataset provides a resource for leaf morphology analysis primarily aimed at beech and oak leaves. We evaluate the applicability of the dataset by training machine learning models for leaf surface area prediction and semantic segmentation, using real images for validation. Our validation shows that these models can be trained to predict leaf surface area with a relative error not greater than an average human annotator. LAESI also provides an efficient framework based on 3D procedural models and generative AI for the large-scale, controllable generation of data with potential further applications in agriculture and biology. We evaluate the inclusion of generative AI in our procedural data generation pipeline and show how data filtering based on annotation consistency results in dataset",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了LAESI，这是一个包含了10万张合成叶片图像的合成叶片数据集，每张图像都有语义分割掩模和表面积标注，图像背景是毫米纸。该数据集主要用于对山毛榉和橡树叶进行形态分析。我们通过训练机器学习模型进行叶片表面积预测和语义分割来评估数据集的适用性，使用真实图像进行验证。验证结果表明，这些模型可以训练出预测叶面积的能力，相对误差不会超过平均人类标注员的误差。LAESI还提供了一个基于3D程序模型和生成式人工智能的高效框架，可用于大规模、可控的数据生成，在农业和生物学等领域具有潜在应用。我们评估了将生成式人工智能纳入我们的程序化数据生成流程中，并展示了基于注释一致性的数据过滤如何导致数据集的生成。",
