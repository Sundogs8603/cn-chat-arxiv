Despite its relevance to almost all societies around the world, research has been limited due to the lack of available datasets and other resources. This study explores the possibility of dataset creation through crowdsourcing, utilizing non-expert annotators to develop training corpora. We first extend framing analysis beyond English news to a multilingual context (12 typologically diverse languages) through automatic translation. We also present a novel benchmark in Bengali and Portuguese on the immigration and same-sex marriage domains. Additionally, we show that a system trained on our crowd-sourced dataset, combined with other existing ones, leads to a 5.32 percentage point increase from the baseline, showing that crowdsourcing is a viable option.

    "translated_abstract": "媒体框架是指有目的地选择和呈现政治问题特定方面以塑造公众舆论的研究。尽管与全球几乎所有社会都相关，但由于缺乏可用数据集和其他资源，研究受到限制。该研究探讨通过众包进行数据集创建的可能性，利用非专家注释者开发训练语料库。我们首先通过自动翻译将框架分析扩展到多语言环境（12种类型多样的语言）。我们还在孟加拉语和葡萄牙语领域提出了一个新颖的基准，涉及移民和同性婚姻。此外，我们展示了一个在我们的众包数据集上训练的系统，结合其他现有数据集，与基线相比增加了5.32个百分点，表明众包是一个可行的选择。最后，我们研究了大型语言模型的性能。",
