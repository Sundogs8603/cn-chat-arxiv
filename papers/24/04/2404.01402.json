A successful handover requires the robot to maintain a stable grasp on the object while making sure the human receives the object in a natural and easy-to-use manner. We propose ContactHandover, a robot to human handover system that consists of two phases: a contact-guided grasping phase and an object delivery phase. During the grasping phase, ContactHandover predicts both 6-DoF robot grasp poses and a 3D affordance map of human contact points on the object. The robot grasp poses are reranked by penalizing those that block human contact points, and the robot executes the highest ranking grasp.

    "translated_abstract": "机器人向人类递送物体是许多人机协作任务中的重要一步。成功的递送需要机器人保持对物体的稳定抓取，同时确保人类以一种自然且易于使用的方式接收物体。我们提出了ContactHandover，这是一个机器人向人类递送物体的系统，包括两个阶段：接触引导的抓取阶段和物体递送阶段。在抓取阶段，ContactHandover预测机器人的6自由度抓取姿势和人类接触点在物体上的3D可供性图。机器人的抓取姿势通过惩罚那些阻碍人类接触点的姿势进行重新排序，并执行排名最高的抓取。在递送阶段，通过最大化靠近人类的接触点并最小化人类手臂关节扭矩和位移来计算机器人末端执行器姿势。我们在27种不同家用物品上评估了我们的系统，并展示了o",
