However, traditional manual assessments are expensive, subjective, and heavily dependent on observers' expertise and idiosyncratic factors, preventing teachers from getting timely and frequent feedback. Different from prior research that mostly focuses on low-inference instructional practices on a singular basis, this paper presents the first study that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to assess multiple high-inference instructional practices in two distinct educational settings: in-person K-12 classrooms and simulated performance tasks for pre-service teachers.

    "translated_abstract": "评估教学质量是教育系统改进努力的基本组成部分。然而，传统的手工评估昂贵、主观，并且严重依赖于观察者的专业知识和特殊因素，这些因素阻碍了教师及时获得频繁反馈。与之前主要关注单一低推理教学实践的研究不同，本文首次展示了利用自然语言处理（NLP）技术评估两种不同教育环境下的多种高推理教学实践的研究：面对面K-12教室和预服务教师的模拟表现任务。这也是首个应用NLP来评估被广泛认为对有特殊需求学生特别有效的教学实践的研究。我们面临NLP模型教学分析中的两个挑战，包括",
