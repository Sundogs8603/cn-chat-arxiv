    "translated_abstract": "最近，在使用大型语言模型（LLM）代理进行自动代码生成方面取得了突破性进展，使我们更接近自动软件开发的未来。然而，现有的单代理方法在生成和改进大规模复杂代码库方面存在局限，这是由于上下文长度的限制所导致的。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了自组织多代理框架（SoA），这是一种新颖的多代理框架，可以实现大规模代码的可扩展高效生成和优化。在SoA中，自组织代理独立运作，以生成和修改代码组件，同时无缝协作构建整体代码库。我们框架的一个关键特点是基于问题复杂性自动增加代理的数量，从而实现动态扩展性。这使得整体代码量可以根据代理数量无限增加，同时由每个代理管理的代码量也随之增加。",
