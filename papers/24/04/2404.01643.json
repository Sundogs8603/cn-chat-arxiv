    "translated_abstract": "传统的计算机断层扫描（CT）成像识别面临两个重要挑战：（1）每个CT扫描的分辨率和大小经常存在相当大的变异性，需要对输入尺寸和模型的适应性有严格的要求。 （2）CT扫描包含大量的超出分布范围（OOD）切片。关键特性可能仅存在于整个CT扫描的特定空间区域和切片中。我们如何有效地找出这些区域的位置？为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一种针对CT扫描的增强型空间分割特征学习（SSFL ++）框架。它旨在从整个CT扫描中滤除OOD数据，通过完全减少70％的冗余来选择关键的空间切片进行分析。同时，我们提出了一种基于核密度的切片采样（KDS）方法，以提高训练和推断阶段的稳定性，从而加快收敛速度。",
