    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文提出了一种动态研究竞赛，即追逐竞赛，在连续时间框架中，两个不对称的竞争者会付出成本来实现两个突破。这两个竞争者分为不对称的两类，一类是存在偏好的，并且已经取得了一个突破 (领先者)，而另一类是时间一致的，需要实现两个突破才能获胜(追赶者)。委托人可以在两种披露政策之间进行选择，一种是立即宣布追逐者的第一个突破 (公开追逐竞赛)，另一种是直到终点才宣布竞赛结果(隐藏的追逐竞赛)。我们完全刻画了追逐竞赛在这两种披露政策下的唯一x起点和y终点的均衡，领先者从时刻x开始工作，而追赶者在时刻y停止努力。我们进一步比较了两种披露政策下的不对称激励。",
