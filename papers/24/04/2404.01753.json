However, there needs to be more clarity when it comes to analysing multimodal tasks in multi-lingual contexts. While prior studies on sentiment analysis of tweets have predominantly focused on the English language, this paper addresses this gap by transforming an existing textual Twitter sentiment dataset into a multimodal format through a straightforward curation process. Our work opens up new avenues for sentiment-related research within the research community. Additionally, we conduct baseline experiments utilising this augmented dataset and report the findings. Notably, our evaluations reveal that when comparing unimodal and multimodal configurations, using a sentiment-tuned large language model as a text encoder performs exceptionally well.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，面向学习各种数据类型的多模态自然语言处理受到了重视。然而，在多语言环境下分析多模态任务时需要更清晰的理解。尽管先前关于推文情感分析的研究主要集中在英语上，但本文通过简单的整理过程将现有的文本推特情感数据集转换为多模态格式，从而填补了这一空白。我们的工作为研究社区内与情感相关的研究开辟了新的途径。此外，我们利用这个增强数据集进行基准实验并报告了研究结果。值得注意的是，我们的评估结果显示，当比较单模态和多模态配置时，使用情感调整的大型语言模型作为文本编码器表现出色。",
