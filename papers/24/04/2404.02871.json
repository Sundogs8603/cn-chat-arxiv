The analysis covers both finite and infinite time horizons, and the mean-field interaction of the representative company with a mass of identical and indistinguishable firms is modeled through the time-dependent price at which the produced good is sold. At equilibrium, this price is given in terms of a nonlinear function of the expected (optimally controlled) production capacity of the representative company at each time. The proof of the existence and uniqueness of the mean-field equilibrium relies on a priori estimates and the study of nonlinear integral equations, but employs different techniques for the finite and infinite horizon cases. Additionally, we investigate the deterministic counterpart of the mean-field game under study.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们建立了一个关于最优投资的随机均场博弈的均衡存在性和唯一性。分析涵盖了有限和无限时间范围，代表公司与大量相同和不可区分的公司群体之间的均场相互作用通过生产商品的售价进行建模。在均衡状态下，这个价格以代表公司的预期(最优控制)生产能力的非线性函数来表示。均场均衡存在性和唯一性的证明依赖于先验估计和非线性积分方程的研究，但对于有限和无限时间范围的情况采用了不同的技术。此外，我们还研究了所讨论的均场博弈的确定性对应物。",
