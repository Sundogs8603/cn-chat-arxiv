Information on staging is often included in unstructured form in clinical, pathology, radiology and other free-text reports in the electronic health record system, requiring extensive work to parse and obtain. To facilitate the extraction of this information, previous NLP approaches rely on labeled training datasets, which are labor-intensive to prepare. In this study, we demonstrate that without any labeled training data, open-source clinical large language models (LLMs) can extract pathologic tumor-node-metastasis (pTNM) staging information from real-world pathology reports. Our experiments compare LLMs and a BERT-based model fine-tuned using the labeled data. Our findings suggest that while LLMs still exhibit subpar performance in Tumor (T) classification, with the appropriate adoption of prompting strategies, they can achi",

    "translated_abstract": "癌症分期分类对于为肿瘤学患者制定治疗和护理管理计划至关重要。分期信息通常以非结构化形式包含在临床、病理学、放射学和其他自由文本报告中，需要大量工作来解析和获取。为了促进这些信息的提取，先前的自然语言处理方法依赖于标记的训练数据集，这些数据集准备起来需要大量的人力。本研究展示了在没有任何标记的训练数据的情况下，开源的临床大型语言模型（LLMs）可以从真实病理报告中提取病理性肿瘤-淋巴结-转移（pTNM）分期信息。我们的实验比较了LLMs和使用标记数据进行微调的基于BERT的模型。我们的发现表明，虽然LLMs在肿瘤（T）分类方面仍然表现不佳，但通过适当采用提示策略，它们可以实现",
