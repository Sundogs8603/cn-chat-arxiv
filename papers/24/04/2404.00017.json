    "translated_abstract": "我们检验人工智能（AI）系统是否生成真正新颖的想法，而不仅仅是在训练期间学习到的模式。利用一种新颖的实验设计，我们让一个AI生成虚构的众筹活动项目标题。我们比较AI生成的项目标题内部，衡量重复性和复杂性。我们利用一种扩展的最大均值差异方法，在AI生成的标题和实际观测的现场数据之间进行比较，该方法是从将统计分布的核均值嵌入应用到高维机器学习（大语言）嵌入向量中推导出来的--从而得到对AI输出新颖性的结构化分析。结果表明：（1）即使在任务复杂性增加，并且在计算能力的极限下，AI也会生成独特内容，（2）生成的内容具有表面有效性，与送入其他生成AI的输入一致。",
