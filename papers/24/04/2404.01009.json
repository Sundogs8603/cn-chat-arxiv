    "translated_abstract": "在印度尼西亚，本地语言在文化中扮演着重要角色。然而，现有的印尼语言资源仍然属于自然语言处理领域的有限数据。当为这些语言构建NLP模型时，这就成为一个问题。为了填补这一空白，我们引入了Bhinneka Korpus，一个包含五种印尼本地语言的多语言平行语料库。我们的目标是增强这些资源的访问和利用，扩展它们在国内的影响力。我们详细说明了数据集收集过程及相关挑战。此外，由于数据限制，我们尝试使用IBM Model 1进行翻译任务实验。结果显示，每种语言的性能已经显示出进一步发展的良好迹象。我们讨论了诸如词汇变异、平滑效应和跨语言变异等挑战。我们打算评估该语料库...",
