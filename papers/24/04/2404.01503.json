    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.01503v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The ability to generate multiple plans is central to using planning in real-life applications. Top-quality planners generate sets of such top-cost plans, allowing flexibility in determining equivalent ones. In terms of the order between actions in a plan, the literature only considers two extremes -- either all orders are important, making each plan unique, or all orders are unimportant, treating two plans differing only in the order of actions as equivalent. To allow flexibility in selecting important orders, we propose specifying a subset of actions the orders between which are important, interpolating between the top-quality and unordered top-quality planning problems. We explore the ways of adapting partial order reduction search pruning techniques to address this new computational problem and present experimental evaluations demonstrating the benefits of exploiting such techniques in this setting.",

    "translated_abstract": "生成多个计划的能力对于在现实应用中使用规划是至关重要的。高质量规划器生成一组顶级成本计划，允许灵活确定等效计划。论文提出了在计划中行动顺序方面，文献只考虑两个极端 -- 要么所有顺序重要，使得每个计划都是唯一的，要么所有顺序都不重要，将只在行动顺序上不同的两个计划视为等效。为了允许在选择重要顺序时灵活性，我们提出指定一子集行动，其中顺序重要，插值于高质量和无序高质量规划问题之间。我们探讨了如何调整部分顺序减少搜索修剪技术以解决这一新的计算问题，并提出了实验评估，展示了在这种情况下利用这些技术的好处。",
