A few-shot online continual learning (FS-OCL) setting has been proposed to address more realistic scenarios where robots must learn from a non-repeated sparse data stream. To enable truly autonomous life-long learning, an additional challenge of detecting novelties and learning new items without supervision needs to be addressed.

    "translated_abstract": "人类和动物在他们一生中从有限的感知数据中学习，既有监督也有无监督。未来的自主智能机器人通常也被期望能做到同样。现有的持续学习方法通常不直接适用于机器人设置：它们通常需要缓冲和平衡重放训练数据。提出了少样本在线持续学习（FS-OCL）设置，以解决更真实的场景，即机器人必须从不重复的稀疏数据流中学习。为了实现真正的自主终身学习，需要解决一个额外的挑战，即检测新颖性并在无监督的情况下学习新项目。我们用称为持续学习原型（CLP）的新基于原型的方法来解决这一挑战。除了能够进行FS-OCL学习之外，CLP还能检测新颖对象并在无监督的情况下学习它们。",
