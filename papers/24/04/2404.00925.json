    "translated_abstract": "Sign Language Translation (SLT)是一项具有挑战性的任务，旨在将手语视频翻译为口头语言。受训练于广泛多语言文本语料库的大型语言模型（LLMs）强大的翻译能力的启发，我们旨在利用现成的LLMs来处理SLT。本文对手语视频进行正则化，使其具有口头语言的语言特征，并提出了一种新颖的SignLLM框架，将手语视频转换为类似语言的表示，以便现成的LLMs更易读地处理。SignLLM包括两个关键模块：（1）矢量量化视觉手语模块将手语视频转换为一系列离散的字符级手语标记，（2）码本重建和对齐模块使用最优传输公式将这些字符级标记转换为单词级手语表示。手语文本对齐损失进一步弥合了手语和文本之间的差距。",
