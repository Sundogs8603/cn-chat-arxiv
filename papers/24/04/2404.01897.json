    "translated_abstract": "连续图神经网络（CGNNs）因引入连续动力学而引起了极大关注，能够推广现有的离散图神经网络（GNNs）。它们通常受扩散类方法启发，引入了一种新颖的传播方案，并使用常微分方程（ODE）进行分析。然而，CGNNs的实现需要大量计算能力，这使得它们难以部署在电池供电设备上。受最近脉冲神经网络（SNNs）的启发，SNNs模拟生物推理过程并提供一种节能的神经架构，我们将SNNs与CGNNs结合到一个统一框架中，命名为连续脉冲图神经网络（COS-GNN）。我们在每个时间步骤使用SNNs进行图节点表示，这些表示进一步与时间一起集成到ODE过程中，以增强信息保存和缓解...",
