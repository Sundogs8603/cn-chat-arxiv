    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.02710v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce the Alternating Reading Task (ART) Corpus, a collection of dyadic sentence reading for studying the entrainment and imitation behaviour in speech communication. The ART corpus features three experimental conditions - solo reading, alternating reading, and deliberate imitation - as well as three sub-corpora encompassing French-, Italian-, and Slovak-accented English. This design allows systematic investigation of speech entrainment in a controlled and less-spontaneous setting. Alongside detailed transcriptions, it includes English proficiency scores, demographics, and in-experiment questionnaires for probing linguistic, personal and interpersonal influences on entrainment. Our presentation covers its design, collection, annotation processes, initial analysis, and future research prospects.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了交替阅读任务（ART）语料库，这是一个用于研究语音交流中对位和模仿行为的双人句子阅读集合。ART语料库包括三种实验条件 - 单独阅读、交替阅读和蓄意模仿 - 以及包含法语、意大利语和斯洛伐克口音英语的三个子语料库。该设计允许在受控和不那么自发的环境中系统地研究语音对位。除了详细的转录外，还包括英语熟练度评分、人口统计学数据和实验中的问卷，用于探究对位现象受语言、个人和人际因素的影响。我们的介绍涵盖了其设计、收集、标注过程、初步分析以及未来研究展望.",
