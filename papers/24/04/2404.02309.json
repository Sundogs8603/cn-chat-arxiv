    "translated_abstract": "最近，围绕生成AI的突破性进展引起了一波关注，导致了一系列诉讼，包括对Stability AI和OpenAI的重大行动。法律不确定性的这种情况引发了对内容创作者和发布者保护其在网络上知识产权的权利的广泛讨论。欧洲和美国的法律已经提供了大致的指导方针，为调节网络数据使用的技术解决方案指明了方向。在这个过程中，研究人员和实践者已经致力于众多网络标准和选择退出格式，使出版商有能力将他们的数据排除在生成AI模型的发展之外。新兴的AI/ML选择退出协议在数据主权方面具有价值，但同时，对于被最近诸多临时标准所淹没的网站所有者来说，这又创造了一种不利的局面。在我们的工作中，我们希望调查不同的网站",
