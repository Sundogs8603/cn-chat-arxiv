In order to increase re-usability of existing eye-tracking datasets for more diverse and initially not considered use cases, this work advocates a new approach of sharing eye-tracking data. Instead of publishing filtered and pre-processed datasets, the eye-tracking data at all pre-processing stages should be published together with data quality reports. In order to transparently report data quality and enable cross-dataset comparisons, we develop data quality reporting standards and metrics that can be automatically applied to a dataset, and integrate them into the open-source Python package pymovements (https://github.com/aeye-lab/pymovements).",

    "translated_abstract": "Eye-tracking datasets通常以它们的创建者用于原始分析的格式共享，通常会导致排除被认为与主要目的无关的数据。为了增加现有眼动数据集的可重复使用性，以满足更多样化和最初不被考虑的用例，本文主张一种新的眼动数据共享方法。与其发布经过滤和预处理的数据集，应该公布所有预处理阶段的眼动数据，并附带数据质量报告。为了透明地报告数据质量并实现跨数据集比较，我们开发了数据质量报告标准和度量标准，可以自动应用于数据集，并将其集成到开源Python软件包pymovements中（https://github.com/aeye-lab/pymovements）。",
