We first captured labeled triaxial acceleration readings for different daily human activities from the smartphone's embedded accelerometer. These readings were preprocessed using a median filter. 42 features were extracted using various methods. We then tested various machine learning algorithms along with dimensionality reduction. Finally, in our Android application, we used the machine learning algorithm and a subset of features that provided maximum accuracy and minimum model building time. This is used for real-time activity recognition and calculation of calories burnt using a formula based on Metaboli",
