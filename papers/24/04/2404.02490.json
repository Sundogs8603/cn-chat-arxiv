This paper shows that cross-lingual word representation in low-resource languages is notably under-aligned with that in high-resource languages in current models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework that explicitly aligns words between English and eight low-resource languages, utilizing off-the-shelf word alignment models. This framework incorporates three primary training objectives: aligned word prediction and word translation ranking, along with the widely used translation ranking. We evaluate our approach through experiments on the bitext retrieval task, which demonstrate substantial improvements on sentence embeddings in low-resource languages.

    "translated_abstract": "跨语言句子嵌入的研究最近取得了显著进展，但由于平行语料库的稀缺，针对低资源语言的研究落后。本文表明目前模型中低资源语言的跨语言词表示与高资源语言明显不匹配。为解决这一问题，我们引入了一个新颖的框架，明确地在英语和八种低资源语言之间对齐单词，利用现成的词对齐模型。该框架包含三个主要的训练目标：对齐单词预测和单词翻译排序，以及广泛使用的翻译排序。我们通过对双文本检索任务的实验评估了我们的方法，结果显示在低资源语言的句子嵌入方面取得了显著的改进。此外，所提出模型在更广泛范围内表现出竞争力。",
