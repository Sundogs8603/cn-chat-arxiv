Detecting such abusive content can enable platforms to curb this menace. We participated in the Gendered Abuse Detection in Indic Languages shared task at ICON2023 that provided datasets of annotated Twitter posts in English, Hindi and Tamil for building classifiers to identify gendered abuse. Our team CNLP-NITS-PP developed an ensemble approach combining CNN and BiLSTM networks that can effectively model semantic and sequential patterns in textual data. The CNN captures localized features indicative of abusive language through its convolution filters applied on embedded input text. To determine context-based offensiveness, the BiLSTM analyzes this sequence for dependencies among words and phrases. Multiple variations were trained using FastText and GloVe word embeddings for each languag",

    "translated_abstract": "在线性别骚扰是一个广泛存在的问题，限制了女性和边缘性别在数字空间中的自由表达和参与。检测这类滥用内容可以帮助平台遏制这一祸害。我们参加了 ICON2023 的Indic语言中的性别虐待检测的共享任务，该任务提供了在英语、印地语和泰米尔语中进行分类以识别性别虐待的Twitter帖子的标注数据集。我们的团队CNLP-NITS-PP开发了一个结合了CNN和BiLSTM网络的集成方法，可以有效地对文本数据中的语义和顺序模式进行建模。卷积滤波器在嵌入输入文本上应用，CNN捕获指示滥用语言的局部特征。为了确定基于上下文的冒犯性，BiLSTM分析这个序列以了解单词和短语之间的依赖关系。为每种语言使用了FastText和GloVe词嵌入进行了多个变体的训练。",
