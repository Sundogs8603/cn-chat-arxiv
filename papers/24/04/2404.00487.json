We argue that integrating behavioral sensing in LLMs will likely lead to a new frontier in AI. In this Late-Breaking Work paper, we discuss the MindScape contextual journal App design that uses LLMs and behavioral sensing to generate contextual and personalized journaling prompts crafted to encourage self-reflection and emotional development. We also discuss the MindScape study of college students based on a preliminary user study and our upcoming study to assess the effectiveness of contextual AI journaling in promoting better well-being on college campuses. MindScape represents a new application class that embeds behavioral intelligence in AI.",

    "translated_abstract": "MindScape旨在研究将时间序列行为模式（如对话参与度、睡眠、位置）与大型语言模型（LLMs）相结合，创建一种新形式的上下文智能日志，促进自我反思和幸福感。我们认为在LLMs中整合行为感知很可能会引领人工智能的新领域。在这篇晚报告工作论文中，我们讨论了MindScape上下文日志应用的设计，该应用利用LLMs和行为感知生成上下文化和个性化的日志提示，旨在鼓励自我反思和情感发展。我们还讨论了基于初步用户研究的MindScape对大学生的研究，以及我们即将展开的研究，评估上下文智能日志在促进大学校园中更好幸福感方面的有效性。MindScape代表了一种新的应用类别，将行为智能嵌入到人工智能中。",
