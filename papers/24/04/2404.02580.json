    "translated_abstract": "优化深度学习模型需要大量注释图像，这个过程既耗时又昂贵。特别是对于每个像素都必须进行注释的语义分割模型。缓解注释工作量的一个潜在策略是主动学习。主动学习有助于从大量未标记的图像中识别和选择最具信息量的图像。基本假设是，这些选定的图像可以比随机选择更快地改善模型性能，从而减少注释工作。虽然主动学习在Cityscapes等基准数据集上已经展示了有希望的结果，但在农业领域的表现仍未得到充分探索。本研究通过对三种基于主动学习的采集函数进行比较研究来填补这一研究空白：基于不一致的贝叶斯主动学习（BALD）、基于随机的BALD (PowerBALD) 和随机选择。",
