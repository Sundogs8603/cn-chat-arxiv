However, the development of evidence-based active transportation planning and policies has been impeded by significant data limitations, such as biases in crowdsourced data and representativeness issues of mobile phone data. In this study, we develop and apply a machine learning based modeling approach for estimating daily walking and cycling volumes across a large-scale regional network in New South Wales, Australia that includes 188,999 walking links and 114,885 cycling links. The modeling methodology leverages crowdsourced and mobile phone data as well as a range of other datasets on population, land use, topography, climate, etc. The study discusses the unique challenges and limitations related to all three aspects of model training, testing, and inference given the large geographical extent of the modeled networks and relative scarcity",

    "translated_abstract": "步行和骑行被认为可以带来显著的健康、环境和经济优势。然而，基于证据的积极交通规划和政策的发展受到数据限制的阻碍，例如众包数据的偏见和手机数据的代表性问题。在这项研究中，我们开发并应用了基于机器学习的建模方法，用于估算澳大利亚新南威尔士州一个包含188,999个步行链接和114,885个骑行链接的大规模地区网络的日常步行和骑行量。建模方法利用了众包和手机数据以及人口、土地利用、地形、气候等一系列其他数据集。该研究讨论了与模型训练、测试和推断的三个方面相关的独特挑战和限制，考虑到建模网络的大地理范围和相对稀缺的情况。",
