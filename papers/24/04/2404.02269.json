    "translated_abstract": "我们调查了ChatGPT在从合同中提取规范方面的有效性。规范提供了一种自然的方式来通过捕捉如何管理两个或多个自治方之间的交互来设计多主体系统。我们从合同中提取承诺、禁止、授权和权力等规范，以及相关的规范要素（涉及的当事方、前因和后果）。我们的研究揭示了ChatGPT在从合同中提取规范方面的有效性和局限性。ChatGPT展示了在提取规范方面的良好表现，而无需进行训练或微调，因此无需标记数据，而这在该领域通常是不可用的。然而，我们发现了ChatGPT在提取这些规范方面的一些限制，导致了错误的规范提取。这些限制包括对关键细节的忽视、臆想、对连接词的错误解析以及空规范要素。",
