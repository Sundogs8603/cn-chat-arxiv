This pilot study makes the first step towards a gaze-independent speller based on the code-modulated visual evoked potential (c-VEP). Participants were presented with two bi-laterally located stimuli, one of which was flashing, and were tasked to attend to one of these stimuli either by directly looking at the stimuli (overt condition) or by using spatial attention, eliminating the need for eye movement (covert condition). The attended stimuli were decoded from electroencephalography (EEG) and classification accuracies of 88% and 100% were obtained for the covert and overt conditions, respectively.

    "translated_abstract": "脑机接口（BCI）拼写器的一个局限性在于它们要求用户能够移动眼睛注视目标。对于无法自愿控制眼睛移动的用户（例如患有晚期肌萎缩侧索硬化症（ALS）的人群），这会造成问题。这项试验性研究首次迈出了朝向基于代码调制视觉诱发电位（c-VEP）的无需凝视的拼写器的第一步。参与者被呈现两个双侧位置的刺激，其中一个在闪烁，并被要求专注于这些刺激中的一个，可以通过直接看着刺激（明显条件）或使用空间注意力来完成，消除了眼球移动的需要（隐蔽条件）。被专注的刺激从脑电图（EEG）中解码，隐蔽和明显条件的分类准确率分别为88%和100%。这些基础性见解展示了这一技术的前景。",
