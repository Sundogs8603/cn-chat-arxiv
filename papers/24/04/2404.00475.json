This paper characterizes auction formats that are shill-proof: a profit-maximizing seller has no incentive to submit any shill bids. We distinguish between strong shill-proofness, in which a seller with full knowledge of bidders' valuations can never profit from shilling, and weak shill-proofness, which requires only that the expected equilibrium profit from shilling is nonpositive. The Dutch auction (with suitable reserve) is the unique optimal and strongly shill-proof auction. Moreover, the Dutch auction (with no reserve) is the unique prior-independent auction that is both efficient and weakly shill-proof. While there are a multiplicity of strategy-proof, weakly shill-proof, and optimal auctions; any optimal auction can satisfy only two properties in the set {static, strategy-proof, weakly shill-proof}.",

    "translated_abstract": "在单品拍卖中，一个欺诈性的卖家可能会伪装成一个或多个竞标者，以操纵成交价格。本文对那些免疫作弊的拍卖格式进行了表征：一个利润最大化的卖家没有任何动机提交任何虚假报价。我们区分了强免疫作弊，即一个了解竞标者估值的卖家永远无法从作弊中获利，和弱免疫作弊，它仅要求从作弊中得到的平衡预期利润为非正。荷兰式拍卖（设有适当保留价）是唯一的最优和强免疫作弊拍卖。此外，荷兰式拍卖（没有保留价）是唯一的具有先验独立性的拍卖，既高效又弱免疫作弊。虽然存在多种策略证明、弱免疫作弊和最优拍卖；任何最优拍卖只能满足集合 {静态、策略证明、弱免疫作弊} 中的两个性质。",
