    "translated_abstract": "随着电动汽车（EV）数量的增加，人们对当前充电和电网基础设施容量的担忧日益加剧，必须开发智能充电解决方案。尽管近年来已开发了许多智能充电模拟器，但只有少数支持以Gym环境形式开发强化学习（RL）算法，而这些模拟器通常缺乏对V2G场景的深入建模。为解决上述问题，本文介绍了EV2Gym，这是一个用于开发和评估规模化智能充电算法的实际模拟器平台，并提供了标准化平台。所提出的模拟器采用了经过验证的真实数据进行验证的全面EV、充电站、电力变压器和EV行为模型。EV2Gym具有高度可定制的界面，用户可以从预设计的案例研究中进行选择，也可以制定自己的定制场景。",
