    "translated_abstract": "当前的大型语言模型（LLMs），即使经过调整以确保安全性和对齐性，也容易被越狱。一些研究表明，只是进一步使用良性数据（即没有有害内容的数据）对一个对齐模型进行微调，会导致安全性大幅下降。我们深入探讨良性微调不经意间导致越狱的数据中心方面。首先，我们通过两种视角表征微调数据：表示和梯度空间。此外，我们提出了一种双向锚定方法，该方法优先考虑靠近有害示例并远离良性示例的数据点。通过这样做，我们的方法有效地识别出更有可能在微调后降低模型安全性的良性数据子集。仅仅训练100个这些看似良性的数据点，就可以使微调模型肯定地回应超过70％的被测试的有害请求，相比之下，...",
