    "translated_abstract": "在多智能体机器人探测中，管理和有效利用动态环境产生的大量异构数据构成了一个重要挑战。联邦学习（FL）是一种有前途的分布式映射方法，它解决了协作学习中去中心化数据的挑战。FL使多个智能体之间可以进行联合模型训练，而无需集中化或共享原始数据，克服了带宽和存储限制。我们的方法利用隐式神经映射，将地图表示为由神经网络学习的连续函数，以便实现紧凑和适应性的表示。我们进一步通过在地球数据集上进行元初始化来增强这一方法，预训练网络以快速学习新的地图结构。这种组合在诸如火星地形和冰川等不同领域展现了较强的泛化能力。我们对这一方法进行了严格评估，展示了其有效性。",
