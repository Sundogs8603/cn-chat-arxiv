In response to privacy concerns, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a privacy-preserving approach for training, but the quality of trained models degrades as client data becomes heterogeneous. In this paper we propose the use of personalization layers for load forecasting in a general framework called PL-FL. We show that PL-FL outperforms FL and purely local training, while requiring lower communication bandwidth than FL. This is done through extensive simulations on three different datasets from the NREL ComStock repository.",

    "translated_abstract": "智能电表的出现使得可以广泛收集用电数据来训练短期负载预测模型。为了应对隐私问题，提出了联邦学习（FL）作为训练的隐私保护方法，但随着客户数据的异质性增加，所训练模型的质量会下降。本文提出了在一个名为PL-FL的通用框架中使用个性化层进行负载预测。我们展示了PL-FL胜过FL和纯本地训练，同时还比FL需要更低的通信带宽。通过在来自NREL ComStock数据仓库的三个不同数据集上进行广泛的模拟完成了这一点。",
