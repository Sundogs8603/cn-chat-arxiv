    "translated_abstract": "大多数早期基于3D结构的分子生成方法遵循逐个原子的范式，在蛋白质口袋内逐步添加原子到部分构建的分子片段中。这些方法在设计紧密结合的配体方面有效，但往往忽视了其他重要性质，如可合成性。片段式生成范式提供了一个有前途的解决方案。然而，原子式和片段式方法都面临一个共同的挑战，即在有限的能力下共同设计出合理的化学和几何结构，导致扭曲的构象。为了应对这一挑战，我们介绍了深度几何处理协议，这是一个更抽象的设计，将设计重点延伸到模型架构之外。通过对现有几何相关模型及其协议的全面审查，我们提出了一种新颖的混合策略，最终开发出FragGen - 一种几何可靠的片段",
