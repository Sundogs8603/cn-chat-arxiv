    "translated_abstract": "作业车间调度问题（JSSP）是一个组合优化问题，其中任务需要在机器上进行调度，以最小化诸如最大完工时间或延迟等标准。为了解决更加现实的场景，我们为每个任务的持续时间关联了一个概率分布。我们的目标是生成一个稳健的调度，即最小化平均完工时间。本文引入了一种新方法，利用深度强化学习（DRL）技术来寻找稳健的解决方案，重点关注具有不确定持续时间的JSSP。本研究的关键贡献包括：（1）DRL在JSSP应用中的进展，增强泛化性和可伸缩性，（2）一种新颖的方法来解决具有不确定持续时间的JSSP。 Wheatley方法，集成了图神经网络（GNNs）和DRL，已公开可用于进一步的研究和应用。",
