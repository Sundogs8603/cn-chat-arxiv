Knowledge graphs (KG) emerged as a promising solution to this problem by providing a flexible, scalable, and semantically rich way to organize and make sense of data. This paper builds upon a recent survey of the research literature on combining KGs and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Based on selected application scenarios from enterprise context, we discuss synergies that result from such a combination. We cover various approaches from the three core areas of KG construction, reasoning as well as KG-based NLP tasks. In addition to explaining innovative enterprise use cases, we assess their maturity in terms of practical applicability and conclude with an outlook on emergent application areas for the future.",

    "translated_abstract": "知识管理是当今数字世界中企业面临的关键挑战，随着生成和收集的数据量和复杂性不断增长，知识图谱（KG）成为解决这一问题的一种有前途的解决方案，提供了一种灵活、可扩展且语义丰富的方式来组织和理解数据。本文在最近对结合知识图谱和自然语言处理（NLP）的研究文献进行调查的基础上进行了进一步研究。基于企业背景下选定的应用场景，我们讨论了此类组合带来的协同效应。我们涵盖了知识图谱构建、推理以及基于知识图谱的NLP任务三个核心领域的各种方法。除了解释创新的企业应用案例，我们评估了它们在实际应用方面的成熟度，并最后展望了未来新兴应用领域。",
