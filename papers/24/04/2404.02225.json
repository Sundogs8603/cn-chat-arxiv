    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.02225v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: We propose CHOSEN, a simple yet flexible, robust and effective multi-view depth refinement framework. It can be employed in any existing multi-view stereo pipeline, with straightforward generalization capability for different multi-view capture systems such as camera relative positioning and lenses. Given an initial depth estimation, CHOSEN iteratively re-samples and selects the best hypotheses, and automatically adapts to different metric or intrinsic scales determined by the capture system. The key to our approach is the application of contrastive learning in an appropriate solution space and a carefully designed hypothesis feature, based on which positive and negative hypotheses can be effectively distinguished. Integrated in a simple baseline multi-view stereo pipeline, CHOSEN delivers impressive quality in terms of depth and normal accuracy compared to many current deep learning based multi-view stereo pipelines.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了CHOSEN，这是一个简单而灵活、强大且有效的多视角深度细化框架。它可以应用于任何现有的多视角立体匹配流程中，具有针对不同多视角采集系统（如相机相对定位和镜头）的直观泛化能力。给定初始深度估计，CHOSEN迭代地重新采样并选择最佳假设，并自动适应由采集系统确定的不同度量或固有尺度。我们方法的关键在于在适当的解决方案空间中应用对比学习以及精心设计的假设特征，基于这些特征，可以有效地区分正负假设。将CHOSEN集成到简单的基线多视角立体匹配流程中，在深度和法线精度方面提供了令人印象深刻的质量，与许多当前基于深度学习的多视角立体匹配流程相比有所提高。",
