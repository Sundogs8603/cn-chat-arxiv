    "translated_abstract": "时间知识图问题回答（TKGQA）旨在回答关于时间意图的问题，涉及时间知识图（TKG）。该任务的核心挑战在于理解问题中关于多种类型时间约束（如 before、first 等）的复杂语义信息。现有的端到端方法通过学习问题和候选答案的时间感知嵌入隐式建模时间约束，这离全面理解问题还有很大差距。受显式建模问题中约束的语义解析方法的启发，通过生成带有符号操作符的逻辑形式，我们为时间约束设计了基本的时间操作符，并引入了一种新颖的自我提升编程方法用于 TKGQA（Prog-TQA）。具体而言，Prog-TQA利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的上下文学习能力来理解问题中的组合时间约束。",
