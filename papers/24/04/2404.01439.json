About twenty billion are typed in Twitter nowadays, and new emojis keep appearing in each new Unicode version, making them increasingly relevant to sentiment analysis tasks.

    "translated_abstract": "线上媒体，如博客和社交网络网站，生成了大量非结构化数据供分析个人和组织的观点和情感之用。传统的自然语言处理方法已经不能很好地量化这些观点的极性度量，因此需要新颖的方法。迄今为止，表情符号所表达的情感得到的关注较少。然而，过去四年间，符号的使用量激增。如今，Twitter中每天会被输入大约两百亿个符号，并且每个新的Unicode版本都会增加新的表情符号，使得它们对情感分析任务越来越重要。这促使我们提出了一种新颖的方法来预测在线文本消息（如推文）中表情符号表达的情感，该方法不需要人工手动注释数据，以此节省宝贵的时间用于其他分析任务。为此，我们自动构建了一种新颖的表情符号情感词库。",
