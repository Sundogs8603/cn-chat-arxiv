    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.01495v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A growing number of applications involve settings where, in order to infer heterogeneous effects, a researcher compares various units. Examples of research designs include children moving between different neighborhoods, workers moving between firms, patients migrating from one city to another, and banks offering loans to different firms. We present a unified framework for these settings, based on a linear model with normal random coefficients and normal errors. Using the model, we discuss how to recover the mean and dispersion of effects, other features of their distribution, and to construct predictors of the effects. We provide moment conditions on the model's parameters, and outline various estimation strategies. A main objective of the paper is to clarify some of the underlying assumptions by highlighting their economic content, and to discuss and inform some of the key practical choices.",

    "translated_abstract": "越来越多的应用涉及到研究人员比较不同单位以推断异质效应的情况。研究设计的例子包括孩子在不同社区间的移动、工人在不同公司之间的转移、从一个城市迁移到另一个城市的患者，以及银行向不同公司提供贷款。我们提出了一个基于具有正态随机系数和正态误差的线性模型的统一框架。利用这个模型，我们讨论了如何恢复效应的均值和离散度，它们分布的其他特征，并构建效应的预测器。我们对模型参数提供矩条件，并概述了各种估计策略。本文的主要目标是通过突出其经济内容来澄清一些潜在假设，并讨论和指导一些关键实际选择。",
