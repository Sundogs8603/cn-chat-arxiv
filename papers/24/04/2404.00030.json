    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.00030v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Sports visualization focuses on the use of structured data, such as box-score data and tracking data. Unstructured data sources pertaining to sports are available in various places such as blogs, social media posts, and online news articles. Sports visualization methods either not fully exploited the information present in these sources or the proposed visualizations through the use of these sources did not augment to the body of sports visualization methods. We propose the use of unstructured data, namely cricket short text commentary for visualization. The short text commentary data is used for constructing individual player's strength rules and weakness rules. A computationally feasible definition for player's strength rule and weakness rule is proposed. A visualization method for the constructed rules is presented. In addition, players having similar strength rules or weakness rules is computed and visualized. We demonstrate the us",

    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2404.00030v1 公告类型：跨领域 体育可视化关注于使用结构化数据，如比赛数据和跟踪数据。与体育相关的非结构化数据来源包括博客、社交媒体帖子和在线新闻文章等。体育可视化方法要么没有充分利用这些来源中存在的信息，要么通过利用这些来源提出的可视化方法没有增强体育可视化方法的范围。我们提出利用非结构化数据，即板球短文本评论进行可视化。短文本评论数据用于构建个人球员的实力规则和弱点规则。我们提出了一个计算上可行的球员实力规则和弱点规则的定义。我们提出了构建规则的可视化方法。此外，计算并可视化具有类似实力规则或弱点规则的球员。我们展示了用于可视化这些规则和球员的方法。",
