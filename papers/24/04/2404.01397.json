    "translated_abstract": "现今，用户需求增加了对视觉系统个性化的要求，从少样本数据集中仅仅识别和定位个人实例（例如，我的狗而不是狗）。尽管深度网络在传统标注丰富的基准上取得了出色的结果（例如，最新YOLOv8模型的标准目标检测），但它们很难保持类内变异性以表示不同实例而不仅仅是对象类别。我们构建了一种基于抽取特征的多阶统计的对象条件实例袋（OBoI），在这里，将通用对象检测模型扩展到搜索并从 OBoI 的度量空间识别个人实例，无需反向传播。通过依赖多阶统计，OBoI 在区分不同实例方面实现了一致的超凡准确性。在结果中，我们在18个个人实例的情况下实现了77.1% 的个人对象识别准确度。",
