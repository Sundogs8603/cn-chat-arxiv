    "translated_abstract": "椎体骨折分级分类骨折严重程度，这在医学成像中是一项具有挑战性的任务，近年来吸引了深度学习（DL）模型。尽管DL辅助医学诊断等关键应用场景需要透明性和可信度，但只有少数工作尝试使这种模型具有人类可解释性。此外，这些模型要么依赖于事后方法，要么依赖于额外注释。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的可解释-by-design方法ProtoVerse，以在人类可理解的方式中找到相关的椎体骨折子部分（原型），可可靠地解释模型的决策。具体来说，我们引入了一种新颖的多样性促进损失，以减轻在具有复杂语义的小数据集中原型重复的问题。我们在VerSe'19数据集上进行了实验，并优于现有的基于原型的方法。此外，我们的模型在解释性方面表现更优秀。",
