Complete extraction requires combining information across text, tables, and figures, whereas prior work has mainly investigated extracting reactions from single modalities. In this paper, we present OpenChemIE to address this complex challenge and enable the extraction of reaction data at the document level. OpenChemIE approaches the problem in two steps: extracting relevant information from individual modalities and then integrating the results to obtain a final list of reactions. For the first step, we employ specialized neural models that each address a specific task for chemistry information extraction, such as parsing molecules or reactions from text or figures.

    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2404.01462v1 公告类型：交叉  摘要：从化学文献中提取信息对于构建数据驱动化学的最新反应数据库至关重要。完整的信息提取需要结合文本、表格和图像中的信息，而以往的工作主要研究从单一方式提取反应。在本文中，我们提出了OpenChemIE来解决这一复杂挑战，实现在文档级别提取反应数据。OpenChemIE分两步解决问题：从各个方式中提取相关信息，然后整合结果得到最终的反应列表。对于第一步，我们采用专门的神经模型，每个模型处理化学信息提取的特定任务，比如从文本或图像中解析分子或反应。然后我们使用化学相关的算法整合这些模块的信息，实现精细化反应提取。",
