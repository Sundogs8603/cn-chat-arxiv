    "translated_abstract": "非欧几里德数据在不同领域经常遇到，但关于用流形表示作为输出训练神经网络的基本挑战的文献有限。我们在这个背景下引入了一个名为深度外在流形表示（Deep Extrinsic Manifold Representation，DEMR）的技巧，用于视觉任务。DEMR将外在流形嵌入融入到深度神经网络中，有助于生成流形表示。DEMR方法不直接优化复杂的测地线损失，而是专注于优化嵌入欧几里德空间内的计算图，从而适应各种架构需求。我们提供了支持所提概念的实证证据，涉及两种流形，$SE(3)$ 及其关联商流形。这些证据为所提取概念的可行性、渐近性质和泛化能力提供了理论保证。",
