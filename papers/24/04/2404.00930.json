    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.00930v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a novel end-to-end personality-based synthetic dialogue data generation pipeline, specifically designed to elicit responses from large language models via prompting. We design the prompts to generate more human-like dialogues considering real-world scenarios when users engage with chatbots. We introduce PSYDIAL, the first Korean dialogue dataset focused on personality-based dialogues, curated using our proposed pipeline. Notably, we focus on the Extraversion dimension of the Big Five personality model in our research. Experimental results indicate that while pre-trained models and those fine-tuned with a chit-chat dataset struggle to generate responses reflecting personality, models trained with PSYDIAL show significant improvements.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的端到端基于个性化的合成对话数据生成流水线，专为通过提示从大型语言模型中引出回应而设计。我们设计提示以生成更符合真实世界场景的对话，当用户与聊天机器人互动时。我们介绍了PSYDIAL，这是第一个专注于基于个性化对话的韩语对话数据集，使用我们提出的流水线策划。值得注意的是，在我们的研究中，我们专注于大五人格模型的外向性维度。实验结果表明，虽然预训练模型和那些用聊天数据集进行微调的模型很难生成反映个性的回应，但通过PSYDIAL训练的模型显示出显著改进。我们的流水线的多功能性不仅局限于对话任务，还为其他非对话相关应用提供潜力。这项研究打开了更为微妙、个性驱动的交谈的大门.",
    "tldr": "该研究提出了一种新颖的基于个性化的合成对话数据生成流水线，引入了PSYDIAL韩语对话数据集，针对大型语言模型生成更符合真实场景的人类化对话，实验证明相较于预训练或微调模型，使用PSYDIAL训练的模型在生成符合个性的回应上有显著提升，且该流水线具有非对话相关应用的潜力。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study introduces a novel personality-based synthetic dialogue data generation pipeline, presents the PSYDIAL Korean dialogue dataset, focuses on generating more human-like dialogues for large language models, demonstrates significantly improved personality-driven response generation with models trained on PSYDIAL compared to pretrained or fine-tuned models, and highlights the potential of this pipeline for non-dialogue related applications."
