    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.02498v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: For optimal stopping problems with time-inconsistent preference, we measure the inherent level of time-inconsistency by taking the time needed to turn the naive strategies into the sophisticated ones. In particular, when in a repeated experiment the naive agent can observe her actual sequence of actions which are inconsistent with what she has planned at the initial time, she then chooses her immediate action based on the observations on her later actual behavior. The procedure is repeated until her actual sequence of actions are consistent with her plan at any time. We show that for the preference value of cumulative prospect theory, in which the time-inconsistency is due to the probability distortion, the higher the degree of probability distortion, the more severe the level of time-inconsistency, and the more time required to turn the naive strategies into the sophisticated ones.",

    "translated_abstract": "对于具有时间不一致偏好的最优停止问题，我们通过将从天真策略转变为复杂策略所需的时间来衡量时间不一致的固有水平。特别是，在重复实验中，当天真代理可以观察到她的实际行动序列与最初计划不一致时，她会根据后续实际行为的观察选择立即行动。该过程重复进行，直到她的实际行动序列在任何时间点都与她的计划一致。我们表明，对于累积概率理论的偏好值，其中时间不一致由于概率失真导致，概率失真程度越高，时间不一致程度就越严重，需要的时间转变从天真策略到复杂策略也更多。",
