    "translated_abstract": "Twitter已经成为全球参与在线对话的中心，也成为各个学科研究语料库的重要来源，这些学科已经意识到其用户生成的内容的重要性。论点挖掘是处理和理解在线话语的重要分析任务。具体来说，它旨在识别论点的结构要素，表示为信息和推理。然而，这些要素并不是静态的，可能需要在所在对话中设置上下文，然而缺乏解决Twitter上这一动态方面的数据和注释框架。我们贡献了TACO，这是第一个利用1,814条涵盖200场完整对话、涵盖六个异质主题的推文的Twitter Arguments数据集，并在六名专家之间以0.718的Krippendorff's alpha达成一致。其次，我们提供了我们的注释框架，结合了来自剑桥词典的定义，以定义和识别。",
