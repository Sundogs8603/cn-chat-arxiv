    "translated_abstract": "测试时间适应已被证明在适应给定训练模型到具有潜在分布转移的未见测试样本时是有效的。然而，在现实场景中，模型通常部署在资源有限的设备上，例如FPGA，并且通常被量化和硬编码为不可修改的参数以加速。鉴于此，由于现有方法严重依赖于计算密集型的反向传播进行模型更新，因此这些方法通常是不可行的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种测试时间前向适应（FOA）方法。 在FOA中，我们试图通过一个无导数的协方差矩阵适应进化策略来仅学习新添加的提示（作为模型的输入）。 为了使这种策略在我们的在线无监督设置下稳定工作，我们设计了一种通过衡量测试训练统计差异和模型预测熵的新颖适应函数。此外，我们设计了一种激活移位方案。",
