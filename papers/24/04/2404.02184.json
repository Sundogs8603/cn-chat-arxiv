A wide range of candidate models were fitted to benchmark datasets from regression and classification settings. A statistical analysis using linear mixed model was carried out on prediction performance criteria resulting from model fits over random splits of the data. The results showed that the ensemble classifiers were able to consistently outperform candidate models in our application",
