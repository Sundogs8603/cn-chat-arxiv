Communication issues between these diverse stakeholders can lead to misinterpretation and misuse of algorithms. We investigate the communication processes for AI fairness-related decisions by conducting interviews with practitioners working on algorithmic systems in the public sector. By applying qualitative coding analysis, we identify key elements of communication processes that underlie fairness-related human decisions. We analyze the division of roles, tasks, skills, and challenges perceived by stakeholders.

    "translated_abstract": "在公共部门使用的人工智能算法中，例如分配社会福利或预测欺诈，通常涉及多个公共和私人利益相关者在算法生命周期的各个阶段。这些不同利益相关者之间的沟通问题可能导致算法的误解和误用。我们通过与在公共部门算法系统上工作的从业者进行访谈，调查与AI公平相关决策有关的沟通过程。通过应用定性编码分析，我们确定了支撑与公平相关的人类决策的沟通过程的关键元素。我们分析了利益相关者感知的角色、任务、技能和挑战的分工。我们利用一个概念框架来形式化潜在的沟通问题，其中i.代表了沟通模式 ii.概述了缺失元素，比如缺乏为任务提供技能的角色。该框架被用于",
