We propose and theoretically analyze two strategies that solve the problem: One based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty and the other via Thompson sampling. Our framework is generic and includes previously proposed approaches as special cases. Besides, the empirical results show that our methods significantly reduce the regret on several bandit tasks.",
