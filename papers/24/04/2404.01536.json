However, the inability of these models to properly encode numerals limits their performance on tasks requiring numeric comprehension. We introduce strategies to semantically prime numerals in any corpus by generating anchors governed by the distribution of numerals in said corpus, thereby enabling mathematically grounded representations of these numeral tokens. We establish the superiority of our proposed techniques through evaluation on a range of numeracy tasks for both in-domain (seen) and out-domain (unseen) numerals. Further, we expand our empirical evaluations to numerals ranging from 1 to 10 billion, a significantly broader range compared to previous studies of the same nature, and we demonstrate significant improvements in the mathematical grounding of our learned embeddings.",

    "translated_abstract": "现有大量预训练语言模型已成为自然语言处理管线中的事实标准，然而这些模型未能正确编码数字，限制了它们在需要数字理解的任务上的性能。我们引入了一种策略，通过在任何语料库中生成受数字分布规律控制的锚点来在语义上引导数字，从而实现这些数字标记的数学基础表示。我们通过对一系列数值任务进行评估，证明了我们提出的技术的优越性，对领域内（已见）和领域外（未见）的数字都适用。此外，我们将实证评估扩展到从1到10亿的数字范围，比以往相同类型研究的范围广得多，展示了我们学得的嵌入向数学上的显著改进。",
