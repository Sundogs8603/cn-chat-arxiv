    "translated_abstract": "在大型金融市场的背景下，我们提出了“消失风险无超限免费午餐”的概念（NAFLVR），在这个概念下，我们可以证明在资产数目（甚至是可数无穷）无限的市场中的资产定价的基本定理（FTAP），比如债券市场。我们在Y. Kabanov（1997）所规定的可行投资组合财富过程的一般设置下工作，这种设置在连接属性上放宽了一定程度的前提条件，并根据在CT（2014）中得到的证明变体将FTAP从经典小市场情况推广到大型金融市场。在可数多个资产的情况下，我们的设置包括M. De Donno等人（2005）考虑的大型金融市场模型及其抽象集成理论。 NAFLVR的概念被证明是一个经济上有意义的“无套利”条件（尤其不涉及弱$*$-闭合），而且它与分离性存在是等价的。",
